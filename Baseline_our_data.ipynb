       "  'text': \"Chelsea are close to finalising an agreement with Southampton for the transfer of Romeo Lavia, sources have confirmed to 90min. The Blues have a long-standing interest in the midfielder having tried to sign him last summer just weeks after he first joined the Saints from Manchester City. They continued to monitor Lavia throughout his debut Premier League season, with the teenager breaking into the Belgium senior side despite Southampton's relegation. Liverpool have seen three bids for Lavia rejected by Southampton this summer as they did not meet their  £50m valuation, and the Merseysiders could now be beaten to his signature by Chelsea. feed 90min understands that a deal to take Lavia from St Mary's to Stamford Bridge worth  £55m is close to being agreed, roughly 24 hours after Chelsea reignited their interest in the 19-year-old. Lavia has not made a competitive appearance for Southampton this season due to intense speculation regarding a move away. Chelsea and Liverpool's transfer business in recent days has been intertwined. The Reds appeared to have beaten the Blues to Brighton's Moises Caicedo after launching a British-record  £111m bid on Friday morning, but the Ecuadorian is holding out for a move to west London instead. Though they intend to match Liverpool's mammoth offer in the coming hours, Brighton are yet to receive a new bid from Chelsea. Elsewhere, Chelsea have dropped their interest in Leeds United's Tyler Adams despite agreeing to pay his  £20m relegation release clause this week, with the USMNT captain now returning to Yorkshire.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Manchester United are in talks with Bayern Munich over the possible transfer of 2018 World Cup-winning defender Benjamin Pavard, 90min understands. The versatile Pavard, capable of playing as a centre-back or right-back, joined Bayern in 2019 and has entered the final year of his contract at the Allianz Arena. With Maguire in the process of leaving Old Trafford before next month   s transfer deadline, Pavard had been among a number of options to replace the former captain. As 90min revealed last week, United are preparing to enter the transfer market once Maguire   s exit is completed. The England international had initially wanted to stay and fight for his place, despite slipping down the pecking order last season and losing the captaincy early in pre-season. feed But the Red Devils agreed a  £30m fee with fellow Premier League side West Ham United. Talks have continued to hammer out the details of the proposed deal, although things have progressed slower than had been hoped. That being said, all parties expect a conclusion to still be reached soon. Pavard has been offered to United, with Nice   s Jean-Clair Todibo, ex-Ajax defender Perr Schuurs, Jarrad Branthwaite of Everton, one-time Tottenham target Edmond Tapsoba and Benfica   s Antonio Silva all considered by the club to replace Maguire. But it is the Pavard path on which United are now progressing and 90min understands that negotiations with Bayern over the transfer fee are taking place. The perennial German champions value the Frenchman at  £30m (   35m), which is higher than the  £25.9m (   30m) that United have so far proposed. That figure hasn   t yet convinced Bayern to sell, but the difference in valuation has not dissuaded the sides from continuing to talk.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Moises Caicedo is no stranger to a drawn-out transfer saga. Years before Chelsea began peppering Brighton with dizzying offers only to be outbid by Liverpool, before the Blues bid  £115m to secure his services this week, Caicedo was the subject of a multi-club tussle while he was still in Ecuador with Independiente del Valle. Manchester United, AC Milan, Brighton, Chelsea and Belgian side Club Brugge were all interested in the midfielder after a rapid ascension in senior South American football. Three separate agencies also tried to represent Caicedo and get a slice of any potentially lucrative deal. Ultimately, Brighton cut through the chaos to snag Caicedo for just  £4.5m in 2021. After less than 50 starts for the Seagulls, the 21-year-old has now become one of the most expensive players in the history of the sport. Here's how Caicedo's  £115m move to Chelsea compares to the game's other costly sagas. Chelsea confirmed the signing of Caicedo after one of the most dramatic transfer sagas of recent times. The Blues had been pursuing the midfielder for the majority of the summer, however had been unwilling to make a bid over  £80m until Liverpool agreed to fork out  £111m for his services.  Despite an agreement between Liverpool and Brighton being struck, Caicedo was unwilling to agree to a move to Anfield, opening the door for Chelsea to swoop in and have a  £115m bid accepted for his services.  The midfielder has now put pen to paper on an eight-year deal at Stamford Bridge.  Caicedo has become the most expensive signing for Chelsea and any other British club. But where does he rank on a global scale? Ranking Player Signed Joined Fee 1 Neymar 2017 PSG  £198m 2 Kylian Mbappe 2018 PSG  £163m 3 Philippe Coutinho 2018 Barcelona  £142m 4 Ousmane Dembele 2017 Barcelona  £135m 5 Moises Caicedo 2023 Chelsea  £115m 6 Joao Felix 2019 Atletico Madrid  £113m 7 Enzo Fernandez 2023 Chelsea  £107m 8 Antoine Griezmann 2019 Barcelona  £107m 9 Declan Rice 2023 Arsenal  £105m 10 Jack Grealish 2021 Manchester City  £100m Less than four years after making his senior debut as a 17-year-old in the Ecuadorian top flight, Caicedo has become the fifth most expensive footballer of all time.  Even though Caicedo's fee has scratched nine digits, Neymar's move to PSG comfortably remains the most expensive in history, with the Ligue 1 giants paying  £198m for the forward's services.  Neymar's PSG teammate Kylian Mbappe is second on the list but could have moved into top spot after Al Hilal's  £259m offer was accepted by the French champions. Mbappe ultimately refused to even meet with representatives of the Saudi giants.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Saudi Pro League director of football Michael Emenalo claims the competition can position itself as one of the world\\'s best within the next two years by targeting \\'exceptional players only\\' The former technical director of Chelsea assumed his role in July and is continuing the Pro League\\'s significant  £400m investment initiative. This strategy has enticed players such as Karim Benzema, Jordan Henderson, Riyad Mahrez, and Roberto Firmino to join Saudi Arabian clubs this summer. So far, the majority of top stars heading to Saudi Arabia, including Benzema, N\\'Golo Kante and Cristiano Ronaldo, have been in the latter stages of their respective careers. At 26, Ruben Neves is one of the exceptions to the trend and arguably not in the same bracket of star anyway. Richard Masters, chief executive of the Premier League, recently shared that he isn\\'t overly worried about Saudi Arabia\\'s unrestricted spending. However, Emenalo cautioned that there are essentially no bounds to the country\\'s willingness to invest in football players.  \"I would love  to have Kylian Mbappe here. I would love to have Harry Kane here. The league would like all the top players,\" he said. Indeed, Mbappe has already been the subject of world record  £259m bid from Al Hilal that was accepted by Paris Saint-Germain, although the plater himself wasn\\'t interested in the move. manual \"In a couple of years, this will become a league for exceptional players only. It will become a league for those who are at the top of their game. We have the resources, and we   re going to use them,\" Emenalo said. \"I don   t think it is going to take the same amount of time that it took the [English] Premier League to get there for us to establish ourselves.\" Emenalo emphasised that the Saudi Pro League\\'s aim is not to undermine the Premier League in a manner similar to LIV Golf and the PGA Tour and hopes that elite football\\'s established order in Europe will eventually be less apprehensive and collaborate with them.    The European leagues, especially the Premier League, are very strong, they have no reason to be scared,    he added.    I think there   s panic in some areas, but this is from a misunderstanding of what we are trying to do.    I saw what [Jurgen] Klopp and what [Pep] Guardiola said [about the Pro League]. One is a coach I absolutely admire and the other is a good friend of mine in Pep. First, I hope they don   t talk themselves out of a job [in Saudi Arabia] in the future. I understand their concerns. Our goal is to work together with all the leagues and be a brotherhood in the football industry.   ',\n",

       "  'text': \"Harry Maguire's proposed transfer to West Ham United has collapsed, 90min understands. After telling Maguire he is free to leave Old Trafford this summer, Manchester United initially rejected a  £30m bid from West Ham amid concerns over their ability to satisfy the centre-back's wage demands, only to eventually agree to the offer on the table. West Ham have since completed the signings of Edson Alvarez and James Ward-Prowse but talks over Maguire continued to drag on as they sought to thrash out a wage agreement with both the defender and United. 90min understands that Maguire had agreed the terms of a reduced contract with West Ham but sought a pay-off from United to compensate him for the loss in salary over the remaining two years of his deal at Old Trafford. Sources have now confirmed that no agreement was reached between Maguire and United, forcing West Ham to accept defeat in their pursuit of the centre-back. feed United had been preparing for Maguire's exit by speaking with Bayern Munich over French defender Benjamin Pavard but, as 90min revealed earlier this summer, the Red Devils fear they do not have the financial room to sign another defender with Maguire's high wages still on the books. There has been tentative interest in Maguire from elsewhere but United are not expecting more bids for the 30-year-old, who appears set to remain at Old Trafford beyond this summer. Manager Erik ten Hag is known to be happy to continue working with Maguire as a backup to Raphael Varane and Lisandro Martinez, but he recently warned the England international that he is in for a fight for minutes if he chooses to stay. Maguire remains under contract at United until 2025, with the club holding the option to extend his deal by a further 12 months.\",\n",

The former Manchester City and New York City winger will join Everton for the 2023/24 campaign after activating a clause in his contract following Leeds' relegation from the Premier League. Aston Villa also made a move for Harrison, but upon learning that he would not be fit for another six weeks, they backed away from a deal - Villa are looking at options in the transfer market having lost Emi Buendia to an ACL injury and they wanted someone who could make an immediate impact. Harrison passed a medical with Everton on Sunday but he does have a hip problem that will likely see him sidelined until after the September international break. feed Everton turned to Harrison after accepting defeat in their pursuit of his teammate Willy Gnonto. The Italy international agreed personal terms over a move to Goodison Park, but Leeds would not allow him to leave. Gnonto was one of the few Leeds players in their squad that did not have some sort of release clause, unlike Harrison. Harrison is the latest Leeds player to depart the West Yorkshire giants this summer after returning to the Championship.

       "  'text': 'Chelsea are confident that they are close to finalising a British record transfer for Brighton & Hove Albion, sources have confirmed to 90min. Liverpool had agreed a deal with Brighton to sign Caicedo on Thursday evening worth  £111m and the 21-year-old was due on Merseyside for a medical on Friday morning. However, it quickly became apparent that Caicedo was not going to travel to the north of England as he and his agents made it clear to Brighton that he would still prefer a move to Chelsea. The Blue had previously seen a number of bids rejected, the biggest of which had been worth  £80m and was still someway short of the minimum  £100m asking price required by the Seagulls. Now, whilst an agreement is not yet finalised, 90min has been informed that talks are progressing between Chelsea and Brighton and the deal is set to be worth in excess of the  £111m fee agreed with Liverpool earlier in the week. Once confirmed, it would break Chelsea\\'s own British record which they set in January when signing Enzo Fernandez from Benfica in a deal worth  £106m 90min can also confirm that talks between Caicedo have accelerated to the point that personal terms are all finalised and the Ecuadorian is ready to put pen to paper on an eight-year contract as soon as the two clubs confirm an agreement over price is in place. feed Chelsea are hopeful that they could parade both Caicedo and Romeo Lavia, who is close to finalising move from Southampton after a  £55m fee was agreed, ahead of Sunday\\'s Premier League clash with, ironically, Liverpool, who not only wanted Caicedo but also had multiple bids for Lavia rejected. For their part, Brighton are already moving forward with the belief that Caicedo is no longer theirs and boss Roberto De Zerbi considers him a former player. \"I have already forgotten about Moises,\" he said. \"I\\'m really proud of the players we have in the squad. We want to keep improving. The credit goes to the club. Bigger clubs can buy our players but they can\\'t buy our soul or spirit. \"We don\\'t have enough [players] yet, we need to complete the squad. I want players who want to come here. We are Brighton, we achieved a big target last year - the same as Liverpool, better than Chelsea. I would like players who are proud to play in Brighton.\"',\n",

       "  'text': \"Romeo Lavia is to undergo a medical at Chelsea after turning down the chance to join Liverpool, sources have confirmed to 90min. The 19-year-old's future has been the subject of intense speculation for weeks, with a departure from Southampton expected after the club's relegation to the Championship. Chelsea and Liverpool have both been pushing hard to sign Lavia, with the two clubs also doing battle to sign Moises Caicedo from Brighton in a deal that will make the British transfer record currently held by Enzo Fernandez. And just as Caicedo has chosen to move to Stamford Bridge, Lavia has decided his future is also in west London, turning down the opportunity to work under Jurgen Klopp in the process. 90min understands that the Belgian teenager will undergo a medical with Chelsea in the next 24 hours before sealing a move that could eventually be worth  £55m to Southampton. feed Caicedo is also set to imminently put pen to paper on an eight-year contract, joining forces with Fernandez and manager Mauricio Pochettino to create one of the most expensively assembled midfields in world football. Liverpool had indicated a willingness to match Chelsea's offer for Lavia, in the hope that he would choose to join the Reds, but they have again been left disappointed in their hunt for a new defensive midfielder. Fabinho has left the club this summer to join Al Ittihad in Saudi Arabia amid a complete overhaul of Liverpool's midfield. Jordan Henderson, Naby Keita, James Milner and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain have also moved on to pastures new, gutting the core of a side that failed to qualify for this season's Champions League. Alexis Mac Allister, Dominik Szoboszlai and Cody Gakpo started in an extremely attacking midfield three in the 1-1 draw with Chelsea on Sunday, though it was clear in that game that Liverpool need a more defensive-minded player to help protect the backline when the ball is turned over.\",\n",

Along with Caicedo, Liverpool have also faced stiff competition from Chelsea for their other primary midfield target Romeo Lavia. The Reds saw three bids rejected before Chelsea entered the race, initially bidding  £48m before offering  £55m. 90min reported on Sunday that Liverpool are now willing to match Chelsea\\'s bid in the hope of signing Lavia from Southampton. feed When asked by Sky Sports about the ongoing transfer battles between Liverpool and Chelsea after the clubs\\' 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge, Klopp was keen to aim a thinly-veiled dig at the Blues for their spending. \"Where   s the camera?

       "  'text': 'Brighton and Hove Albion CEO Paul Barber has confessed Moises Caicedo\\'s decision to reject a transfer to Liverpool in favour of joining Chelsea came as a surprise. Chelsea confirmed the  £115m signing of Caicedo on Monday after a tense weekend which began with Liverpool coming out of nowhere to agree a fee of  £111m to sign the Ecuador international. However, Caicedo soon made it clear that he would prefer a move to Stamford Bridge, urging Brighton to reopen negotiations with Chelsea and ultimately sealing the move he was looking for. Barber admitted to talkSPORT that Caicedo\\'s stance left Brighton in an unexpected and \"difficult\" situation as they tried to find an outcome which satisfied everyone. feed \"Liverpool are a fantastic club, you   d imagine anyone would be running up the M6 for the chance to play at Anfield, but for whatever reason, Moises and his advisors decided London was their preferred destination,\" he said. \"In that situation we   re in a difficult position; we   ve negotiated a British record deal deal and spent several days working with Liverpool, who were were professional throughout. \"At that point [when Caicedo rejected the move], we   re out of the loop, it is all between the player and Liverpool. When it became clear he isn   t going to be joining Liverpool, we have to go into a different mode, we then have to do it all again, which we did. \"We started working with Chelsea, and we had to protect our own interests which is the player. We did that and now Moises goes on to the next step in his career.\" Liverpool and Chelsea have also butted heads over Southampton midfielder Romeo Lavia who, like Caicedo, has opted to move to Stamford Bridge this summer.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Paris Saint-Germain have confirmed that Kylian Mbappe has been allowed to return to first-team training after \"constructive and positive discussions\" regarding his future.  90min reported earlier this week that Mbappe had reiterated his desire to stay at PSG beyond this summer despite not taking up his option to trigger a clause which would extend his current contract at the club until the summer of 2025. That decision not to trigger an extension had led to PSG shopping the superstar forward around this summer due to the fear of losing him as a free agent next summer. The Ligue 1 giants accepted a world record offer  of  £257m (   300m) from Al Hilal last month, but despite proposing a gargantuan contract offer to Mbappe, the PIF-backed Saudi Pro League side were  unable to persuade the France star to enter negotiations. On top of trying to sell Mbappe, PSG had also banished the player from first-team training and even refused to select him for their recent pre-season tour of Japan.  manual Now, however, the 2018 World Cup winner is back in the first-team squad and back in training with his teammates after what the club have described as positive talks regarding the player\\'s future which took place on Saturday.  A club statement on the news reads: \"After very constructive and positive discussions between Paris Saint-Germain and Kylian Mbappe before the PSG - Lorient match, this Saturday 12th August, the player was reinstated in first-team training this morning.\"  Mbappe was in the stands on Saturday for PSG\\'s 0-0 draw with Lorient in their Ligue 1 season opener, sitting alongside new teammate Ousmane Dembele, whom the club officially confirmed the signing of on Saturday morning. The pair could feature together for the first time at club level next Saturday when Luis Enrique\\'s team take on Toulouse.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Real Madrid are prepared to end their pursuit of Sevilla goalkeeper Yassine Bounou after seeing his asking price raised, 90min understands, with Chelsea's Kepa Arrizabalaga now among the club's top targets. Madrid lost usual starter Thibaut Courtois to an ACL injury earlier this week, with the Belgian stopper set to spend the majority of the coming campaign on the sidelines as a result. Sevilla's Yassine Bounou was initially targeted as a replacement after an asking price of    20m ( £17.3m) was quoted, but sources have confirmed to 90min that Sevilla are now demanding upwards of    30m (25.9m) and Madrid are prepared to walk away as a result. Club officials have drawn up a long list of potential targets, including former Manchester United star David de Gea, but further contact has been made with Kepa as Madrid seek to explore all their options. Kepa has been targeted by Bayern Munich this week as the German side seek to replace their own injured goalkeeper, Manuel Neuer, but Madrid are now exploring a rival bid for the Chelsea man. feed Chelsea have already been active in the goalkeeper market this summer, selling Edouard Mendy to Al Ahli and replacing him with Robert Sanchez of Brighton, but the interest in Kepa has seen them reignite their search for a new stopper. Long-term target Giorgi Mamardashvili of Valencia remains on Chelsea's wish list, while the Blues are also known to have considered their own move for De Gea, who is available as a free agent following his departure from United. Porto's Diogo Costa has plenty of admirers at Stamford Bridge but is understood to be too expensive for the Blues, who are locked in talks over a double deal for Brighton's Moises Caicedo and Southampton's Romeo Lavia that could cost in excess of  £160m. Madrid are relaxed about their quest for a new stopper, believing there are plenty of options available to them. Leeds United's Illan Meslier has also been added to the shortlist as the Spanish side continue their search. Publicly, manager Carlo Ancelotti has put his faith in usual deputy Andriy Lunin, who is expected to start in goal for Madrid against Athletic Club on Saturday, but a move for a new goalkeeper is expected to be made soon enough.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Real Madrid have suffered a devastating blow on the eve of the new La Liga season, losing their goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois to an anterior cruciate ligament injury. The Belgian colossus has been pivotal to Madrid's success in recent years and Carlo Ancelotti hasn't had to think twice about who to start between the sticks. Courtois has been one of the world's leading shot-stoppers and his absence will be sorely felt by the Spanish side next season. Ancelotti needs a replacement for his number one, and has looked towards his old club Chelsea for a solution. Madrid have expressed their interest in taking Blues goalkeeper Kepa on loan for next season, a deal which Chelsea may be willing to sanction given their recent acquisition of Robert Sanchez. Here's why Real Madrid want Kepa at the Bernabeu. Considering Real Madrid will be relying on Andriy Lunin in their season opener against Athletic Club, Kepa's experience and quality would be a welcome addition to Los Blancos' squad. The Spanish stopper managed 39 appearances after reclaiming his starting spot from Edouard Mendy at Chelsea last year, including two encounters with Real Madrid in the Champions League quarter-finals. Kepa performed admirably given the criticism he has received in previous seasons, establishing himself as the club's guaranteed number one. Kepa ranked in the top 24% of Premier League goalkeepers for saves (3.16), save percentage (73.3%) and goals against (1.16) per 90 last campaign. He also boasted a +0.18 rate when it came to post-shot expected goals  minus goals conceded, suggesting that Kepa was performing significantly above average in terms of his shot-stopping. His ability and competence outside of his own penalty area could also be crucial for Madrid. He ranked in the top 17% of Premier League goalkeepers for number of defensive actions per 90 outside of his box (1.82), showcasing his quality in sweeping up opposition balls over the top. While not as significant in an Ancelotti team, it will still allow Madrid to press higher up the pitch, knowing Kepa can sniff out danger when direct balls are played in behind the defence.  Overall, Kepa provides Madrid with a cost-effective and experienced option. Add this to the fact that he is Spanish and knows La Liga intimately, and it seems like something of a no-brainer for Madrid, especially if they are only exploring a loan deal. Club Appearances Saves Save percentage Clean sheets Chelsea 162 379 69.4% 57 Athletic Club 54 134 67.7% 15 Real Valladolid 40 161 77.8% 12 Ponferradina 19 51 72.9% 8 *All stats courtesy of FBref feed Despite having initially prioritised a move for Sevilla goalkeeper Yassine Bounou, the asking price for the Moroccan appears to be a stumbling block stopping the deal from progressing. Attention has therefore turned to Kepa, who has also interested Bayern Munich, but Real Madrid don't want to rush into making a signing given the multitude of options potentially available to them. Kepa, however, is under serious consideration, with Courtois set for a long spell on the sidelines. At present, Madrid are said to only be interested in loaning the 28-year-old from Chelsea, although such a deal could have an option to buy or mandatory buy clause inserted into it. Given Chelsea's expensive pursuit of Moises Caicedo and Romeo Lavia, a permanent deal that could recoup some transfer funds may be preferential.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Kepa Arrizabalaga has confirmed he hopes to seal a permanent move to Real Madrid after joining the Spanish side on an initial loan from Chelsea. After Thibaut Courtois went down with a serious knee injury, Madrid began searching for a new goalkeeper and eventually settled on Kepa, who joined on Monday in a loan deal which does not include the option for Madrid to make the move permanent. Even though there is no purchase clause in Kepa\\'s loan contract, the 28-year-old made it clear he is looking to stay in Madrid for the foreseeable future. \"I really hope Real Madrid will keep me at the end of the season,\" he told a press conference when asked if he wants to stay at Madrid. \"Today is the first day of my assignment. We have time, we\\'ll see.  \"Hopefully with my performance I can make that happen.\" feed Madrid president Florentino Perez was eager to welcome Kepa, who he described as \"one of the best goalkeepers in the world.\" \"Dear Kepa, welcome to your new home. We know very well what it means to you at this moment and how hard you have worked to be able to defend the jersey and the crest of Real Madrid,\" Perez said. \"We\\'re delighted to have you on board because you\\'re one of the best goalkeepers in the world and we want to continue building on one of the most successful cycles in our history. \"You\\'re also one of the great Spanish goalkeepers.

Don\\'t have any doubts, our fans will support you in taking on this challenge that is part of your biggest dreams. Dear Kepa, there are only a few who can experience the emotions that you are about to experience. This new period begins here with this crest full of trophies and unrenounceable values.\"',\n",

       "  'text': 'Liverpool are ready to match Chelsea   s offer for Southampton midfielder Romeo Lavia, 90min understands, with the transfer battle between the Premier League giants continuing. The two clubs have already been at war over Brighton & Hove Albion   s Moises Caicedo in recent days. Chelsea have been pursuing the Ecuador international for months, but it was Liverpool who first agreed a deal with Brighton for a British record fee of  £111m on Friday. Even then, it remained Caicedo   s preference to join Chelsea and the Blues, who had not previously offered more than  £80m, refused to throw in the towel. As it stands, Chelsea are now confident of finalising an agreement with Brighton in excess of the Liverpool offer already accepted. But Caicedo wasn   t the only player that Chelsea looked set to beat Jurgen Klopp   s team to. feed Liverpool, in need of midfielders after letting Jordan Henderson, Fabinho, Naby Keita, James Milner and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain all leave this summer, had earlier seen three bids for Lavia rejected by Southampton     they had been holding out for  £50m, with Liverpool   s best offer totalling  £45m. Suddenly, Chelsea came on the scene and submitted a  £48m bid for Lavia before raising that offer to  £55m - a fee which left the Blues confident of getting a deal done. 90min now understands that Liverpool are ready to make a fourth Lavia offer that matches Chelsea   s bid for the 19-year-old Belgian, who has played only 36 senior club games in his career. As far as Southampton are concerned, they are happy with the developments and keen to see how this bidding war between Chelsea and Liverpool plays out. Lavia, meanwhile, is yet to make known his preference one way or the other, having held positive talks with both clubs.',\n",

Chelsea had been pursuing Caicedo all summer but up until last week refused to make a bid of over  £80m, with Brighton demanding at least  £100m for the South American midfielder, until Liverpool suddenly made an offer on Thursday evening and agreed terms on a deal worth  £111m. feed With Caicedo due for a medical on Merseyside on Friday, Liverpool looked to have beaten their top-flight rivals to his signature, but it then emerged that the 21-year-old had informed Brighton of his unwillingness to finalise a move to Anfield as he preferred to join Chelsea.

Brighton will receive  £100m in guaranteed money from Chelsea with a further  £15m in add-ons, while the Seagulls will also retain a sell-on clause. Meanwhile, 90min understands that Chelsea believe they are well placed to finalise a deal to bring Southampton's Romeo Lavia to the club. Both Chelsea and again Liverpool have agreed fees with the Saints worth around  £55m for the Belgian international midfielder.\",\n",

Jurgen Klopp   s side have signed both Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboslai to strengthen in midfield since the end of last season. But with Jordan Henderson, Fabinho, James Milner, Naby Keita and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain all leaving, getting additional bodies in has still been important. Liverpool had been in hot pursuit of Romeo Lavia and then Moises Caicedo. Three bids were made for the former, who is now on course to join Chelsea from Southampton in a deal worth up to  £55m. The latter has already signed for Chelsea after the Londoners gazumped Liverpool   s accepted  £111m offer, which would have broken the British transfer record, with a  £115m bid of their own. The Reds still have plenty of potential options to recruit a midfielder and time left to do it before the transfer window closes. One they are keeping tabs on is Adams, who also nearly became a Chelsea player prior to the Lavia and Caicedo sagas reaching a conclusion. feed As 90min reported at the time, Chelsea triggered the  £20m release clause in Adams    contract with Leeds. The United States international then travelled to London for talks but ended up returning to west Yorkshire when negotiations collapsed at the same time as Lavia and Caicedo talks accelerated.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Erik ten Hag has admitted that he wants Manchester United to make a few more signings during the summer transfer window. The Red Devils have been one of the busier Premier League teams thus far this summer, spending big to sign Andre Onana, Mason Mount and Rasmus Hojlund before their first Premier League game of the season against Wolverhampton Wanderers. There have also been plenty of outgoings too, with Anthony Elanga, David de Gea and Fred among the players let go, while Harry Maguire could be set to follow suit with the club recently accepting a  £30m bid from West Ham United for the defender. feed Speaking at his pre-match press conference ahead of Monday night\\'s clash with Wolves, Ten Hag admitted that is keen to sign more players. \"I will always want more [players]! But I think every manager you could ask would also want more. But it is about the mentality; in top football we are talking about the demand, the absolute maximum. Because we demand that from our players and, in their defence, they expect it from us,\" he said. \"We are looking for the perfect situation but you never get the perfect situation. Then you have to come into your place and work for that, maybe with not the perfect situation but the perfect results.\" With Maguire set to leave,  Ten Hag may get his wish as 90min  recently reported that Man Utd are set to enter the transfer market in search of some centre-back cover. Jean Clair-Todibo, Perr Schuurs, Jarrad Branthwaite and Edmond Tapsoba have all been linked, while the club are also in talks with Bayern Munich over Benjamin Pavard too.',\n",

Caicedo has signed an eight-year contract at Stamford Bridge until 2031. \"I am so happy to join Chelsea!\" the 21-year-old said. \"I am so excited to be here at this big club and I didn   t have to think twice when Chelsea called me, I just knew I wanted to sign for the club.

       "  'text': 'From Stamford Bridge - The stage was set perfectly. Chelsea and Liverpool had been going at it hammer and tongs in the transfer market in the week leading up to their Premier League fixture at Stamford Bridge on Sunday afternoon. Moises Caicedo was, and remains, the object of their desires. The Brighton midfielder will become the most expensive player in Premier League history when he does eventually transfer, at some point in the coming week, you\\'d expect, with Liverpool initially having an offer accepted of  £111m for the Ecuadorian.  Caicedo has made his decision known that he\\'d prefer the move to west London, triggering public embarrassment for Liverpool - a club usually so efficient and proficient with their dealings to buy and sell first team players.  feed Having won the transfer pending an agreement with Brighton, which will be in the region of a quite ridiculous  £115m, Chelsea had hoped to present the player to their home support with a deal completed in the days leading up to their 1-1 draw on Sunday. One for the social media channels to rack up the engagements on, y\\'know, but it wasn\\'t to be. Caicedo wasn\\'t there, but good grief did both teams want him to be, with the need for a dominating defensive midfielder desperately obvious for both throughout a frantic, chaotic 101 minutes of opening weekend action. But what did Sunday\\'s game tell us about which team more desperately needs to break the British transfer record to sign a player with only 53 appearances in English football to his name? Liverpool might need a defensive midfielder, will try to confirm as and when pic.twitter.com/gg4CVUB0wd At least new Chelsea boss Mauricio Pochettino settled for pragmatism (in look and feel at least) as he attempted to cover the lack of defensive presence in midfield by naming a back three. Axel Disasi was named for a competitive debut alongside returning loanee Levi Colwill, with Thiago Silva relied upon in the middle. It suggested at least he was looking to stem the tide and not give too much away - though insisted post-match that his team played with four at the back. For Jurgen Klopp, it was back to gung-ho and heavy metal. You\\'d suppose you can\\'t name a six in your team if you don\\'t possess one, but Klopp went down the route of \"screw it\" with his team sheet, naming new signings Dominik Szoboszlai and Alexis Mac Allister alongside Cody Gakpo in the most attacking of midfield units.  Mac Allister was tasked with being the deepest midfielder, operating with Trent Alexander-Arnold drifting in from the right full back slot. Who needs Moises Caicedo more? Liverpool, because I\\'m not changing my system Caicedo is largely praised for his ability to cover ground, shuttling across to cover spaces left behind his teammates with the licence to attack. Fair to say both teams could have really utilised him here - first half especially - and that whichever team gets him will have a gem for next decade in a dream scenario. The opening 45 was a story of Pure, Unadulterated Barclays: Chaos Edition, with both teams\\' defences breached. Liverpool fired a warning after 12 minutes when Mohamed Salah struck the bar, but hit the front before the 20th minute after some excellent work from the Egyptian. Chelsea left far too much space for Salah to take possession and far too much space behind their back line for Luis Diaz to tap in at the far post. Plenty at fault but good defensive midfielders stop breakaways at source. There\\'d have been little Caicedo could\\'ve done about the way Chelsea\\'s equaliser came about - this was a story of space behind the back line and defenders switching off - but both teams had the ball in the net on a further occasion each only to see efforts ruled out for offside. In the second half, Conor Gallagher far better embraced the role he\\'d been given for the day as a midfield screen, while 90min POTM Enzo Fernandez grew in stature throughout with an imperious performance in possession. It meant the hosts shaded the second half, controlled the lions\\' share of possession and the chaos of the game had subsided...barring a frantic final few minutes. Who needs Moises Caicedo more?  Draw, because Conor Gallagher can\\'t play like he did in the second half every week and Liverpool do not own a senior defensive midfielder WhoScored have Chelsea\\'s pass completion at 88% compared to the visitors\\' 80%, but that could have something to do with Liverpool\\'s direct style on the day and push to get the ball forward. There were spells throughout the first half and before Chelsea found their feet where Liverpool were cutting the hosts open with direct passes through the middle and through the channels, but over the course of the game Chelsea stomped it out. The Blues themselves found moments to penetrate with vertical passes through the middle and often threatened with charges up the pitch from players in possession - they could have won the match late on following a break in that manner. You\\'d have to chalk Chelsea\\'s name on the board for better use of the ball today on the whole; namely because Enzo Fernandez is very good at football. But both teams have holes to fill. Who needs Moises Caicedo more? Liverpool, because they don\\'t have a six and won\\'t change their system During his time at Brighton, Caicedo was often seen covering in the absence of others at right back - and players nowadays - especially those who cost north of  £100m - are hugely valued for versatility. Chelsea won\\'t need that kind of cover given their options at right-sided centre back and with Malo Gusto joining the party over the summer and with Reece James named as club captain. Chelsea do need options and numbers in midfield but Caicedo\\'s name is a dream scenario and the completion of a midfield unit. Liverpool, meanwhile, only have 18-year-old Stefan Bajcetic as a natural presence in defensive midfield - and nobody else following the sales of Fabinho and Jordan Henderson, while they rely on Ibrahima Konate to cover three or four positions when Alexander-Arnold steps into midfield and Liverpool don\\'t have the ball. The Reds are in desperate need of a defensive presence in the centre and it would add levels to their game very quickly if they found the right fit. Who needs Moises Caicedo more? Liverpool Based on the evidence of today - from Jurgen Klopp\\'s decision to play Alexis Mac Allister at six while he wore 10 on his back, from Mauricio Pochettino\\'s decision to use a 3-5-2, from the second half performances of Conor Gallagher and Enzo Fernandez and from the apparent ease for opposing teams to progress through Liverpool\\'s centre, you\\'d have to say it\\'s Liverpool. Their bid has been accepted by Brighton but advances have been halted by the player, with Chelsea now primed to step in and complete the transfer in the week to come. They may even sign up Southampton\\'s Romeo Lavia to really take the biscuit - though Klopp\\'s team are to fight to the end on that one too with no decision from the player yet. If Chelsea do manage to secure their top target for the summer, they\\'ll have a midfield unit of Caicedo and Enzo which will be the envy of the Premier League for seasons to come. It\\'ll have cost in the region of  £220m for the two, but if you\\'re going for best in class, you\\'ve got to spend. Who needs Moises Caicedo more? Liverpool, but they\\'re not getting him are they?',\n",

       "  'text': 'Erik ten Hag has told Harry Maguire to leave Manchester United if he is not willing to fight for his place in the starting lineup. Maguire fell out of favour under Ten Hag during his first season in charge, making just eight Premier League starts under the new manager. Last month, the defender was stripped of the club captaincy, with the armband being given to Bruno Fernandes ahead of the new campaign. All of this has notably led to a huge amount of speculation around the player\\'s long-term future at Old Trafford, and with West Ham having seen a bid of  £30m now accepted by the Red Devils it looks as though Maguire is set to leave the club. 90min understands that although Maguire hasn\\'t been fully convinced of leaving Man Utd this summer, he is open to a move to West Ham and is likely to accept their contract offer.  Speaking about defender\\'s Man Utd future and seemingly impending transfer to the Hammers, Ten Hag told the press ahead of the club\\'s Premier League season-opener against Wolves that, if Maguire isn\\'t willing to fight for his place in the team, then he should leave. \"For Harry, he has to fight for his place. He has the ability to be a top-class centre-back, he is the best for England so why shouldn\\'t he be the best for us?\" Ten Hag said. \"But he has to prove it. When he is not confident enough to go with that fight then he has to go, he has to make the decision. But I am happy with him. feed \"We don\\'t have a squad with 11 players. Last year proved definitely we need all the players, so you need high level players who are maybe not starting but that can change, so there is an internal competition and everyone has to fight for his place. For many players that counts, when they are good they will get their games but no one can play all the games and finally, you find out what is the best team. \"In the squad now, all the positions are double and every player has the perspective to fight for his place. Then you have to show with your contribution it\\'s the best team performance. It is up to the players if they have the game time or less.\" In light of Maguire\\'s potential departure, 90min recently reported that Man Utd are set to enter the transfer market in search of some centre-back cover. Names that have been linked already include Jean Clair-Todibo, Perr Schuurs, Jarrad Branthwaite and Edmond Tapsoba. Man Utd are also in talks with Bayern Munich regarding versatile France defender Benjamin Pavard.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal have confirmed the signing of superstar forward Neymar from Paris Saint-Germain.  90min understands that the Saudi Arabian club have paid    90m ( £77.6m) for the 31-year-old\\'s services, brining an end to his six-year stay at PSG. The Ligue 1 club made Neymar the most expensive footballer in history back in 2017, signing the player for  £190m.  While the Brazilian won five Ligue 1 titles in Paris, he struggled with a number of muscle injuries throughout his time at the club, failing to make more than 22 league appearances in any of his six campaigns with the club.  Speaking to PSG\\'s official website, club chairman and CEO Nasser Al-Khelaifi said: \"It is inevitably difficult to say goodbye to a legend of the Club, which Neymar will be forever. I will never forget the day he arrived at Paris Saint-Germain, nor what he brought to our club and our project over the past six years. \"We have lived extraordinary moments and Neymar will always be part of our history. I would like to thank him and his family. We wish Neymar the best for the future and his next adventure.\"  manual Neymar has put pen to paper on a two-year deal in Saudi Arabia, and has picked the number 10 jersey to wear at Al Hilal.  Talks also remain on between PSG and Al Hilal over midfielder Marco Verratti, who could reunite with Neymar in the Middle East if the two clubs can agree on a fee. Al Hilal have been incredibly active in the transfer market so far this summer, bringing in Kalidou Koulibaly, Ruben Neves, Sergej Milinkovic-Savic and Malcom already.',\n",

Wilcox, who expects to see Lavia\\'s move sealed this week, offered fans at the BBC Solent Fans    Forum an insight into the complicated negotiations with both Liverpool and Chelsea. \"I think you know, it\\'s well known that we\\'ve had some significant interest in Romeo, we\\'ve had an offer which we accepted from Liverpool,\" Wilcox began. \"Then Chelsea came to the table.

       "  'text': \"Chelsea are moving closer to a deal to sign Crystal Palace midfielder Michael Olise, 90min understands. Arsenal and Manchester City were both intrigued by news of a  £35m release clause in Olise's contract but, as 90min reported last month, Chelsea have long been confident they would win the race for his signature. Talks over personal terms have been ongoing for weeks and now sources have confirmed to 90min that Chelsea have taken a step forward in their negotiations with Palace as they seek to get an agreement over the line. Olise, who can play both in midfield and out on the wing, spent several years in the Chelsea academy before leaving aged 14, while his brother Richard, 18, is part of the Blues' Under-21 setup currently. feed Chelsea hope to finalise Olise's signing soon but are in no rush to do so as the 21-year-old is currently sidelined with a hamstring injury he picked up at this summer's Under-21 European Championships. Olise is not expected to return to the pitch until the end of September at the earliest so there is no imminent deadline to get the Frenchman registered for any upcoming fixtures, unlike midfielder Romeo Lavia, whose transfer from Southampton could be completed in time for the Belgian to face West Ham United on Sunday alongside fellow new arrival Moises Caicedo. 90min understands that Chelsea are expected to end their midfield rebuild once the moves for Lavia and Olise are finalised, with the Blues set to switch their attention to finding a goalkeeper to replace Kepa Arrizabalaga, who joined Real Madrid on loan and admitted during his presentation that he wants to stay in Spain beyond this season. A new striker is also a possibility for Chelsea, who lost Christopher Nkunku to a knee injury for the next four months.  Nicolas Jackson has impressed up top for Mauricio Pochettino's side, but Chelsea are otherwise short in attack as 21-year-old Armando Broja is still pushing to return from an ACL injury. Academy striker Mason Burstow was on the bench for the season-opener against Liverpool.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Paris Saint-Germain forward Neymar will complete his transfer to Al Hilal this week and has already picked out his new shirt number, sources have confirmed to 90min. The Brazil superstar will bring to an end his six-year stay in the French capital after agreeing terms on a two-year contract with the Saudi Pro League side. During his time with PSG, he averaged just 19 Ligue 1 matches per season and was continually criticised for his injury record and lifestyle away from the pitch. Neymar will wrap up a move to Saudi Arabia this week with Al Hilal set to pay    90m ( £77.6m) to PSG, and 90min understands the 31-year-old has been given the freedom to pick a new shirt number. Instead of taking on a new digit, Neymar will stick with his tried and tested number 10, which is currently free and will not need to be vacated. feed Neymar has worn the 10 shirt throughout his time at PSG and has played most of his games for Brazil with that number. He previously took the number 11 at Santos and Barcelona.  Sources have also told 90min that Al Hilal have not given up hope of signing Aleksandar Mitrovic. They reached an agreement with the Serbia international over personal terms earlier this summer, but despite indicating a willingness to pay    58m ( £50m), Fulham were unwilling to sanction a sale. PSG, meanwhile, are continuing their squad clear-out with the departures of Leandro Paredes and Renato Sanches to Roma. Argentine World Cup winner Paredes is set to return to the Stadio Olimpico after a previous spell with the Giallorossi on a permanent two-year deal, while Sanches is joining on an initial loan with an obligatory purchase clause if he plays in more than 60% of their Serie A matches this season.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Manchester United   s hopes of offloading fringe midfielder Donny van de Beek to Real Sociedad have taken a hit amid stalled talks, 90min understands. Van de Beek was a Ballon d   Or nominee in 2019 thanks to his starring role for Erik ten Hag   s Ajax team on their journey to getting within seconds of the Champions League final. But a cruel combination of difficulty adapting to more physical English football, injuries, poor form and a lack of confidence has seen the Dutchman struggle to make an impact at Old Trafford, even after being reunited with former boss and mentor Ten Hag last season. As 90min has reported, Van de Beek has been exploring his options to leave throughout the summer, with his agents in contact with a number of European clubs. That follow decisions from Ten Hag, who retains a healthy relationship, and the club to give him permission to move on. In addition to AC Milan, Inter and Roma, there was Premier League interest from Wolves, Nottingham Forest and Crystal Palace, plus from Celtic north of the Scottish border. feed An offer from Real Sociedad came in early August, with the Spanish club proposing a loan with option to buy ahead of their return to the Champions League this season. However, a problem has arisen. 90min understands that the two clubs have so far been unable to come to an agreement over the exact make up of the deal. Van de Beek himself remains particularly keen and so there is still an underlying expectation that it will happen, but there is now a threat of Real Sociedad potentially walking away altogether. United have already successfully offloaded Fred to Fenerbahce, raising  £13m in the process, and departures from the midfield are important to free up space on the wage bill as the club continues to target Fiorentina and Morocco star Sofyan Amrabat.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Bayern Munich have completed the long-awaited signing of Harry Kane from Tottenham Hotspur. The 30-year-old has signed a four-year contract with the Bundesliga giants, bringing the curtain down on a glittering Spurs career that saw him usurp Jimmy Greaves as the club\\'s all-time record goalscorer. Kane has been Bayern\\'s primary target this summer, as the Bavarians look to finally replace the guaranteed goals of Robert Lewandowski, and have finally got a deal over the line after months of negotiating with Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy. 90min understands that Bayern will pay    100m ( £86.4m) to Tottenham for Kane, but the deal could be worth more should potential add-ons be triggered. \"Bayern is one of the biggest clubs in the world, and I   ve always said that I want to compete and prove myself at the highest level during my career,\" Kane told Bayern\\'s media team after confirmation of the move. \"This club is defined by its winning mentality.\" Kane leaves the Premier League widely regarded as one of the greatest strikers of the modern era. A Spurs academy graduate quickly dubbed \\'one of our own\\', he broke into the first team towards the back end of the 2013/14 season, before scoring 21 Premier League goals and 31 in all competitions the following year. manual The club\\'s famous number 10 shirt was soon his, and Kane continued to deliver the goods for Tottenham in addition to becoming one of England\\'s best players. He won multiple Premier League Player of the Month awards (seven in total) and was named in the PFA Premier League Team of the Year five times. Kane also bagged the Premier League Golden Boot three times, though his career-best 30 goals during the 2017/18 season was not enough to earn him the gong ahead of Mohamed Salah. That goal haul was matched last season despite Tottenham\\'s struggles in the Premier League, and it was apparent that Kane, who came close to leaving the club a couple of years ago to join Manchester City, may need to leave in order to fulfil his trophy ambitions. With just a year left on his contract, Real Madrid and Manchester United were expected to pounce, but it\\'s Bayern Munich who have got a deal over the line after months of courting. Kane is believed to have been registered in time to play in Saturday\\'s night German Super Cup final against RB Leipzig - a game that could see Kane lift the first silverware of his club career less than 24 hours after arriving in Germany.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Bayern Munich have told Manchester United that they want a fee of    40m ( £34.5m) plus add-ons for Benjamin Pavard, 90min understands. The 27-year-old is keen to leave the Allianz Arena this summer in search of a new challenge having lifted numerous trophies since arriving in Bavaria from Stuttgart in 2019. United, meanwhile, are keen to sign a new centre-back as they attempt to offload Harry Maguire to West Ham United in a  £30m deal, with Pavard's name high up on an extensive list of potential transfer targets. 90min previously revealed that United had open talks with Bayern over a deal for Pavard, who can play at right-back and at centre-back, and were working towards a deal that valued the World Cup winner at    35m ( £30m). But sources have confirmed to 90min that Bayern have communicated to United that they're looking for    40m plus add-ons for Pavard, much to the chagrin of the 13-time Premier League winners. Pavard is said to be unimpressed with Bayern's change in stance, with personal terms agreed in principle over a move to Old Trafford, with United also surprised by the moving of the goalposts. feed Talks are ongoing between the two parties, with United in particular keen to find a resolution, but Bayern's inability to land Kyle Walker from Manchester City means the Bundesliga giants could change their stance entirely on a potential sale. Jean-Clair Todibo, Perr Schuurs, Jarrad Branthwaite, Edmond Tapsoba and Benfica   s Antonio Silva are other options being considered by United, as they bid to strengthen the depth of Erik ten Hag's squad, though they don't offer the same positional versatility that Pavard does. To add fuel to the rumour fire, Pavard liked an Instagram post from United's official Instagram account that celebrated Raphael Varane's winner against Wolves on Monday night - though the two are international teammates and are known to be close friends. United have signed Andre Onana, Mason Mount and Rasmus Hojlund for significant transfer fees this summer, also adding Jonny Evans to their squad on a short-term deal. There have also been a number of outgoing this summer, with David de Gea and Freed the most high-profile exits to date. Maguire may follow, providing he gives an imminent answer to West Ham over a move to London Stadium, and there's continued speculation over the future of midfielder Scott McTominay.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Tottenham Hotspur defender Eric Dier could leave the club before the end of the summer transfer window with a number of teams considering a move for him, sources have confirmed to 90min. Dier has less than one year left to run on his Spurs contract but an agreement over an extension has not been reached and is not believed to be close. 90min were first to report back in June that Tottenham would be open to selling Dier as he was not in the immediate plans of new head coach Ange Postecoglou. The 29-year-old was left out of Spurs' matchday squad for their Premier League opening day draw at Brentford on Sunday, with Postecoglou revealing this was a tactical decision as Dier was fully fit. He was also omitted from the Greek-Australian's new-look leadership group despite playing a prevalent role under previous managers. With new vice-captain Cristian Romero, summer signing Micky van de Ven, Davinson Sanchez and Ben Davies all ahead of Dier in the pecking order, he could leave before the window closes, with Tottenham looking to trim their bloated squad ahead of the deadline on 1 September. Dier, who grew up in Portugal from the age of seven, admitted last year that he would like to play abroad again, and 90min understands he could get his wish. Former side Sporting CP would contemplate a reunion if they were to sell in-demand defender Goncalo Inacio in the next few weeks, while Lisbon rivals Benfica are also monitoring Dier in case their own highly-rated centre-back Antonio Silva leaves. However, it is likely that both clubs will keep hold of their homegrown stars for the time being. feed Ligue 1 side Monaco, who have been linked with Fulham defender and Tottenham target Tosin Adarabioyo, have asked Tottenham about the availability of Dier, as have a number of Bundesliga teams. Closer to home, London neighbours Crystal Palace and Scottish champions Celtic are believed to be admirers of Dier. There is also pressing interest in Dier from Saudi Pro League side Al Nassr, who already have the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Sadio Mane on their books. Unlike Dier's other suitors, they would be able to pay Spurs a more generous transfer fee, with European clubs looking for a cut-price deal. Dier joined Tottenham from Sporting back in 2014 and was one of their first signings under Mauricio Pochettino. He spent much of his debut season playing at right-back or centre-back before being moved into midfield under the Argentine. Since Spurs hired Jose Mourinho in 2019, Dier has almost exclusively played in his preferred centre-back role. He's played 361 games in all competitions for the Lilywhites.\",\n",

In a bombshell summer which has seen Lionel Messi depart and Kylian Mbappe made available for transfer, PSG are also looking to part ways with Neymar before the current transfer window comes to a close. Barcelona president Joan Laporta is understood to be keen on a reunion with Neymar but manager Xavi has publicly claimed that the Brazilian is not part of the club\\'s transfer plans. However, that hasn\\'t stopped Roberto from reaching out to Neymar about a possible return to the club this summer. \"I\\'m excited because, at the end of the day, he\\'s an ex-teammate who is a friend and with whom I have experienced many good things over many years,\" Roberto told SPORT. \"When he was in the team, they were some of the best years I\\'ve had at Barca, we won everything. \"He\\'s a very different player from the others, I\\'m sure he would contribute a lot to us, but I\\'m not the one who decides.

       "  'text': 'As the years go by, more and more money is being spent by clubs in the transfer market. Lucrative broadcasting rights, commercial deals and other premium sponsorship means clubs are richer than ever, particularly if they have happen to being playing in the Premier League. The biggest transfers seen in world football may have happened around continental Europe, sure, but the level of spending in England, and regularity of it, is at an all-time high. And with Moises Caicedo\\'s  £115m move from Brighton to Chelsea now complete, the British transfer record has been smashed a whopping 19 times since the Premier League\\'s inception in 1992. Here\\'s every player and move to hold that accolade... Alan Shearer had only scored 23 goals in 118 appearances for Southampton by the time he left for Blackburn Rovers in 1992 - an average a goal just over every five games. But the soon-to-be Premier League winners, who had earned their place in the top flight via the second tier play-offs, knew exactly what they were getting with Shearer. A player who finish with both feet, bury headers for fun, and smash them in from close range and from long distance. Not even Blackburn could have imagined Shearer\\'s time at Ewood Park to go as well as it did, mind you. He scored 112 goals for the club four seasons - one of those was severely disrupted by injury - and scored over 30 in each of his final three, including lifting the title in 1995. One of Sir Alex Ferguson\\'s greatest pieces of work was nipping in ahead of Blackburn, who were being bankrolled by multi-millionaire Jack Walker, to sign Roy Keane for Manchester United. It was a genuine move from Ferguson as Keane spearheaded United\\'s domination of the Premier League for the next decade -  the Irishman establishing himself at the very top of the game in terms of performance level and leadership qualities. Seven Premier League crowns and five appearances in the PFA Premier League Team of the Year tells you all you need to know. Fresh from scoring 25 goals for Norwich City in the 1993/94 Premier League season, Chris Sutton was picked up by Blackburn for  £4m to partner Shearer up front. The transfer was an immediate success as the dynamic duo, flanked by Stuart Ripley and Jason Wilcox on the wings, scored goals for fun to steer Rovers to the title on the final day of the season. Sutton stayed at the club for further four years, bagging a career-best 18 league goals in Blackburn colours during the 1997/98 season. If you\\'re of a certain age, you\\'ll know the saying \\'Cole score goals\\'. Sir Alex Ferguson and Manchester United certainly knew it, which is why they decided to fork out  £7m to sign Cole from Newcastle United in January 1995, including send Keith Gillespie the other way. He scored 12 in 18 during his first half season in red and another 81 across the next six years. Multiple Premier League titles followed as a result, with Cole\\'s superb lob over Ian Walker to secure the 1998/99 crown one of his finer moments. Dennis Bergkamp arrived at Arsenal to huge fanfare in 1995 and it didn\\'t take the Dutchman long to drag the club out of the mid-table doldrums. Under the management of Arsene Wenger, Bergkamp helped transform the Gunners into genuine title contenders, forming a deadly partnership up front with Ian Wright while linking up with the brilliant Marc Overmars on the wing. Arsenal won the Premier League title in 1997/98, 2001/02 and 2003/04, with Bergkamp\\'s contributions earning him a statue outside the Emirates Stadium. \"Collymore closing in!\" is among the most iconic lines of commentary in Premier League history. It was uttered by Martin Tyler, former voice of Sky Sports, in the final moments of the iconic 4-3 thriller between Liverpool and Newcastle in April 1996. It also had a defining impact on that season\\'s title race, costing Newcastle in their fierce battle with Manchester United. Collymore\\'s rise had been rapid to the say the least. He had struggled to make an impact in the top flight as a teenager with Crystal Palace, before joining Nottingham Forest in the second tier afetr a spell at Southend. He then took his prolific lower league form into the Premier League and was poached by Liverpool for a British record fee after just one season (and 22 goals). Alan Shearer\\'s move to boyhood club Newcastle in 1996 wasn\\'t just a British record transfer, it was a world record too - the  £15m deal surpassed the  £13.2m that Barcelona paid to PSV Eindhoven for Brazilian prodigy Ronaldo only weeks earlier that same summer. Manchester United were also very keen on Shearer too, but were famously to the deal. Most thought it was Shearer\\'s desire to join his home town team, who had narrowly missed out on the 1995/96 Premier League title and played some of the best football in the country under Kevin Keegan. But then Manchester United chairman has claimed in more recent years there was more to it. \"Shearer had been to Alex Ferguson\\'s house, spoke to him and assured him he wanted to come [to Manchester],\" Edwards said on a podcast while promoting a book in 2019. \"The problem, I think, was with the chairman of Blackburn, Jack Walker, who was not a great fan of Manchester United...local rivals, both Lancashire clubs. He did not want Alan Shearer to come to Manchester United. Shearer was quite close to Walker, who was like a father figure to him, and I don\\'t think Alan wanted to upset him by coming to United. And I\\'m not sure Jack would have let him come anyway, whereas he was happy for Alan to go to Newcastle, I don\\'t think that was a threat to him.\" Shearer went on to score 206 goals in 10 years at Newcastle, breaking the club\\'s all-time record previously held for decades by Jackie Milburn. Leeds made Rio Ferdinand the world\\'s most expensive defender when they paid  £18m to West Ham in the final weeks of 2000. The club\\'s overspending would later lead to their financial demise, but the good times briefly rolled with Ferdinand dressed in all-white at the back. A few months after his arrival in west Yorkshire, the centre-back scored a famous goal in a Champions League quarter-final demolition of Deportivo La Coruna. His presence also coincided with a massive upturn in their domestic form, losing just two Premier League games in the second half of 2000/01 after a poor start to the campain. Manchester United had initially agreed to sign Ruud van Nistelrooy in 2000, only for the transfer to fall through over concerns about fitness. The Dutch stiker then suffered a dreaded ACL injury during a PSV Eindhoven training session, but United were still prepared to shell out a record fee in 2001. His goalscoring was immediate, netting twice on his Premier League debut and scoring 36 in all competitions on his first season, upping that number to 44 in his second. Van Nistelrooy finished his United career in 2006 with 150 goals in 219 games, an average of 30 per season, but is arguably an underrated part of the club\\'s modern history because of what the likes of Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo went on to achieve in the years that immediately followed. \"I used to get excited when the club would sign a big player because that   s the nature of the game. Veron came to the club, he was an excellent player, okay it didn   t work out for him at United, but he was an excellent player,\" Roy Keane said in 2020, looking back on Juan Sebastian\\'s two seasons at Manchester United. Veron signed for United having developed a lofty reputation thanks to his exploits in Serie A with Parma and Lazio. There was initial promise, that\\'s for sure, and the Argentine particularly enjoyed the European nights, but struggled to cope with the physical demands of an entire Premier League season without a fixed role in the team. Injuries compromised his second season at Old Trafford after a promising start to the campaign, and United opted to cut their losses and sell to Chelsea in 2003. Undeterred by Veron\\'s struggles, United broke the British record again the following summer, although Ferdinand\\'s familiarity with the English game perhaps rendered his  £29.3m arrival from Leeds substantially less of a risk.  Sir Alex Ferguson never doubted Rio\\'s capacity to become one of the world\\'s best in his position - his displays for England at the 2022 World Cup did that opinion no harm - and he rapidly developed into a stalwart of United\\'s defence. Frighteningly quick and unerringly cool in possession, Ferdinand was the ultimate modern-day centre-back. He enjoyed a stellar 12-year career at Old Trafford, lifting six Premier League trophies and the Champions League in 2008. He\\'s recognised as one of England\\'s greatest defenders and a modern Manchester United legend.  It took a little while for Ferdinand\\'s record to go, but smashed it was in the summer of 2006 as Chelsea prised former Ballon d\\'Or winner Andriy Shevchenko away from AC Milan.  The former Dynamo Kyiv hotshot emerged as one of the world\\'s most potent forwards during his time in Lombardy. Shevchenko departed Milan as their second leading scorer of all-time and with a Champions League medal in his back pocket, and the Ballon d\\'Or on his mantelpiece. However, the Ukrainian striker struggled to adjust to life in west London. His two years at Chelsea were rather forgettable. He scored here and there, and only rarely did he put together a sustained run of form. The striker\\'s apex was in the rearview mirror, that\\'s for sure, and he returned to Milan on loan for the 2008/09 season before eventually settling back in Kyiv. This signing ignited the revolution that culminated in Manchester City blossoming into the Premier League\\'s supreme force. On the same day City were bought out by the Abu Dhabi United Group, they quickly went to work and signed Brazilian star Robinho from Real Madrid for a British record  £32.5m. City had been haggling Reggina and Portsmouth for the additions of Rolando Bianchi and Benjani respectively in the preceding months, now they were negotiating with Europe\\'s elite. Money talks. Supposedly persuaded by City\\'s Brazilian contingent that included former Santos teammate Elano, Robinho signed up for the project in Manchester and made an immediate difference. His first season at the club was superb as he ended the 2008/09 as the Premier League\\'s fourth-highest goalscorer with 14. However, things quickly turned sour for the maverick attacker as injuries reduced his significance dramatically in year two. Discontent and perhaps fed up of listening to Mark Hughes, Robinho returned to Santos on loan in January 2010 and was never seen again in Manchester. Panic or sheer recruiting incompetence? Either way, Torres was never going to live up to his  £50m price tag at Stamford Bridge.  The Spaniard was no longer the phenom that took the Premier League by storm at Liverpool, with injuries reducing his explosiveness and rendering him a nondescript threat. Torres was forced to evolve and while the striker that rocked up at Chelsea was a shell of his peak-self, he remained somewhat useful. He was never prolific for the Blues during his three-and-a-half years at the club, but he did score one of the most memorable goals in Chelsea\\'s history away at Barcelona in the 2011/12 Champions League semi-finals. For that, many supporters overlooked his mammoth price tag. The ultimate maverick. A youthful but ambitious Pogba departed Manchester United for greater first-team opportunities overseas in 2012 and ended up at Juventus.  The Frenchman dazzled during his four years in Turin, swiftly evolving into the personification of a highlight reel and a bona fide superstar. Given his prestige, it was going to cost an arm and a leg for United to bring the midfielder \\'home\\'. But they did exactly that in 2016, handing Juve  £89m for his services. Now, summarising Pogba\\'s second stint at United is rather tricky. While the conclusion was somewhat sombre, the Frenchman did enjoy some scintillating runs of form at Old Trafford. However, it\\'s fair to say he couldn\\'t quite justify United\\'s massive outlay to bring him back, especially given that he eventually left for nothing (again) when he re-signed for Juve in 2022. Considering their riches, it\\'s pretty remarkable that City only appear on this list twice. Nevertheless, they made Grealish the first-ever Englishman to garner a  £100m fee in 2021.  The marvellous Brummie playmaker had put Aston Villa on his back during the 2019/20 season to keep the Villans in the Premier League, and a move away became increasingly inevitable after a fine 2020/21 campaign. City bit the bullet and acquired Grealish for a record fee after triggering his release clause, but it took the wide man a little while to find his feet at the Etihad. Adjusting to Pep Guardiola\\'s demands is never easy, and Grealish struggled to flourish in his debut season. But he excelled in year two and played an underrated role in City\\'s historic treble triumph. Overpriced, they said. Haha.  Convinced by his talent after an excellent 2022 World Cup with winners Argentina, Chelsea made a big splash in the January transfer window and signed Fernandez for a whopping  £106.8m. Despite his stellar form in Qatar during the winter, eyebrows were ubiquitously raised given the midfielder\\'s relative inexperience of European football.  He\\'d arrived at Benfica just six months prior.  Nevertheless, Fernandez stuck out for all the right reasons during his first few months in west London. He tried his utmost to ensure Chelsea looked competent, but not even he could salvage the Blues.  A controller, playmaker and potentially a final third producer all wrapped into one elegant midfield operator, Fernandez is set to take the Premier League by storm under Mauricio Pochettino at Stamford Bridge. Finding a suitable midfield partner for Fernandez was one of Chelsea\\'s key objectives in the 2023 summer transfer window, and they finally got their man.  Sure, it might\\'ve taken yet another British record fee to acquire their desired midfield target, but Moises Caicedo\\'s potential alongside Fernandez renders the outlay somewhat measured given the tandem\\'s projected dynamic.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Chelsea have triggered the release clause in the contract of Leeds United midfielder Tyler Adams, sources have confirmed to 90min. The Whites were relegated from the Premier League last season, activating a  £20m clause that allows Adams to leave Elland Road if a bidding club is prepared to pay in full. 90min revealed on Monday that Chelsea had contacted the representatives of Adams over a move to west London, and personal terms are now being discussed with the 24-year-old United States international. The Blues have also informed Leeds of their intention to pay Adams' release clause in full, and he is expected to undergo a medical within the next 24 hours. Adams is seen as a shrewd signing by those in charge at Stamford Bridge, who are working to provide manager Mauricio Pochettino with the midfield reinforcements he has publicly requested this summer. feed Chelsea are working on a number of midfield signings and recently launched a bid to rival Liverpool for Southampton midfielder Romeo Lavia, who has been on the Blues' radar for over 12 months now. After Liverpool saw a  £46m bid rejected for Lavia, Chelsea put forward an offer of  £48m, though that remains short of Southampton's  £50m asking price. Chelsea are also continuing to work on an agreement for Brighton midfielder Moises Caicedo, whose  £100m asking price has so far proven problematic. Liverpool have also made late contact with Brighton over potentially rivalling Chelsea's latest offer, which sat at  £80m, but have not progressed talks to the point of making a formal offer.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Manchester United goalkeeper Matej Kovar is on the verge of a permanent transfer away from the club as he undergoes a medical with Bayer Leverkusen, sources have confirmed to 90min. Now 23, Kovar has been with United since the age of 17. He joined from home-town club Solvacko in 2018 and has been loaned out to Swindon Town, Burton Albion and Sparta Prague during that time. It was his loan at Sparta last season that brought Kovar to wider attention. It was his very first year as a top flight starter and he helped the club win the Czech First League and return to the Champions League qualifying rounds. 90min reported in May that Kovar   s form on loan had caught the eye of his parent club. There were glowing reviews coming back from Prague and he was included in the thought process regarding the goalkeeping position long before Andre Onana was eventually signed. At a time when David de Gea was widely expected to sign a new contract at Old Trafford, United staff considered the possibility that Kovar could emerge as the Spaniard   s chief back-up and limit the need to spend big on a new goalkeeper. feed However, De Gea   s contract offer was later withdrawn and revised, ultimately leading to him leaving the club as a free agent. It accelerated the need for a readymade number one and so the club spent handsomely to sign Onana from Inter, reuniting the Cameroonian with Erik ten Hag. Kovar was briefly involved in United   s pre-season programme, playing 135 minutes of the opening two summer friendlies against Leeds and Lyon. But his immediate future now lies elsewhere. 90min understands that a  £7.8m (   9m) transfer fee has been agreed with Bayer Leverkusen and that a medical to complete the transfer is already being undertaken. Ties with Kovar have not been fully cut though, as United have retained a buy-back clause that could see him return to Manchester. Leverkusen finished sixth in the Bundesliga last season following a remarkable turnaround once Xabi Alonso was appointed head coach, having been flirting with relegation initially. It means that Kovar could have the chance to play Europa League football in 2023/24. He will compete with veteran Finland international and current Leverkusen captain Lukas Hradecky.',\n",

Bellingham was Liverpool\\'s top target heading into the summer transfer window but, when the true cost of the deal was set, the Reds ultimately pulled out and Bellingham ended up joining Real Madrid for an initial  £88.5m. Since then, however, Liverpool agreed to the surprise sales of both Jordan Henderson and Fabinho, who moved to Saudi Arabia, and Klopp admitted that unplanned income played a part in the  £111m move for Caicedo. \"I can confirm that the deal with the club is agreed,\" Klopp told a press conference when asked about the Caicedo bid. \"What did change? We are a club, we have not endless resources, we didn\\'t expect a couple of things happening in the summer - Hendo, Fab, stuff like this. We didn\\'t think about this before the summer to be honest, and when it happened, we gave it a go.

       "  'text': 'Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag has insisted the club were \\'professional\\' and followed \\'careful processes\\' in their transfer recruitment this summer. The Red Devils recently completed the signing of Atalanta\\'s Rasmus Hojlund for a fee that could reach  £72m. He is expected to become their starting striker once he returns to full fitness following a back injury, United have had a long-standing interest in Harry Kane, but they did not make any advances to Tottenham Hotspur this summer, and the 30-year-old is now set to join Bayern Munich after the two clubs agreed on an  £86.4m fee. Ahead of Monday\\'s Premier League opener at home to Wolves, Ten Hag was asked about Kane\\'s move to the Bundesliga and Man Utd\\'s own interest - with the Dutchman admitting his exit is a blow to England\\'s top flight. \"I don\\'t think that I have to go into that discussion or give an opinion about that,\" Ten Hag said. \"We are professional, the processes we do are really careful. \"We consider a lot of things but finally we make decisions, we don\\'t take decisions overnight, there is a strategy in every decision behind and we are happy with the squad we have behind us now. feed \"We have chosen a striker and we are really happy with our choice.

Hojlund won\\'t be available for the Red Devils, as he nurses his back injury, and that could put the onus on Marcus Rashford to again score the goals for Ten Hag\\'s side. The 25-year-old scored a career-best 30 in all competitions last season to earn a new five-year contract and status as the highest-paid player at the club.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk has admitted that he understands why fans have \"doubts\" over the club\\'s transfer business this summer.  The Reds made two early splashes in the transfer market this summer by signing Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai for a combined  £95m, which could grow to  £115m with the former\\'s add-ons. Liverpool have largely struggled to get any other deals over the line however, seeing three bids rejected by Southampton for Romeo Lavia and interest in defensive options such as Jurrien Timber fizzle out - with the defender instead joining Arsenal.  Coupled with that, the Reds have also let a huge number of first-team players leave the club, particularly in midfielder as captain Jordan Henderson and vice-captain Fabinho both joined Saudi Pro League teams, and the likes of James Milner, Naby Keita and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain all left as free agents. Long-serving forward Roberto Firmino has also moved on. feed All of this has ultimately led to Liverpool fans being rather unimpressed with the club\\'s transfer business and new club captain Van Dijk admitted that he understands their concerns. \"I can definitely understand it in some ways but I\\'m not a very negative person,\" he said. \"Obviously, when a lot of players are leaving, when your captain and vice-captain is leaving, and at the moment, there are only two incomings. And the way we have been playing, in possession really good but defensively when you concede goals it\\'s not as good, I can understand some people having doubts. \"Let\\'s see if more players are coming in and then we have to be ready again for a long season. It will be very tough if we look at the teams around us, but we want to be up there again, we want to be challenging again.  \"We have to be confident, we should be confident, and we should still be learning each and every day. There have been characters leaving, players who have played a big part in the success, but others have to step up. That\\'s a nice challenge in my opinion. We should be excited.\" The Reds kick-off their 2023/24 Premier League campaign on Sunday against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. ',\n",

United are on the cusp of selling Harry Maguire to West Ham United for  £30m and have identified former Barcelona defender Todibo as a potential replacement for the Englishman.

We have to wait to see who will want to buy him and if everyone finds an agreement there.  \"He is a leader, a very strong player mentally, he has improved a lot and he is ready to reach the very top level.\" United have drawn up a sizeable list of potential replacements for Maguire. Alongside Todibo, there is also interest in Torino\\'s Perr Schuurs and Everton\\'s Jarrad Branthwaite, while Bayer Leverkusen\\'s Edmond Tapsoba is seen as an expensive alternative. The Red Devils have also been offered the chance to sign versatile Bayern Munich defender Benjamin Pavard, who is in the final year of his contract and is expected to be available for a fee similar to the  £30m United are in line to receive for Maguire.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Arsenal will initially sign Brentford goalkeeper David Raya on a season-long loan with an option to then make the deal permanent in 2024, 90min understands. Raya has made it clear that he is ready to take the next step in his career, with Brentford repeatedly pointing suitors to a  £40m price tag. That figure put Tottenham and Bayern Munich off pursuing a deal, but Arsenal were able to come to a  £30m agreement earlier this week. It isn   t a straight transfer though. 90min understands that the agreement will actually see Raya sign a one-year extension to his Brentford contract so that it then expires in the summer of 2025 instead of at the end of this season     that could have seen him walk away as a free agent. He will then join Arsenal on loan for the duration of the 2023/24 season, rather than outright. At the end of the loan, the Gunners will have an option to make it permanent for the total  £30m already agreed. It is not, however, an obligation to buy. feed That gives Arsenal a get out option should Raya not succeed in establishing himself. In the same breath, should the Spaniard end up returning to Brentford, his value is protected by the contract extension and they would still have the opportunity to command a sizeable transfer fee. The proposed structure of the deal will financially benefit Arsenal, who have already splashed out more than  £200m in transfer fees this summer on Kai Havertz, Jurrien Timber and Declan Rice. Hailing from Barcelona, Raya has spent his entire senior career in English football, having moved from Catalan club Cornella to Blackburn   s academy at the age of 16 almost a decade ago.',\n",

Fred made 56 appearances for United last season, although he was primarily a back-up option and started only 12 times in the Premier League. The Brazilian has since also seen Mason Mount join the club, adding further competition for midfield places. It was the arrivals of both Christian Eriksen and Casemiro last summer that initially pushed him down the Old Trafford pecking order.

As 90min reported at the time, Galatasaray had an offer rejected in mid-July because it fell short of the  £20m asking price. Now, however, United have agreed to sell for less. The deal negotiated with Fenerbahce is worth  £13m (   15m), inclusive of add-ons.

Caicedo was due on Merseyside to undergo a medical soon after the conclusion of Klopp's presser, but has yet to arrive to complete the move to Liverpool and the club are believed to be furious at his representatives. 90min now understands that the Ecuador international has informed Brighton that he is prioritising a move to Chelsea and wants the club to allow further time to receive an acceptable offer. feed Chelsea saw bids worth  £70m and  £80m for Caicedo rejected by Brighton earlier this summer, despite being made aware that only offers north of  £100m would be considered, and sources have told 90min they will now match Liverpool's record sum in the next 24 hours in order to try and close a deal. 90min reported earlier on Friday that Chelsea were refusing to accept defeat in the race to sign Caicedo and it appears they may be given another chance to make their move for their top midfield target. Chelsea have since abandoned their pursuit of Leeds United's Tyler Adams despite agreeing a  £20m fee. Ironically, 90min understands that Brighton have been in touch with the USMNT captain's representatives regarding a move to the Amex Stadium.\",\n",

Arribas joined Madrid from the youth system at city neighbours Leganes back in 2012 and gradually rose through the ranks at Valdebebas.

Madrid are yet to replace Karim Benzema and have also let Mariano Diaz leave, but 21-year-old Arribas won   t be used to plug the attacking holes in the squad.

       "  'text': 'Juventus\\' training match against Juventus Next Gen was interrupted on Wednesday by a pitch invasion which saw supporters protest a possible move for Chelsea striker Romelu Lukaku. The clubs have spoken this summer about a possible deal for Lukaku which would also see Dusan Vlahovic head to Stamford Bridge, but while Chelsea appreciate the Serbian striker, 90min understands they have a huge issue with Juve\\'s demand for an extra  £35m as part of the deal. These negotiations came after Lukaku\\'s proposed return to Inter collapsed when the Italian side learned of talks between Juventus and the Belgian, who had privately and publicly vowed never to play for any Serie A side other than Inter. As a result, Lukaku\\'s proposed move to the Allianz Stadium has not gone down well among fans, many of whom were heard screaming \"No, we don\\'t want Lukaku\" during Wednesday\\'s friendly - chants which initially began in the stands during the first minute of the game. It\\'s worth noting that this game between Juventus and Juventus Next Gen took the place of the annual Villar Perosa friendly, in which it is tradition for fans to invade the pitch. But while the event is usually full of positivity as fans get the chance to meet players, a large number of supporters chose to use the opportunity to oppose a move for Lukaku instead. Invasione (anche senza Villar Perosa) #Juve pic.twitter.com/zpGsQcm7Ko Sources have confirmed to 90min that Chelsea are no longer entertaining the idea of a swap deal between Lukaku and Vlahovic as they do not share Juventus\\' valuation of the latter, but the Blues are still open to a straight sale if the right bid arrives for Lukaku. Options for Lukaku, who rejected an approach from Saudi Arabia earlier this summer, are proving limited after Inter closed the door on a potential transfer. \"Given what Inter has done for him, we expected him to behave differently, as a professional and as a man,\" Inter vice-president Javier Zanetti told La Gazzetta dello Sport. \"He has the right to go where he wants, of course, but he could have told us that beforehand. Nobody is bigger than the club and when building a team, you always have to consider who you are bringing into the dressing room.\"',\n",

       "  'text': \"Kylian Mbappe has reiterated his desire to stay with Paris Saint-Germain and see out the remainder of his contract in the French capital, 90min understands. The 24-year-old shocked PSG earlier this summer when he told them he would not be exercising the option to extend his contract, which is set to expire in June next year. PSG have responded by trying to sell Mbappe this summer, in a desperate bid to avoid losing one of the world's best players on a free transfer, but he has made it clear on numerous occasions that he intends to leave next year as a free agent. The Ligue 1 giants even accepted a world record offer of  £257m (   300m) from Al Hilal last month, but despite putting forward a gargantuan contract offer to Mbappe, the PIF-backed Saudi Pro League side were unable to persuade the World Cup Golden Boot winner to enter negotiations. Chelsea have also been contracted by PSG in a bid to drum up further interest in Mbappe, as have a number of other heavyweight European clubs. Mbappe was left out of PSG's recent pre-season tour of Japan and has been banished from first-team duties as the dispute between player and club rages on - sources have told 90min that club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi has even warned Fayza Lamari, his mother and agent, that Mbappe will 'not put a PSG shirt on again.' manual Despite the hostile atmopshere, Mbappe's position on the matter remains unchanged. 90min understands that he intends to spend the next 12 months in Paris before moving on to his next venture, which many believe will be at Real Madrid, and he has informed PSG of his plan. Sources close to Mbappe and Real Madrid have vehemently denied that an agreement is already in place for him to move to the Spanish capital next summer, but he came within a whisker of joining Madrid in 2022 before a last-minute change of heart saw him sign a new contract at PSG. Mbappe's sidelining is part of a radical overhaul at PSG this summer. Lionel Messi has already departed for Inter Miami, while the Parisiens are also keen to ship out Neymar. He has interest in his services from Saudi Arabia, with a potential return to Barcelona also rumoured in recent weeks.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Barcelona are not concerned about losing midfielder Ilkay Gundogan over a registration clause in his contract, 90min understands. Gundogan joined on a free transfer from Manchester City this summer, inking a two-year contract which also includes an option for the midfielder to terminate his deal if he is not registered in Barcelona's squad by the time the new La Liga season kicks off this weekend. Financial restrictions mean Barcelona have not yet registered any of their new singings - Gundogan, Oriol Romeu, Inigo Martinez - as well as any new contracts agreed this summer and the return of loanees like Ez Abde and Fermin Lopez.  As it stands, manager Xavi has just 13 eligible players for the season-opener against Getafe on 13 August, including Ousmane Dembele and Franck Kessie, who are on the cusp of leaving the club. The imminent sales of Dembele and Kessie, to Paris Saint-Germain and Al Ahli respectively, are expected to net Barcelona around    65m ( £56m), while talks are also on over a 16% sale of Barca Studios which would provide another cash injection. feed Sources have confirmed to 90min that Barcelona are confident they will wrap up their outstanding deals in time to register Gundogan and the rest of their new signings before the new season gets underway. As was the case with Gavi earlier this summer when the midfielder's contract extension was delayed, Gundogan is not causing problems behind the scene and is not contemplating an early exit from Camp Nou. While Barcelona understand their current situation, sources close to the club insist they are confident they have the financial capacity to register all their new signings - a stance exemplified by ongoing efforts to sign Manchester City duo Bernardo Silva and Joao Cancelo. Gundogan and the rest of Barcelona's new signings can be registered up to and including the day of the Getafe game, and club officials are optimistic everything will be finalised in time.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Arsenal have rejected a  £30m bid from Ligue 1 side Monaco for Folarin Balogun, sources have confirmed to 90min. Balogun returned to the Gunners during the summer after a successful loan spell with Reims in which the forward managed a stunning 21 goals in Ligue 1 for the mid-table team. Despite expectations being high among Gunners fans upon his return to the Emirates, the striker barely featured during a pre-season riddled with injury concerns. Even without a dismal pre-season with Arsenal, Balogun has long been expected to leave the club once again this summer but this time permanently - the player himself stated in June that he \"definitely\" would not go out on loan again. The USMNT international has also consistently rejected the opportunity to enter talks over a new contract at the Emirates Stadium due to the lack of guarantees of game time.  90min reported in July that this resistance to signing a new deal, and unwillingness to go out on loan, has led to Arsenal slapping a  £50m price tag on the striker. feed Crystal Palace, West Ham United, Brentford, Fulham and UEFA Champions League finalists Inter have all been in contact regarding the player\\'s services, but sources have now confirmed to 90min that Monaco are the first to table an offer.  The Ligue 1 club have made an opening bid of  £30m which has been swiftly reject by the Gunners, who are holding firm on their  £50m price tag.  Monaco have stepped up their efforts to sign a new striker following Breel Embolo\\'s ACL injury during a pre-season game. The ailment will see the Swiss forward miss the bulk of the 2023/24 campaign, making the signing of a new starting calibre striker a priority for the principality club.  Along with Balogun, 90min understands that Gift Orban of Gent and reported Chelsea and West Ham target Elye Wahi have also been shortlisted by Monaco. Both forwards have recently held talks with representatives of Tottenham Hotspur.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Liverpool have agreed a British record deal worth  £111m to sign Brighton midfielder Moises Caicedo, 90min understands. The Reds opened talks with Brighton on Thursday as they pivoted from Southampton's Romeo Lavia to Caicedo and now terms are agreed between the two clubs. Caicedo had been Chelsea's prime midfield target all summer, but they baulked at the idea of meeting Brighton's value - which has always been at least  £100m - while Liverpool's offer of  £111m was immediately accepted. Such a deal would represent a British record, eclipsing the  £106m Chelsea paid to land Enzo Fernandez in January. Chelsea made numerous offers for Caicedo, but their highest did not exceed  £80m and now they have missed out on the Ecuador star who is destined for Anfield, where he will help form an overhauled midfield containing Hungarian star Dominik Szoboszlai and former Seagulls teammate Alexis Mac Allister. feed Caicedo is now due to head to Merseyside to complete his medical and is expected to sign his contract before this weekend's Premier League opener, which just so happens to come against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Sunday. For Liverpool, the deal is an obvious club record, eclipsing the  £75m paid to sign centre-back Virgil van Dijk from Southampton in January 2018. While such an expensive move was not initially on the cards this summer, Liverpool raised significant funds through the unplanned sales of Jordan Henderson and Fabinho to Saudi Arabia and ultimately decided to pull the trigger. As for Chelsea, the Blues joined the bidding for Liverpool target Lavia earlier this week as they submitted a  £48m offer for the Southampton midfielder, who has been valued at  £50m. Chelsea have also confirmed their intention to trigger the  £20m release clause of Leeds United midfielder Tyler Adams.\",\n",

The German champions have been looking to add another stopper to their ranks while Manuel Neuer continues his recovery from a broken leg that he suffered during a skiing trip back in December. They had previously looked at Brentford's David Raya, but like Tottenham Hotspur refused to match the  £40m valuation. The Bees have since agreed to sell him to Arsenal for  £30m.

Chelsea have brought in a goalkeeper of their own this transfer window, signing Robert Sanchez from Brighton for a fee in the region of  £20m. 90min understands that Bayern are also considering making a contract offer to free agent De Gea, who has been without a club since July after leaving Manchester United. De Gea also has suitors in the Saudi Pro League and it remains to be seen whether he would turn down such lucrative offers to join Bayern as a backup.

After David de Gea\\'s departure on a free transfer, United began looking for two new goalkeepers and were reported to have lined up 20-year-old Suzuki, then of Japanese side Urawa Red Diamonds, as a possible backup to new number one Andre Onana. Suzuki had other plans, however, taking his talents to Belgium and joining Sint-Truiden on loan with a view to a permanent transfer next summer. While Suzuki admitted he would love to play for United in future, he confessed that he did not want to sit on the bench behind  £47.2m signing Onana. feed \"I decided to transfer this time as a step up in aiming to be the best in the world. It\\'s true that there was an offer from Manchester United,\" Suzuki told the media. \"As a football player and as a person, if I hadn\\'t thought about anything, of course, I would like to go to Manchester United, but among them, I really want to spend time thinking about what kind of future awaits me. After much thought, I made this decision. \"Manchester United have acquired Onana. It\\'s important for me to participate in matches, and I think it is also important to play on the world stage. I want to make the most of what I have learned here and do my best.\" Despite his initial rejection, Suzuki confirmed he dreams of making the move to the Premier League and flying the flag for his country. \"While many players are active overseas, it is difficult to become a keeper,\" he concluded. \"I think we are going to have a really tough battle ahead of us in that position. \"There are still no Japanese who are active as goalkeepers in the Premier League, so I want to be one of the first players to do so.

Bayern Munich have had three bids for Kane knocked back by Spurs already this transfer window and are preparing a fourth worth  £94.6m (   110m). However, 90min understands that Tottenham have showed no indication that this will be enough to convince them to sell their star striker, who has less than a year left to run on his contract. 90min revealed on Tuesday that Kane would like his future sorted before the start of the new Premier League campaign - if he is still at Tottenham by the time they face Brentford on Sunday, he is happy to stay put for the entirety of 2023/24. Tottenham remain hopeful they can convince Kane to commit his long-term future to the club and he has been impressed by new head coach Ange Postecoglou following his appointment in June. Though Spurs are adamant that Kane will not be allowed to leave, they have brought in a new centre forward in Argentina youth international Alejo Veliz this week and could yet sign another this summer. feed Sources have told 90min that representatives of Spurs have sounded out several other strikers regarding potential moves to north London. 21-year-old Gent forward Gift Orban, who has scored a staggering 22 goals in 24 games since joining the Belgian club last year, is one target that Tottenham have spoken to. Chelsea target Elye Wahi of Montpellier and Lille star Jonathan David are also on Spurs' radar, as is wantaway Fulham talisman Aleksandar Mitrovic, who saw a proposed move to Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal fall through earlier this summer. Mitrovic was keen on a move to Saudi Arabia but Al Hilal failed to stump up more than  £30m, with Fulham demanding closer to  £50m for the Serbia international. Beyond Kane and Veliz, Brazil's starting number nine Richarlison is also on Tottenham's books and has enjoyed a fruitful pre-season under Postecoglou.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Brighton CEO Paul Barber says the club hopes to hold onto Chelsea target Moises Caicedo and \"understands\" the current interest in the Ecuador international. Caicedo has become one of the best midfielders in the Premier League during his time at the AMEX and attracted interest from both the Blues and Arsenal during the January transfer window. The midfielder asked to leave but Brighton stood firm and have maintained their not-for-sale stance during the summer so far. The youngster is said to have skipped training recently in a bid to force through a move to Stamford Bridge and wasn\\'t involved in Brighton\\'s final pre-season friendly of the summer against Rayo Vallecano. 90min understands Brighton have told Caicedo they will not sell him unless their  £100m valuation is met. Chelsea are still chasing the 21-year-old and Barber insisted the south coast side do not want him to leave this year. feed He said: \"For a young player like Moises at 21, he\\'s probably one of the best midfield players in the world already at his age, and we\\'ve had a fantastic time working with him. And we want it to continue, we\\'ve got him under a long contract. \"We\\'re also realistic to know there is interest in him. As a young man, that interest is inevitably going to have an impact on your thought process and unsettle you a little bit. We understand that. \"But for now, he\\'s a Brighton player, he\\'s under contract. We expect him to work hard, prepare for the new season and we\\'ll see what happens as the window goes on. \"The window\\'s got a long way to go, we\\'d love to keep him. He\\'s a really important player, we\\'ll see where we are.\" Brighton lost Leandro Trossard to Arsenal in January and have also sold Alexis Mac Allister and Robert Sanchez to Liverpool and Chelsea this window respectively. However, they have responded with incoming deals for Joao Pedro, Mahmoud Dahoud, James Milner, Bart Verbruggen and Igor Julio. A club-record  £34.5m deal has also been agreed with Ajax for Ghana forward Mohammed Kudus, though an agreement over personal terms still hasn\\'t been reached.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Barcelona manager Xavi has responded to rumours linking Neymar with a sensational return to Catalonia this summer.  The Brazilian superstar has been heavily linked with a move away from current club Paris Saint-Germain, with 90min recently revealing that the Ligue 1 giants are working hard to try and move the forward on.  Signed for a world record fee of  £190m (   222m) back in 2017, Neymar has largely disappointed during his time in Ligue 1 due to a myriad of injury concerns. The 31-year-old has never played more than 22 league games in any given season during his six year spell in Paris, and has failed to win the club their first ever UEFA Champions League - being on the losing end in the 2020 final.  Neymar enjoyed a much more successful stint at Barca between 2013 and 2017, winning the Champions League and two La Liga titles as an integral member of the famed \\'MSN\\' frontline.  In light of PSG\\'s interest in selling the player, Neymar has inevitably been linked with a return to his former club Barcelona. 90min understands that club president Joan Laporta is keen to re-sign Neymar, however manager Xavi would prefer if the club targeted Manchester City star Bernardo Silva.  feed Speaking to the press after Barcelona\\'s 4-2 win over Tottenham Hotspur in the Joan Gamper Trophy on Tuesday evening, Xavi was asked about the links with Neymar, saying: \"I cannot say anything more about Neymar. Last year I had mentioned a name of a player from another team and that club got angry. From here until the end of the market, we will see.\" Xavi also commented on the need for Barca to bulk their squad further this summer, telling reporters: \"We have to strengthen ourselves well. The sports area and the president know this reality. I\\'m happy with how our players are training and our pre-season.\" Barcelona are likely to face stiff competition from PIF owned Saudi Pro League clubs and potentially Newcastle United, depending on the future direction the club\\'s owners in regards to transfer policy.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Chelsea have launched a bid worth  £48m for Southampton's in-demand midfielder Romeo Lavia, sources have confirmed to 90min. The Blues are looking to bring in a couple of midfielders this month to bolster Mauricio Pochettino's options and Lavia has emerged as one of their prime targets. Chelsea are already in talks with Brighton & Hove Albion over Moises Caicedo and have seen a number of bids for him rejected, but 90min understands that, while those talks are continuing, they have now also made a move for Lavia. Chelsea have long been interested in Lavia, with their interest driven by their co-director of recruitment and talent Joe Shields - the man who took Lavia to Southampton in 2023. feed Southampton, who have agreed to sell their captain James Ward-Prowse to West Ham Untied for  £30m, are demanding  £50m for Belgian starlet Lavia and Chelsea's offer is short of that at  £48m, but it is the largest bid they have received so far this summer. Liverpool have been in pole position for Lavia, but they have seen three bids for the teenager rejected, with their latest offer for the 19-year-old being worth  £45m. Sources believe that Southampton are now more than confident that their  £50m asking price will be met by one of Lavia's suitors and they won't be accepting less.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Real Madrid are preparing to move for Sevilla goalkeeper Yassine Bounou, 90min understands, as they look to cover the long-term absence of Thibaut Courtois. The Belgian suffered an ACL injury during a training session earlier this week and will soon undergo surgery, which will keep him on the sidelines for the vast majority of the 2023/24 La Liga season. With Ukraine international Andriy Lunin the only other goalkeeper in Carlo Ancelotti's squad, Madrid are prepared to enter the transfer market for a new stopper and have identified a number of potential targets. Contact has been made with former Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea, while Chelsea's Kepa Arrizabalaga is also seen as a candidate for a loan move, but sources have confirmed to 90min that Bounou is at the top of Madrid's wish list. 32-year-old Bounou, who excelled with Morocco at the World Cup, has made 157 appearances in La Liga across his career, emerging as one of the division's most-reliable stoppers since his switch to Sevilla in 2020. feed 90min understands that Bounou has made it clear he would like the chance to move to Madrid and Sevilla are prepared to do business for a fee of around    20m ( £17.3m). Madrid were not planning to do any additional business after an expensive shopping spree which brought Jude Bellingham, Arda Guler, Fran Garcia and Joselu to the club, but Courtois' serious injury has forced them back into the market. While club officials are understood to be fans of Lunin, there is a desire to bring in a goalkeeper with more La Liga experience as Ancelotti seeks to wrestle the league title back from rivals Barcelona. Defence was a real issue for Ancelotti during pre-season, with the Spanish side conceding eight goals across four games, and the injury to Courtois has only complicated his attempted solution.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Manchester City believe they have convinced both Bernardo Silva and Kyle Walker to stay at the club and sign new contracts, sources have confirmed to 90min. Both players have been considering their futures this summer and had been looking to leave the treble-winners during the transfer window. However, after allowing Riyad Mahrez to join Ilkay Gundogan out the exit door, Man City boss Pep Guardiola and the club's hierarchy have been firm with their stance that Silva and Walker must not be sold as well. 90min revealed earlier this summer that Walker, like Mahrez, was left furious at missing out on the Champions League final and had been looking at his options to leave. A move to former club Sheffield United failed to materialise as their takeover faltered, but the most serious interest emerged from Bayern Munich. Thomas Tuchel has pushed hard to land Walker and they offered the England defender a substantial offer to make the move, but 90min understands that Guardiola has persuaded the 33-year-old to extend his stay with the club. Walker's current deal is due to expire at the end of the 2023/24 season but this will be extended to 2025 with new terms. And the news continues to be positive at Man City as their similarly firm stance on Silva looks set to pay off. feed Silva has been looking to leave the club and there have been no shortage of suitors, with Barcelona pushing hard to sign a player who had long been eyeing a move to Catalonia. PSG were ready to pay Man City their asking price of around  £80m this summer, but Silva has been told he will not be allowed to leave. While Silva is keen to move on from Man City and has recently reiterated that desire to Guardiola, sources have told 90min that he is accepting there is little chance of any club being able to persuade them to sell. Silva's current deal runs to 2025, which means Man City are not under pressure to sanction a transfer, and because of that a new contract is now close to being finalised. As 90min previously revealed, Man City are willing to make Silva one of the best-paid players at the club and in the Premier League altogether, putting him close to the wage packets of teammates Erling Haaland and Kevin De Bruyne. Man City believe and hope that both Silva and Walker will put pen-to-paper on their new deals by the end of this month.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Manchester United are set to enter the transfer market to sign a new centre-back following the completion of Harry Maguire's  £30m move to West Ham, 90min understands. Maguire is in discussions over a move to east London after being made available for transfer this summer by Erik ten Hag, who has already stripped the 30-year-old of the United captaincy. Maguire had initially wanted to stay and fight for his place but is now likely to proceed with his Old Trafford departure after talks between the clubs progressed this week. The England international arrived in 2019 for  £80m, a world record transfer fee for a defender, but has suffered a difficult four years under successive managers Ten Hag, Ralf Rangnick and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. He has lost his place entirely in the team under the Dutchman, who has not deemed Maguire suitable to execute the style of football he'd like to implement in Manchester. It had been part of Ten Hag's long-term plan to phase out and replace Maguire, despite his public suggestions otherwise, and now his departure is nearing completion, United are exploring names to replace his position in the squad. They have been offered Benjamin Pavard, a French World Cup winner who has been looking to leave Bayern Munich for the duration of the summer. He would carry the added bonus of being able to cover at right-back should he swap southern Germany for north west England. Bayern are open to letting Pavard leave and he'd likely cost United in the region of what they'd receive for Maguire. feed Nice centre-back Jean-Clair Todibo is a younger alternative at a similar price under consideration, while Liverpool target Perr Schuurs, now of Torino but formerly of Ten Hag's Ajax, is also liked behind the scenes. Everton's Jarrad Branthwaite is another central defender United have been following. Edmond Tapsoba, a Tottenham target who plays for Bayer Leverkusen, represents a more expensive option if United choose to go down that route, though it remains to be seen at present how much they are prepared to outlay and how ambitious they'd like to be with their replacement. Benfica's Antonio Silva is understood to be loved by club scouts but potentially the most expensive of those named. The club are looking to raise funds through the sales of a number of squad players - not just that of Maguire - and are close to moving Fred out of Old Trafford, with several parties interested in the Brazilian. Donny van de Beek is also set to depart for Real Sociedad in the coming weeks, with United pushing for a permanent deal, while Scott McTominay is still of interest to West Ham, who are now threatened by interest from Manchester City in Lucas Paqueta.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Jurgen Klopp is never shy in expressing his vehement distaste for numerous aspects of modern football\\'s calendar. Whether it\\'s Saturday lunchtime kick-offs or England\\'s festive fixture list, the Liverpool manager is quick to voice his criticism. The latest scheduling conflict to irk Klopp has been the closing date of the Saudi Pro League\\'s summer transfer window. \"I think pretty much the worst thing is that the transfer window in Saudi Arabia is three weeks longer open,\" Klopp argued ahead of the new Premier League season. \"That\\'s not helpful. So there must be, UEFA, FIFA must find solutions for that.\" Klopp knows the power that the Pro League wields better than most after watching two of his starting midfielders Jordan Henderson and Fabinho move to the Middle East this summer. Here\\'s exactly when the Saudi Pro League transfer window closes and how it compares to its European counterparts. Much like most European divisions and northern hemisphere leagues in general, the Saudi Pro League transfer window began on 1 July. Before the window had even officially opened, Saudi clubs had begun to reshape the transfer market with the earth-shattering arrival of Karim Benzema at top-flight champions Al Ittihad. While Cristiano Ronaldo\\'s move to Al Nassr last December was ground-breaking, the acquisition of the reigning Ballon d\\'Or winner was a statement move. There is still plenty of time for many more. The Saudi Arabian sports ministry has put aside around $800m ( £628m) for transfers to the top flight this summer, per the New York Times. The newly expanded 18-team league has until 20 September to splurge this hulking mass of capital. According to the detailed report in the New York Times, Saudi clubs were each provided with numerous transfer recommendations at the start of the window alongside a set of ground rules to prevent inter-league competition for players. During the seismic off-season, Saudi clubs have spent around  £350m to recruit the likes of Benzema, former Manchester City winger Riyad Mahrez and Sadio Mane from Bayern Munich. No team among Europe\\'s supposed elite has proven capable of matching the financial might from the Middle East. The Saudi Pro League\\'s chief operating officer Carlo Nohra explained to Reuters: \"We had to improve quality and in order to improve quality, you have to bring in the best. Spending was always going to be an essential component for us to do this.\" manual Klopp\\'s outburst was underpinned by the disparity between the closing dates of the transfer windows in England and Saudi Arabia. While the Pro League can continue to tempt players away with lucrative deals until the fourth week of September, the Premier League\\'s transfer window slams (it never closes quietly) shut on 1 September at 23:00 BST. When both windows are open, Premier League clubs can at least source replacements for the individuals that chased gold to the Gulf. Yet, there are 19 long days for Saudi sides to pilfer England\\'s helpless top flight. According to FIFA\\'s Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players, transfer windows are determined by each association. World football\\'s governing body stipulates that there must be two registration periods (summer and winter windows) and the first \"shall begin on the first day of the season. This period may not exceed 12 weeks.\" The 2023/24 season begins on 1 July 2023 for most leagues which run from autumn to spring. Therefore, the latest that the summer window could close would be on 23 September 2023. The Saudi Pro League have simply stretched the window to its limits while the Premier League plays by the same rules as the rest of Europe. League Closing date / time (BST) La Liga 01/09/2023 - 23:00 Serie A 01/09/2023 - 19:00 Bundesliga 01/09/2023 - 17:00 Ligue 1 01/09/2023 - 22:00 This year, all of the major European leagues will also close at varying times on 1 September. The Premier League voted to close their summer window in 2018 and 2019 when the season\\'s fixtures began during August, theoretically providing every manager with a settled squad for each match in the first half of the campaign. However, the rest of Europe didn\\'t follow suit, giving those on the continent ample opportunity to poach Premier League stars without any chance of retaliation. After two years, Premier League clubs voted to get back \"in sync\" with the rest of Europe. Now, the continent\\'s elite teams are out of step with the Saudi Pro League - which has already spent more on transfers than La Liga. Whether this will lead to an extension of future summer windows remains to be seen. But there will be no solution for a grumpy Klopp this year.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Tottenham Hotspur head coach Ange Postecoglou has admitted that Harry Kane was \\'unlikely\\' to stay at the club this season ahead of his move to Bayern Munich. 90min reported on Thursday that Spurs had finally relented and accepted an  £86.4m (   100m) bid from the German champions. Kane will fly to Germany on Friday to finalise the transfer. Spurs boss Postecoglou insisted last week that he simply wanted the saga resolved as soon as possible to plan for the season ahead. Ahead of Sunday\\'s trip to Brentford for his Premier League debut, Postecoglou was understandably asked for an update on Kane. \"It\\'s fair to say I don\\'t have a blow by blow account of the whole thing but fair to say it\\'s progressed to the point where it looks like it\\'s going to happen. We move forward without Harry. It gives us clarity and unless something unforeseen happens we\\'ll move on,\" he said. \"I didn\\'t see the point in [pitching myself] because whatever I was going to say was going to be irrelevant. I could plan his grand vision but I\\'m sure he\\'d heard it all before. My feeling was we\\'ll get to know each other, that\\'s the best way to navigate this early bit. Having said that, in my mind after that initial conversation [on the first day], he\\'d made up his mind that if the clubs agreed he\\'d go but he was also happy to stay if they didn\\'t. \"It\\'s best Harry speaks for himself on the decision but there\\'s no doubts he\\'s one of the greats of this football club. His record speaks for himself. I\\'m only new in the building but I\\'m certainly not the spokesman for this football club in declaring people\\'s status but I think it\\'s clear Harry Kane is one of the greats. \"I think if you\\'re involved in football as long as I have, you know clubs are not going to talk to each other without the player knowing. We weren\\'t talking to Wolfsburg without knowing Micky van de Ven wanted to come. \"[Harry and I] had a chat on the first day. He was up front and honest that if they could agree a deal then he would go. He wanted it decided by the first game and that was my preference as well.\" manual When asked how Tottenham will go about replacing Kane, Postecoglou added: \"I don\\'t think there\\'s a like for like replacement for Harry. We\\'ve been planning for this for a while to be fair. It doesn\\'t take too much investigative work to know that this was going to happen. Our business up to now reflects that. \"I don\\'t think it works that way [giving Daniel Levy a list of strikers to get]. It\\'s not like the family shopping list to go and get milk and bread for the kids. My whole strategy has been that Harry was unlikely to be around so it wasn\\'t like we had a pow wow this morning.\" 90min revealed earlier this week that Spurs representatives had touched base with other forwards, including Gent starlet Gift Orban.',\n",

Ahead of West Ham\\'s Premier League season opener away to Bournemouth, Moyes was asked for the latest on the saga. \"We\\'ve had a bid accepted from Manchester United, but while he\\'s not our player I\\'m not in a position to discuss him,\" he replied. feed While Maguire has not officially left the club yet, 90min understands Man Utd are stepping up plans to bring in a replacement centre-back. Bayern Munich\\'s Benjamin Pavard has been offered to the Red Devils and has made it clear in recent months that he wants to continue his playing career at centre-back as opposed to right-back. Nice\\'s Jean-Clair Todibo, Everton\\'s Jarrad Branthwaite, Torino\\'s Perr Schuurs and Bayer Leverkusen\\'s Edmond Tapsoba are all on Man Utd\\'s shortlist. Maguire was stripped of the club captaincy this summer and removed entirely from Man Utd\\'s leadership group, with Bruno Fernandes being promoted to skipper. West Ham, meanwhile, have finally made some movement in the transfer market after a quiet summer window. They recently completed the signing of Ajax midfielder Edson Alvarez, with Southampton captain James Ward-Prowse set to follow.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp admits his previous comments on heavy spending were wrong  in the wake of the Reds\\'  £111m agreement to sign Moises Caicedo from Brighton. Caicedo is set to become the most expensive signing in the history of English football after Liverpool agreed to pay Brighton  £111m to sign the midfielder, but critics were quick to recall Klopp\\'s previous criticisms of such heavy spending. Indeed, in 2016, Klopp was left stunned by Manchester United\\'s  £89m acquisition of Paul Pogba - a world record at the time - and vowed he would never pull the trigger on such a deal. \"The day that this is football, I\\'m not in a job anymore, because the game is about playing together,\" Klopp said at the time. \"Other clubs can go out and spend more money and collect top players. I want to do it differently. I would even do it differently if I could spend that money.\" feed Having now agreed to sign Caicedo for  £111m in the same summer as Dominik Szoboszlai and Alexis Mac Allister moved to Liverpool for a combined  £95m, Klopp confessed the market has been thrown into turmoil since his comments on Pogba. \"Everything changed,\" he told a press conference on Friday. \"Do I like it? No, but did I realise I was wrong? Definitely. Definitely. That\\'s the way it goes. It\\'s not great, it\\'s not top. Saudi Arabia will not help with that. I\\'m not blaming it, but another market with a lot of money. \"In the end, we as a club, we have to try make sure that we, with our resources, get the best possible team together. We try everything to bring together the best squad for us, and we are not in dreamland, so it\\'s not like we can just point at players and bring them in. \"If people want to throw my quotes from five or six years ago at me, no problem. That\\'s what I thought that day, and I realise now I was wrong, easy to admit that.\"',\n",

       "  'text': \"West Ham United have agreed a  £30m deal with Southampton for their captain James Ward-Prowse, sources have confirmed to 90min. The Hammers have been desperately trying to strengthen their squad after selling Declan Rice to Arsenal in a British-record  £105m transfer. Things have been slow moving for West Ham, amid internal conflicts between manager David Moyes and new technical director Tim Steidten, but progress has been made over the past 48 hours on a number of targets. Edson Alvarez has completed a medical in London ahead of a  £34m move from Ajax, while West Ham have also agreed a  £30m fee for former Manchester United skipper Harry Maguire - he is now due to discuss personal terms over a move to the East End. And sources have confirmed to 90min that after lengthy negotiations, West Ham have agreed a  £30m deal with Southampton for Ward-Prowse, with an additional sell-on clause, having seen a bid for the same amount rejected by United for Scott McTominay. feed It had looked as though West Ham's move for central midfielder Ward-Prowse would fall through, with Southampton wanting more money for the 28-year-old, but terms have now been agreed between the two parties ahead of the opening weekend of the Premier League season. It's expected he will sign a four-year contract should he come through a medical unscathed. Ward-Prowse has been at Southampton for the entirety of his career, making 422 appearances on the south coast and scoring 55 goals. He has also provided 55 assists in that time, while his unerring accuracy from free-kicks has drawn comparisons to David Beckham. West Ham hope to complete deals for half a dozen players before the summer window closes, with attention now set to turn to strengthening in the wide forward areas and with a striker.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Chelsea are refusing to give up their pursuit of Brighton midfielder Moises Caicedo, 90min understands, despite seeing Liverpool agree a fee for the Ecuador international. The Blues failed with an  £80m offer and were considering returning with a bid closer to Brighton's  £100m asking price when Liverpool swooped in and agreed a British record deal worth  £111m to sign the 21-year-old. Nothing has been signed between Brighton and Liverpool, however, and sources have confirmed to 90min that Chelsea are refusing to accept defeat in the race. Chelsea have informed Caicedo's representatives that they are prepared to battle to try and sign the midfielder and will not give up hope until he has put pen to paper on a deal with Liverpool. As it stands, Chelsea have not made a new bid for Caicedo, with Liverpool the only side to have seen an offer accepted. Before Liverpool's offer arrived, 90min understood that Caicedo's preference was to join Chelsea this summer, with the midfielder repeatedly making it clear to Brighton that he wanted to be allowed to speak to the Blues. feed Caicedo has not yet travelled to Merseyside for a scheduled medical, 90min further understands, and Chelsea are using the time to try and work on a solution. Brighton are hoping to sell Caicedo to the highest bidder and wasted little time in accepting Liverpool's offer, which was significantly higher than any proposal put forward until now by Chelsea. The two clubs, who ironically meet in their opening Premier League fixture on Sunday, have also butted heads  over Southampton midfielder Romeo Lavia. The Reds failed with three bids for the Belgian, the last of which was worth  £46m, before Chelsea arrived with an offer of  £48m. Southampton value Lavia at  £50m and are not prepared to compromise on their price. Where Caicedo ends up remains to be seen, but the twists and turns of the transfer have made it one of the most fascinating sagas of what's been an extraordinary window to date.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Manchester United have agreed to sell Harry Maguire to West Ham United for a  £30m fee, sources have confirmed to 90min. The England international was removed from his position as club captain last month, with Bruno Fernandes taking over the role at Old Trafford. 90min revealed on Monday that West Ham had made a  £30m bid for Maguire with his long-term future at United uncertain, but the bid was turned down at the time. Part of the reason why United knocked back this offer was the belief that the Hammers would be unable to satisfy Maguire's wage demands, but after West Ham informed the Red Devils on Wednesday their willingness to amend their contract offer to the centre-back, the two clubs have come to an agreement. Though Maguire has not been 100% convinced of leaving Man Utd this transfer window, 90min understands he is open to a move and it looks likely that he will now accept West Ham's offer. feed Should Maguire complete a move to London Stadium, United will make a  £50m loss on the 30-year-old following his world-record move from Leicester City in 2019 which made him the most expensive defender in football history. Maguire fell out of favour under Erik ten Hag last season, with Lisandro Martinez displacing him from the starting lineup and often featuring alongside Raphael Varane. Victor Lindelof has also usurped Maguire in the pecking order, with Luke Shaw also preferred in a central role at times. West Ham remain interested in Man Utd midfielder Scott McTominay, who was also the subject of a  £30m bid this week, but the Red Devils are continuing to hold out for a higher fee for the Scotland international. Ajax's Edson Alvarez is close to finalising a move to east London, - he's undergone a medical and is set to pen a five-year deal - while West Ham have also agreed to pay Southampton  £30m for their captain James Ward-Prowse - a move that may prevent an improved offer being made for McTominay.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Liverpool have held talks over potentially trumping Chelsea's latest offer for Brighton midfielder Moises Caicedo, 90min understands. Chelsea have seen multiple bids for Caicedo rejected already this summer, with Brighton holding out for  £100m. While talks between the two sides remain on, Chelsea have also stepped up their pursuit of potential alternatives. Indeed, a bid was recently lodged for Southampton midfielder Romeo Lavia - the subject of three failed offers from Liverpool. With Chelsea threatening to hijack the pursuit of Lavia, sources have confirmed to 90min that Liverpool have made a late move over potentially beating Mauricio Pochettino's side to Caicedo. Sources have stressed that Liverpool have not yet submitted a formal offer for Caicedo but have held talks with Brighton as they explore a possible move to exceed Chelsea's  £80m proposal. feed 90min understands that Caicedo's preference would be to join Chelsea over Liverpool, but it remains to be seen whether that stance would change if the Reds see an offer accepted. Chelsea sources insist that the Blues remain well in the fight for Caicedo as well as Lavia, with Leeds United's Tyler Adams another target on the table. Liverpool are desperate to continue bolstering their midfield after the surprise departures of Jordan Henderson and Fabinho to Saudi Arabia, and Jurgen Klopp's side have spent a large part of the summer focused on Lavia. Three bids have been knocked back by Southampton, the latest of which was worth around  £46m, and Chelsea have moved to try and win the race for Lavia with an offer of  £48m -  £2m short of the Saints'  £50m asking price.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"West Ham United do not intend to sell Lucas Paqueta despite Manchester City making a verbal offer of  £70m for the Brazilian, sources have confirmed to 90min. The 25-year-old established himself as a key player in David Moyes' side during the second half of last season, helping the club to a famous win over Fiorentina in the Europa Conference League final. But despite that success, and West Ham's subsequent qualification for the Europa League, Paqueta wasn't overly impressed with how the 2022/23 season went, with 90min exclusively revealing in June that the Brazilian has particular concerns about working under Moyes. Paqueta has had to adapt his style of play to fit into Moyes' system, and although his performance levels significantly improved after the winter World Cup in Qatar, it's clear that the Brazilian's natural instincts are compromised by West Ham sitting deep and looking to hit teams on the counter. The former AC Milan and Lyon midfielder parted company with his long-term agents earlier this summer, and it's understood his new representation have been assessing potential landing spots for Paqueta during the current transfer window.  Paris Saint-Germain showed interest in Paqueta earlier this summer and retain an interest in his services, while the recently appointed director of the Saudi Pro League, Michael Emenalo, is keeping apprised of the midfielder's situation at West Ham. 90min has also learned of significant interest from Premier League champions Manchester City, who have made a verbal offer of  £70m for Paqueta. West Ham have turned that bid down and have insisted that they do not intend to sell Paqueta, however sources have told 90min that an offer 'too good to turn down' would be considered. feed Whether or not City return for Paqueta remains to be seen, but they certainly have the financial capability to offer West Ham an increased figure - the money at their disposal evidenced by their  £90m bid for Declan Rice earlier this summer. It's also rare for City to engage in talks unless they have a genuine belief of signing a player. City's interest stems from their desire to replace Ilkay Gundogan and Riyad Mahrez, who have left for Barcelona and Al Ahli respectively, but isn't believed to be connected to a potential sale of Bernardo Silva. 90min recently revealed that Barcelona have made fresh contact with Silva in an attempt to prise the Portuguese international away from City, but they have no intention to sell at this point. Paris Saint-Germain are also interested in the 28-year-old. 90min further understands that Newcastle's long-term interest in Paqueta has not waned, but a deal may be difficult for them to do because of Financial Fair Play regulations. A loan with obligation to buy  appears to be the only way the Magpies could facilitate a move this summer, though that is unlikely to happen at this stage.\",\n",

Nevertheless, 90min understands Arsenal are not planning on parting ways with Jorginho this summer, although the Italian is among a group of players for whom sizeable offers would be entertained. Speaking to Tuttomercatoweb, agent Joao Santos confirmed that Jorginho expects to end the summer with Arsenal. \"Jorginho is focused, he is thinking about Saturday and playing his sixth year in the Premier League as well as his fifth in the Champions League,\" he said. \"And above all, he is focused on the national team.\" feed Santos went on to confess he had received interest from clubs across the globe but reiterated the plan to keep Jorginho at Arsenal. \"He will stay at Arsenal,\" the agent said. \"He is happy to be in England. \"Some enquiries, for example from Saudi Arabia. Someone called me, but nothing concrete. Jorginho is also appreciated in Spain, he\\'s an important player. But he will stay at Arsenal.\" Declan Rice\\'s summer switch to Arsenal has increased the competition for minutes at the base of the Gunners\\' midfield, where Thomas Partey also remains after a potential move to Saudi Arabia ultimately failed to materialise.

       "  'text': 'Carlo Ancelotti has insisted Real Madrid have total faith in Ukraine international Andriy Lunin as they consider their goalkeeping options in the wake of Thibaut Courtois\\' injury. Courtois is set to undergo surgery after tearing his ACL in training and is subsequently expected to miss the vast majority of the upcoming campaign, leaving Madrid with Lunin as their only senior goalkeeper. As 90min reported following Courtois\\' injury, Madrid have not yet ruled out keeping Lunin as their starting goalkeeper, although club officials are drawing up a list of potential targets as they seek to bolster in the position once again. After contact was made with free agent David de Gea, Madrid focused their efforts on Sevilla stopper Yassine Bounou, who is keen to make the move this summer. However, with Lunin set to start the campaign in goal as Madrid open their season against Athletic Club on Saturday, Ancelotti reiterated his faith in the 24-year-old. feed \"Emotionally, it was not a good day,\" Ancelotti told a press conference. \"We are sad on a personal level as it is an injury to an important player, but these things happen in football. \"We wish [Courtois] a speedy recovery and we give all the confidence in the world to Lunin, who is a great goalkeeper. In pre-season, he did well. Total confidence in him, we think he is a talent. What he lacks is what everyone lacks, experience, but he will take it game by game.\" Asked whether he would like a new signing, Ancelotti responded: \"We have time until 31 August. Behind Lunin, our goalkeepers have potential, but they are young. We will think about it. Fran [Gonzalez] is 17 years old. \"If we sign a new goalkeeper, we will do it for numbers because we have confidence in Lunin. The confidence in Lunin is total.\" Ancelotti ended with a simple assessment of the sort of goalkeeper he would like to see Madrid bring in.    One that stops the ball with his hands,\" the Italian quipped. \"First and foremost, one that makes saves. That is what I ask of all goalkeepers. Let them be good with their hands. When it comes to feet, it\\'s better to have a striker.\"',\n",

       "  'text': \"Harry Kane has not yet accepted Bayern Munich's offer of a summer transfer, 90min understands, with Tottenham Hotspur hopeful their talisman will instead agree to stay. Having seen Kane enter the final year of his contract, Spurs have begrudgingly accepted a bid from Bayern worth    100m ( £86.4m) but have long been determined to convince the England international to reject their advances and stay. While Bayern were confident an agreement with Spurs was all that was missing in their pursuit of Kane, sources have confirmed to 90min that the 30-year-old has not yet given his approval to a move to Munich. Kane is understood to be considering his options, one of which is to remain with Spurs beyond this summer, and sources close to the club are now hopeful that Kane will agree to remain at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium for at least one more season. The striker informed both Spurs and Bayern earlier this week that he wanted his future resolved by the time the new Premier League season kicks off this weekend, with Spurs due to play Brentford on Sunday. feed Bayern themselves wanted a deal wrapped up when they lodged a third bid which was also worth    100m, but based around a less-favourable payment structure for the Premier League side. But they did not get the immediate response they were hoping for as Spurs chairman Daniel Levy delayed his eventual rejection. They have now seen a bid accepted which would satisfy Kane's deadline but the striker has not yet given the green light - a hesitance which has left Spurs optimistic about their chances of keeping the striker. Should Kane stay, he would be able to discuss a free transfer overseas in January, with Spurs at risk of losing him for free next summer, when Premier League rivals would also be able to offer a contract. Spurs have long been determined to keep Kane and have never given up on convincing the England captain to sign a new contract further down the line.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"West Ham United have contacted Montpellier over striker Elye Wahi and are weighing up an offer, 90min understands. The Hammers confirmed their first major signing of the summer on Thursday, committing Edson Alvarez to a five-year contract after agreeing to pay Ajax up to  £34m for his services.  £30m deals are also in place for Southampton captain James Ward-Prowse and Manchester United defender Harry Maguire, while West Ham also have eyes on signing a new striker, wide forward and left back before the window closes on September 1     the club have money to spend after selling Declan Rice to Arsenal for a British-record fee of  £105m. 90min previously revealed that West Ham had shown an interest in 20-year-old Wahi, who bagged 19 goals for Montpellier in Ligue 1, amid concerns that Saudi Pro League side Al Ettifaq, managed by Steven Gerrard, may try to prise Michail Antonio away from London Stadium. That move hasn't come to fruition but Gianluca Scamacca has departed West Ham, joining Atalanta on a permanent basis. His exit has left the club a little light up front, with Antonio, Danny Ings and academy striker Divin Mubama the options at David Moyes' disposal. Sources have now confirmed to 90min that West Ham have made contact with Montpellier over Wahi - a player admired by technical director Tim Steidten - with a view to making an offer for the France Under-21 international. feed But getting a deal over the line won't be easy. Wahi has generated considerable interest this summer, with Arsenal and Chelsea among his Premier League suitors - the latter have been made a verbal offer. Ligue 1 giants Monaco are also considering a bid, though crucially they can't offer European football this season like West Ham can, and Eintracht Frankfurt think Wahi could be the ideal fit to replace Randal Kolo Muani. Kolo Muani has been strongly linked with Paris Saint-Germain and Bayern Munich this summer, as well as Manchester United, and 90min understands that West Ham have enquired about his potential price tag too - PSG are leading the charge though as they cast Kylian Mbappe to one side in a furious dispute over his future, and it looks increasingly likely that Kolo Muani will return to Ligue 1 if a fee can be agreed. Montpellier are expected to demand a fee of at least  £35m for Wahi, though they still may look to keep him after renewing his contract just six months ago. West Ham's other major piece of business surrounds the interest from Premier League champions Manchester City in Lucas Paqueta. A verbal  £70m offer was swiftly rejected by the Hammers, who don't want to sell the Brazilian, but it's expected that the treble winners will imminently return with an improved bid.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Real Madrid are now in the market for a new goalkeeper after Thibaut Courtois suffered a potential season-ending injury this week.  The Belgian shot-stopper suffered an ACL injury which will unfortunately require surgery and an extremely lengthy spell on the sidelines.  In the imemdiate term Andriy Lunin will stand in. But here's the options available to Madrid in what remains of this summer transfer window in order to replace the stricken Courtois... feed Diogo Costa is the best goalkeeper on this list. That is a fact. The Porto star is an archtypal modern goalie who is as equally with the ball at his feet as he is in between the sticks. So why is he the last on these options, you ask? Well the fact that he has a  £65m (   75m) release clause in his contract - something which we highly doubt Real Madrid would pay. Likelihood: 1/10 The 22-year-old has been consistently linked with a move away from Valencia in recent months, so it only makes sense to add him to list of potential Courtois deputies. The  £25m asking price that Valencia have put on the goalkeeper makes any move unlikely however, especially when there's much, much cheaper options who would do as good a job currently on the market. Likelihood: 2/10  Recently linked with a move to Bayern, regular Premier League viewers are well aware of Kepa Arrizabalaga's deficiencies. He's not all bad though, and if Chelsea are desperate to get ride of him this summer then he could be available for an okay price.Kepa was actually heavily linked with Madrid once before, way back in 2018.Likelihood: 4/10  Even before the news broke that Thibaut Courtois was set to miss the majority of the season, David Soria was being linked with a move to the Santiago Bernabeu. A deal was reported to have fallen through in July due to a mixture of Getafe wanting  £8m for his services and Soria not being keen on becoming a second choice goalkeeper. With the opportunity to become Madrid's first-choice shot-stopper for a season now available, Soria may be more keen to join the club. Likelihood: 6/10  Three UEFA Champions Leagues, one La Liga and four FIFA Club World Cups. It's fair to say that Keylor Navas enjoyed his previous stint at Real Madrid. His success at the club in the mid-2010s, coupled with his availability due to lowly position in the PSG goalkeeper ranks means this deal would make a lot of sense. Likelihood: 8/10  Once upon a time, David de Gea was a fax machine away from joining Real Madrid for around  £30m.Now, Madrid can sign the goalkeeper as a free agent and not have worry about paying a fee or rely on a fax machine to work properly. He's the logical choice. Likelihood: 10/10\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Harry Kane is set to leave Tottenham Hotspur this summer after agreeing to join German champions Bayern Munich, 90min understands. Bayern lodged four bids for the England striker, eventually agreeing to a    100m ( £86.4m) deal to lure Kane away, but the striker himself did not immediately give his approval to a move as he considered all his options. While the initial delay left Spurs feeling hopeful they may have convinced their captain to stay, 90min understands that Kane has now accepted Bayern's proposal and is set to leave the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium this summer. Kane, who set a deadline of Sunday to resolve his future, is due in Germany on Friday to undergo a medical ahead of signing a four-year contract with the Bundesliga champions. However, Spurs have currently delayed signing off on the deal and are keen to finalise each and every minor detail before allowing Kane to depart. Bayern are hopeful that Kane will be in attendance for Saturday's Super Cup clash with RB Leipzig, perhaps even playing a role in the match if all goes to plan. feed The move to Germany, if sealed as expected, will bring an end to Kane's 19-year association with Tottenham, in which he has racked up 280 goals in 435 appearances. Kane's pursuit of Alan Shearer's all-time Premier League top scorer record will also be halted, perhaps permanently. The 30-year-old has struck 213 times in the competition, 47 fewer than Blackburn and Newcastle icon Shearer. While they had been hopeful of keeping Kane, Spurs have been exploring potential replacements for the England captain in anticipation of a departure. Argentina youth international Alejo Veliz has agreed to join but Spurs are also looking at the likes of Gent's Gift Orban, Montpellier's Elye Wahi and Lille's Jonathan David. Aleksandar Mitrovic of Fulham is also on Spurs' radar. The Serb was keen to leave for Saudi Arabia earlier this summer but has seen a move blocked by Fulham, who are demanding  £50m to part ways with their star striker.\",\n",

Alvarez has emerged as one of West Ham's top targets this summer, and is the choice of recently appointed technical director Tim Steidten. Steidten and manager David Moyes have been struggling to agree on targets throughout the summer. That has now seen West Ham switch focus to Alvarez after failing to seal deals for Southampton's James Ward-Prowse and Manchester United's Scott McTominay. West Ham, despite the record sale of Declan Rice, have yet to make a breakthrough in the transfer market and that plight was highlighted at the weekend as they were hammered 4-0 by Bayer Leverkusen - ironically Steidten's former club. He has now pushed ahead with a move for Alvarez in an attempt to get something done before the start of the Premier League season next weekend. feed Now, West Ham have made an initial offer  £25.9m for Alvarez. Although that isn't considered enough by Ajax, who are seeking just over  £30m, talks have continued and are at an advanced stage. Alvarez was a target for Chelsea last year and almost joined Borussia Dortmund earlier this summer, before that deal fell through to give West Ham the opportunity to try and land him. 90min understands the Hammers are looking to bring in up to six players before the summer window closes and getting the Alvarez deal over the line is seen as a key breakthrough in the transfer market.\",\n",

West Ham saw an opening offer for former captain Maguire worth  £20m rebuffed last month before a more recent second proposal of  £30m was also dismissed by United. The Hammers also firmed up their interest in another United star in the shape of Scottish midfielder McTominay but, like with Maguire, the Red Devils were not willing to do business at the  £30m mark. 90min understands the actual offers were not too far away from United's valuation, but the overall deals including the wages West Ham could afford or were willing to provide were not sufficient enough to tempt the Old Trafford giants into selling either player. United, who themselves have spent more than  £100m this summer on Andre Onana, Mason Mount and Rasmus Hojlund, are anxious to move players on to finance other deals and Erik ten Hag has sanctioned the departures of both Maguire and McTominay.  However, neither player is desperate to move. feed Maguire remains unconvinced that his future is best served away from the club despite having the captaincy stripped, while McTominay also believes he could yet play his way into Ten Hag's plans given fellow midfielders Donny van de Beek and Fred are expected to move this summer.  West Ham - who are the only team to make firm offers for either Maguire or McTominay this summer - are now considering improved bids for the two players. They are also looking to complete the signing of Ajax midfielder Edson Alvarez in the coming days.\",\n",

(Defensa Central) Chelsea and Manchester City are both ready to step up their pursuits of Crystal Palace winger Michael Olise. (Mirror) There is also interest from Chelsea in PSG midfielder Leandro Paredes, who is seen as a potential alternative to Moises Caicedo. (Evening Standard) Manchester United's attempts to sign Fiorentina midfielder Sofyan Amrabat have been complicated by interest from Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool. (Independent) Everton have now moved to the front of the queue for Man Utd centre-back Harry Maguire ahead of both Tottenham and West Ham. (Football Insider) With concerns over Andy Robertson's suitability for his new role, Liverpool are still looking to sign a new left-sided centre-back this summer. (Liverpool Echo) manual PSG offered Neymar to Barcelona as part of their pursuit of Ousmane Dembele but Barca boss Xavi rejected the reunion. (Sport) To replace Dembele, Barcelona are expected to step up their pursuit of Manchester City midfielder Bernardo Silva, who expects to be allowed to leave for the right price. (Mundo Deportivo) Barcelona are also set to meet with the agent of Alexis Sanchez, who is available on a free transfer and could be brought back for a second spell at Camp Nou. (Jose Tomas Fernandez) Clement Lenglet is resisting Barcelona's attempts to sell him to Al Nassr as he wants to return to Tottenham. (Sport) Lenglet could be brought in as a replacement for both Joe Rodon and Davinson Sanchez, who have been told they are free to leave Tottenham this summer. (Evening Standard) Willian has agreed personal terms with Saudi side Al Shabab just days after signing a new contract with Fulham and now wants to leave Craven Cottage. (Fabrizio Romano)\",\n",
