Chelsea midfielder Jorginho has been linked with a move to Barcelona, but his agent says the priority is for the player to sign a new contract at Stamford Bridge. The Italy midfielder's current deal expires at the end of this season and it has been uncertain as to whether he'll remain at in west London beyond that. With Sergio Busquets likely to leave Barcelona for an MLS twilight, there has been reported interest from the Catalans in Jorginho as a replacement. Those rumours were only fuelled further when agent Joao Santos was spotted in the Spanish city. However, Santos says the Italian very much wants to remain at Chelsea, having arrived in 2018. "We are due in June," he told tuttomercatoweb.com. "We prioritise Chelsea and we are moving towards it. Another priority for Jorginho is to do well with the national team." When asked about why he was visiting Barcelona, the agent said it wasn't purely to discuss Jorginho joining Xavi's side, but didn't deny talking about that while there. "I work in football," he said. "I have been to Barcelona, Madrid and Valencia but also in other parts such as Lyon. It's work. I'm Jorginho's agent, I may have talked about him but also about others."
