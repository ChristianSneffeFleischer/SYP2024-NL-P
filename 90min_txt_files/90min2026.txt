Cesar Montes officially joined Espanyol de Barcelona from Rayados de Monterrey.   The defender longed for a move away from Liga MX, previously negotiating with Russian team Dinamo Moscow before the deal fell through in the Summer. But he finally secured a transfer, joining the La Liga team for an estimated $7m.   "They have given me confidence and I have to reciprocate it. I'm here now because it's the right time in my career after a World Cup and that's why it's happening now," explained Montes.      I   m happy and excited, this is a dream come true for me. It   s worth the sacrifice because I   m here now and everything is going to be exciting from now on. I   m not afraid of playing in Europe, it   s a challenge and it   s what I have wanted to do since I was a boy. I come to compete for a place in the side and we will know how the coach responds towards me.    Montes departed Rayados after seven years with the club, where he managed 13 goals in 265 Liga MX appearances since his debut in 2015. The defender also inspired Rayados to a Liga MX title and the 2019/2020 Copa MX, along with many playoff appearances.
