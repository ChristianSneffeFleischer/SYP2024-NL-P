The scriptwriters at Gazprom Headquarters are really spoiling us with all of these amazing Champions League narratives - but none have been more compelling than the complete meltdown of Futbol Club Barcelona. Barcelona didn't need a tonking in front of a global audience in order to undertake a complete club overhaul, but it was nice of them to oblige. And while a lot of their problems run deep at the club, the board have put the entirety of the senior squad bar four players (Lionel Messi, Marc-Andr   ter Stegen, Cl  ment Lenglet and Frenkie de Jong) up for sale, according to Sport. In fairness to the guys upstairs at Camp Nou, we've all done the same after a big defeat on Football Manager, and Barcelona fans need to understand that this is a great decision in search of comedy in this sport. So where could all of La Blaugrana's players go? Why would teams buy them after such a humiliating showing? Can they run ten miles to the gallon? Like a used car salesman working out of Alabama, slapping the hood of the shoddy second-hand vehicle he's desperately trying to sell, let's look at how Bar  a could offload their stock.
