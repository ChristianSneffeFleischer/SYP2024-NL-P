Arsenal flop Henrikh Mkhitaryan says he wants to secure a permanent deal with Serie A side Roma following his loan spell at the club. The Armenian playmaker has managed to revive his career in Italy after a torrid time in the Premier League, having joined Manchester United from Borussia Dortmund in 2016. The Europa League winner spent two years at Old Trafford before joining rivals Arsenal as part of the ill-fated Alexis Sanchez swap deal in January 2018, but failed to truly settle at the Emirates. After just 18 months in north London, the 31-year-old joined Roma on a season-long loan deal last summer and is looking to extend his stay at the Stadio Olimpico. As quoted by Goal, the attacking midfielder said: "Of course I would like to be at Roma next season, not only next season [but] for another few years, but I still have a contract with Arsenal and it   s not up to me. It   s up to Arsenal and Roma if they will agree on terms of the transfer fee." He added: "So my thinking is to train hard, to play hard, to look forward to what   s going to happen.  Bella vittoria!

I   m not complaining, football life changes so quickly so you have to be ready to play wherever you are. "If not in Rome, I   m going to go back and play for Arsenal, if not, I   m going to stay here and play for Rome."
