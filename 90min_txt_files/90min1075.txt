Angel Di Maria is set to leave Juventus as a free agent after just one season in Turin, 90min understands.  The Argentine World Cup winner signed a one-year deal at Juve last summer following the expiration of his deal at Paris Saint-Germain. Following a rocky start to life in Serie A, during which he was sent off in a defeat to Monza for violent conduct, Di Maria's form improved dramatically in the first few months of 2023.  Di Maria would prove to be pivotal in Juventus' run to the UEFA Europa League semi-final, scoring a hat trick against Nantes back in February and following that up with a winner against Freiburg the following month.  Since that goal however, Di Maria has gone 14 appearances without a single goal contribution and attracted the frustration of fans for his performances in Juve's semi-final clashes against Sevilla.  feed 90min now understands that contract talks between Di Maria's representatives and Juve over a new one-year extension have broken down, with the forward now set to leave the club.  Sources have confirmed that there is interest from MLS and Saudi Arabian clubs in the player's services as he becomes a free agent for a second consecutive summer.  Both Di Maria and the club itself are in agreement that the best course of action is to part ways at the end of the season. The 35-year-old has previously enjoyed lengthy spells at European giants Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain, winning the UEFA Champions League in 2014 with the former.
