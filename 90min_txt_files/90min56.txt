The agent of Arsenal midfielder Jorginho has confirmed the Italian is not looking to move clubs this summer. Jorginho joined Arsenal from Chelsea back in January but has been linked with a move away from the Emirates Stadium during the current transfer window, with clubs from Saudi Arabia and Turkish side Fenerbahce reported to be keen. Nevertheless, 90min understands Arsenal are not planning on parting ways with Jorginho this summer, although the Italian is among a group of players for whom sizeable offers would be entertained. Speaking to Tuttomercatoweb, agent Joao Santos confirmed that Jorginho expects to end the summer with Arsenal. "Jorginho is focused, he is thinking about Saturday and playing his sixth year in the Premier League as well as his fifth in the Champions League," he said. "And above all, he is focused on the national team." feed Santos went on to confess he had received interest from clubs across the globe but reiterated the plan to keep Jorginho at Arsenal. "He will stay at Arsenal," the agent said. "He is happy to be in England. "Some enquiries, for example from Saudi Arabia. Someone called me, but nothing concrete. Jorginho is also appreciated in Spain, he's an important player. But he will stay at Arsenal." Declan Rice's summer switch to Arsenal has increased the competition for minutes at the base of the Gunners' midfield, where Thomas Partey also remains after a potential move to Saudi Arabia ultimately failed to materialise. Arsenal will get their Premier League campaign underway on Saturday with a visit from Nottingham Forest, with Jorginho expected to be part of Mikel Arteta's squad.
