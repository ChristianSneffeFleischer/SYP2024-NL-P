Chelsea have confirmed the signing of defender Marc Cucurella from Brighton on a permanent deal, with Levi Colwill moving in the opposite direction on a one-year loan. After Manchester City declined to meet Brighton's price tag of over  Â£50m, Chelsea swooped in to get a deal done for the versatile 24-year-old, who is a left-back by trade but also impressed in a left centre-back role for Brighton last season. "I   m really happy," Cucurella said after signing a six-year contract. "It   s a big opportunity for me to join one of the best clubs in the world and I   m going to work hard to be happy here and help the team." Chelsea chairman Todd Boehly added: "Marc is an elite defender of proven Premier League quality and he further strengthens our squad going into the new season. We continue to work on and off the pitch, and we   re delighted Marc will be a part of the present and future at Chelsea." In a separate deal, Blues academy graduate Colwill has moved to Brighton on a 12-month loan to help fill the void left by Cucurella. Colwill shone on loan with Huddersfield last season and Brighton have managed to fend off interest from a number of Premier League sides to give him his first taste of top-flight action.    Levi has enormous potential and has already shown his ability last season in the Championship and with England at various age group levels up to under-21s," said Brighton boss Graham Potter.
