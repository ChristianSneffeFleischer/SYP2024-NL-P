Riyad Mahrez is considering a lucrative offer to join the Saudi Pro League, though Manchester City are prepared to block his exit this summer while they address the future of Bernardo Silva, 90min understands. The Algeria winger enjoyed spells as a key starter for City during their treble-winning 2022/23 season, but was scarcely used during the run-in. Sources have told 90min that Mahrez was left dejected and unhappy that he did not play a single minute during the FA Cup or Champions League finals. Silva completed both sets of 90 minutes in Mahrez's place, and the duo's futures are interconnected. 90min reported earlier in June that Silva had asked to leave City in search of a new challenge and the club will not stand in his way if an offer in the region of  £75m comes in. PSG are believed to be preparing an offer for Silva, while he has his own suitors in Saudi Arabia. Due to Silva's likely exit, City are currently unwilling to sell Mahrez too, even though he does have an offer on the table. feed 90min understands that Saudi side Al Ahli have offered the 32-year-old a contract which would be worth  £45m-a-year. Mahrez will make a firm decision on if he wants to leave City for Al Ahli in the coming days, aware that engineering an exit from the Etihad Stadium could be tricky this window. City have already lost club captain Ilkay Gundogan on a free transfer to Barcelona, while they are set to miss out on Declan Rice to Arsenal. Mateo Kovacic became their first signing of the summer on Tuesday, joining from Chelsea for a  £25m fee.
