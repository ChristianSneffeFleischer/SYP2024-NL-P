AC Milan chief Paolo Maldini has admitted he is confident that Rafael Leao will soon sign a new contract but has confessed that the Chelsea target is 'not unsellable'. 90min revealed earlier in the summer that Chelsea had made an informal approach for the 23-year-old striker, with Maldini later confirming that he did not hesitate to turn the Blues' offer away. Sources have confirmed that Chelsea remain interested in Leao, however. Keeping Leao beyond the end of his current contract, which expires in 2024, has always been Milan's top priority but the Portugal international's future has been complicated by claims from Leao's boyhood side, Sporting CP, that he unfairly terminated his contract to join Lille in 2018, with the club looking for over    16m in damages.    Leao has a different situation which comes from his transfer to Lille,    Maldini told La Gazzetta dello Sport of the complications with Sporting.    This is having an impact, interlocutors have often changed, but Rafa is grateful to us and I take into account what he says.
