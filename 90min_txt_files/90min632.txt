Kai Havertz wrote an open letter to Chelsea shortly before his transfer to Arsenal was officially announced, admitting it is 'with a heavy heart' that he leaves the club. A deal worth over  Â£65m has been agreed just three years after Havertz became the second most expensive player in Chelsea   s history, and two years after scoring the winning goal in the 2021 Champions League final against Manchester City. But before confirmation from either club, Havertz's first interview as an Arsenal player was seemingly leaked, as were images of him wearing a Gunners shirt bearing his usual number 29. "It's super exciting for me, personally," he said in the footage. "I'm so glad to join this amazing club. I think this club has such a big history and I hope we can achieve lots of things, and I'm just looking forward to meeting all the players, the staff, it's going to be exciting." But Havertz later expressed regret on social media over the order in which things happened. feed "I would have preferred for you to hear my thoughts on leaving Chelsea first from myself before my thoughts on me joining my new team," he said. "This isn't my style and it upsets me that you had to hear of it in this way. I write this letter with a heavy heart to all the fans. A big thank you for all your support, we achieved a dream of winning the Champions League together!" The player explained: "I find myself at a crossroads where words can't describe the emotions I'm feeling. It is with a heavy heart that I write this letter, saying goodbye to the club that has become my second home, and to the incredible fans who have supported me throughout this amazing journey. "Joining Chelsea three years ago was a big moment in my life and I   m looking back on these years with nothing but pride, gratefulness and lots of sport success.
