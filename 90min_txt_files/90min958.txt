Fiorentina and Morocco midfielder Sofyan Amrabat has said it would be 'nice' to play in the Premier League in the future as he prepares to enter the final year of his current contract. Amrabat announced himself to the footballing world as the defensive midfield linchpin behind Morocco   s journey to the 2022 World Cup semi-finals in December. Those performances immediately put him in the shop window. 90min reported at the time that Liverpool and Tottenham were both interested in a January approach. Spurs were getting close to a deal, while Barcelona also made an ambitious loan offer. Manchester United are another club linked with the 26-year-old as part of their midfield rebuild. feed Amrabat is certainly open to the opportunity of heading to England, where older brother Nordin previously spent 18 months at Watford. But he is diplomatic, too, holding a strong admiration for both La Liga and Serie A as well. That being said, Amrabat thinks English football would 'suit' him. "Of course, the Premier League is a fantastic league, one of the strongest in the world. It would be nice to play there one day, but it   s not that I want only to go to England, because Spain is nice, Serie A is a nice league," the player told The Times ahead of Fiorentina   s Europa Conference League final. "Football has changed a lot, it   s more physical, you have more to be an athlete, the tempo and intensity is higher. Of course, in England the intensity is very high, so I think it could suit me."
