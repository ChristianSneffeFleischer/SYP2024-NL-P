You don't need to be Mauricio Pochettino to recognise just how much Chelsea need a new striker. The Blues have been 'bolstering' in attack for the last five years and yet still boast some of the worst goalscoring numbers in the Premier League. With Pochettino now installed in the dugout, it's the Argentine's turn to try and figure out a solution. Here are some strikers he could turn to. manual As one of Europe's top marksmen this season, Napoli hotshot Victor Osimhen is an obvious candidate here.Citing Didier Drogba as his idol, 24-year-old Osimhen has been outrageous this year, leading Serie A's scoring charts and helping turn the Partenopei into one of the continent's leading sides.The main issue here is Osimhen's price tag. Napoli agreed to pay up to    80m when they signed him from Lille in 2020 and the belief is he could cost twice as much as that this time around. Yikes. If you want a striker with Premier League experience, Ivan Toney appears the most feasible option. Well, that was until his eight-month ban for gambling offences.With his season now over, Toney ends the campaign with 20 league goals for Brentford. The last time Chelsea had a player reach that number? Diego Costa, six years ago.The ban obviously complicates things. Toney is not permitted to return to action until late January, 2024. That sounds like a discount. The cream of the crop when it comes to attainable Premier League strikers, Tottenham's Harry Kane may jump at the chance to reunite with the man who set him off on the journey to superstardom.Pochettino knows how Kane works and the pair's relationship remains strong. With his situation at Spurs growing more and more uncomfortable, the chance to jump ship may be too strong.Would Spurs ever sell to Chelsea? There's your real dilemma.
