Paris Saint-Germain manager Christophe Galtier has confirmed Lionel Messi will leave the club this summer. Messi's two-year contract with Les Parisiens' is due to expire this summer and rumours have been swirling about the legendary forward's future for a considerable amount of time.  Now, the Argentine World Cup winner's future has been confirmed by Galtier, who revealed in his pre-match press conference that this weekend's Ligue 1 clash with Clermont Foot will be the player's last with the club. "I had a privilege of coaching the best player in the history of football. It will be Leo's last match at the Parc des Princes against Clermont." feed The forward has been heavily linked with a mega money move to Saudi Arabia this summer - with Al Hilal keen to offer a    400m-a-year salary - but 90min understands former club Barcelona are currently confident of securing the player's services once again. While Bar  a won't be able to match the    400m-a-year wage packet Al Hilal can offer, they are confident they can work the financial levers enough to present Messi with an acceptable offer. Neymar could join Messi in leaving PSG this summer, having attracted interest from Newcastle United. 90min reported in early May that the club's owners PIF are keen to make Neymar a 'marquee' summer signing ahead of their first jaunt into the UEFA Champions League in two decades. One superstar who looks set to stay put is Kylian Mbappe, who stated he will be at PSG next season during the UNFP awards. "I am here to talk about the trophy," he responded to a question about his future. "Next season I'll be playing at PSG. I have one year left on my contract and I'm going to honour my contract."
