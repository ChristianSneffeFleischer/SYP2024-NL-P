Son Heung-min has assured Tottenham fans they do not need to be worried about him leaving for Saudi Arabia this summer. The South Korea international was named as a key target for Middle Eastern officials earlier this summer, with bids expected to arrive both in 2023 and in 2024, but Son has already insisted he does not want to listen to offers. Now out in Perth for Tottenham's pre-season tour of Australia, Son has once again shot down reports linking him with a move to Saudi Arabia. "If I wanted to go there I would be out there, not here," he told a press conference.  "I love playing football, obviously money is also important. I dream of playing in the Premier League and still a lot of things to do." feed Pushed for his inspiration to stay at Tottenham, Son insisted he wants to get back to his best form and re-establish himself as a top forward in an elite division like the Premier League. "I'm looking forward to it this season and obviously especially last season when I suffered physically.," he explained. "So this is not Sonny that I know.  "I want to prove this season that I'm the Sonny that we all know. I want to prove that to myself and I want to give back to the club where I belong.  "Saudi, obviously most people are going at the moment which is really, really interesting but it's a dream for me to play in the Premier League and I'm looking forward to this season."
