Liverpool have just the two senior centre backs until at least January then. Good. Ideal. Don't tell me you haven't already scoured the web for all the still-available free agents who can play in a back four, since Saturday afternoon's incident. Not only should Jordan Pickford be suspended for as long as Van Dijk is injured, but Pickford should also be forced to have the same operation and rehab. It's the only fair thing to do. Let me break down for you the 'best' unattached centre backs out there who could come in post transfer deadline to paper over the massive Virgil van Dijk-shaped void. Note: If you thought Steven Caulker was an odd signing, brace yourself... Most recent club: LyonRemember him from his 18 months at Newcastle between 2013 and 2014 when he became only the second player from the Central African Republic in the Premier League? No?! Call yourself a Barclays fan... Most recent club: CSKA SofiaPros: Has scored against Real MadridCons: Couldn't get a game for Derby five years ago. Most recent club: Al-FatehOne cap for Portugal, Pinto's career was petering out at home before he moved to Saudi Arabian side Al-Fateh for... entirely football reasons.  Most recent club: MiddlesbroughA regular under Tony Pulis, Shotton is not a 'ball-playing centre back'. He does, however, own a pub in Staffordshire. So, depends what you're after really. Most recent club: CelticOnly 26 and with top-level European experience, what's the catch?Well, injuries mainly. Simunovic, who was a regular for Croatia at youth level, is riddled with knee problems. So much so that Trabzonspor and Rijeka pulled out of summer moves to sign him.Shame, because when he's fit... Most recent club: Bristol CityOnce a fine player indeed, Ashley Williams is now 252 in dog years, moves at the speed of fingernail growth and hasn't played a Premier League game since 2018.Also that last game was, of course, for Everton.  Crunching                       40 + yard slide tackle                       screamer                          ? Sebastian Langkamp, #OnThisDay ? pic.twitter.com/tDvtYQ3lO1 Most recent club: Werder BremenA BuLi regular for the last decade, Langkamp once scored a 40-yard sliding tackle. Maybe worth a short-term deal for that alone to be honest. Most recent club: WatfordThe defender with Jamaican and Fijian heritage has over 150 games' worth of experience in the top flight, including 18 outings in the 2019/20 campaign when Watford... oh. Right. Yeah.
