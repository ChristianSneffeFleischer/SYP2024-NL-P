Newcastle midfielder Bruno Guimaraes has admitted having a    conversation    over a potential Real Madrid transfer during the summer but insists he feels    at home    at St James    Park. Bruno became an immediate fan favourite at Newcastle last season following his big money from Lyon in January, helping steer the Magpies to a mid-table finish after a poot start to the campaign and also beginning 2022/23 in a rich vein of form. Newcastle have averaged two points per game with him, compared to 0.7 points per game in a run out of the side through injury, and the Brazilian scored twice at the weekend in a comprehensive 5-1 thrashing of Brentford. Bruno was first linked with Real Madrid in August through reports in the Spanish press     Magpies boss Eddie Howe denied any intention of letting him go at the time. The player himself has now confirmed that Los Blancos were indeed in touch. Despite being flattered by the interest from    the best team in the world   , it was not an option he was prepared to explore any further.    I feel at home here! Real Madrid is the best team in the world. It is nice. It was just a conversation, but it is nothing,    he said of the transfer saga that never was. The 24-year-old, who has often pledged his commitment to Newcastle and has effectively become an honorary Geordie only a few months after arriving, also reiterated his loyalty to the club.    I never doubted the project. I believe it in the beginning. I always wanted to play in the  Premier League  and I enjoy it. The ground loves me and I love them. No joking, I am at home here. I need to keep going,    he said. Speaking after the Brentford game, Eddie Howe described Bruno as a    bargain in today's climate   .
