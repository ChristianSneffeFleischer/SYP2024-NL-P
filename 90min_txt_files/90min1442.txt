Paris Saint-Germain head coach Christophe Galtier has insisted he does not need to convince Kylian Mbappe to stay at the club. The French champions were eliminated at the last 16 of the Champions League for a second season running, bringing fresh questions about Mbappe's future to the surface. Mbappe turned down the chance to join Real Madrid on a free transfer last summer, signing a new two-year contract at PSG with the option for a third. Reports in Spain suggest Mbappe regrets this decision and wants Los Blancos to make another approach for him, but the European champions would prefer if the forward declined his option of an extension so he could join for free in 2024.

"I do not have to try to convince Kylian [to stay]," Galtier said. "Kylian has expressed it himself, but if you had asked any player you would have found him in the same state - very disappointed after the elimination. "Concerning Kylian, Kylian is a PSG player and he shows it in every game. He has a great determination to succeed and to perform well in order to help bring the club up to as high a level as possible." Mbappe became PSG's all-time leading scorer last week after grabbing a goal in their 4-2 win at home to Nantes, overtaking Edinson Cavani atop their historical charts. LISTEN NOW
