FC Dallas have completed the signing of goalkeeper Maarten Paes from Eredivisie side FC Utrecht, the club announced on Thursday. The Texas side have been in the market for a permanent option to man the posts after Jimmy Maurer was supplanted by Brazilian loanee Phelipe Megiolaro last season. The latter has since returned to Gremio in his homeland. Dallas initially looked set to sign Spanish stopper Cristian Rivero from La Liga giants Valencia but, as revealed by 90min last week, turned their attention to Paes. As reported, the 23-year-old joins Dallas on loan until July 2022 with the club holding the option to make the transfer permanent thereafter. Paes is clearly a talent with nine caps for the Netherlands under his belt across various youth levels. Since joining Utrecht in 2018, Paes has made 48 senior appearances for the club, keeping 12 clean sheets. Though he has fallen foul of a few mistakes more recently, Paes has been one of the stronger goalkeepers in the Eredivisie this season, averaging 2.53 saves per 90 minutes and keeping five clean sheets in 17 games. His arrival marks the latest step in a busy off-season for FC Dallas, who sold USMNT starlet Ricardo Pepi to Augsburg, while acquiring Portuguese right-back Nanu on loan from Porto. Homegrown Jesus Ferreira has signed a new contract as a Designated Player.
