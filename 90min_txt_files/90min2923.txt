New Paris Saint-Germain signing Nordi Mukiele has confirmed he rejected a late approach from Chelsea to seal his move to Parc des Princes. PSG agreed a fee with Mukiele's now former employers, RB Leipzig, and then quickly agreed on a contract as well, but before he jetted off for his medical, the Frenchman was the subject of a late approach from Chelsea. It amounted to nothing, however, with Mukiele arriving for his PSG medical just hours later and eventually completing his transfer. Speaking to L'Equipe, Mukiele insisted he did not hesitate to snub Chelsea's advances. "Honestly, no," he said when asked if Chelsea's interest led to any delays. "From the moment I had given my word to Luis Campos, at no time did I hesitate."
