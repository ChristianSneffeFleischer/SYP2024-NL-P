Barcelona are ready to move for Real Sociedad striker Alexander Isak if they fail in their bid to sign Borussia Dortmund's Erling Haaland this summer. Club president Joan Laporta is close with Haaland's agent, Mino Raiola, and hopes to use that to his advantage, but the reality is that Barcelona's delicate financial situation may leave them unable to afford such an expensive deal. Other suitors, like Real Madrid, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea, are in better positions to make such an offer and the feeling is that Barcelona may struggle to compete for Haaland's signature. According to Sport, manager Xavi has recommended Fiorentina hitman Dusan Vlahovic, but there are concerns over paying his price tag - in excess of  Â£60m - given he is untested in La Liga, and that is why the attention has turned to Isak. Isak was targeted by Barcelona last summer after he bagged 17 goals in 34 appearances for Sociedad, but there was simply not enough money to even humour such a deal. This time around, Barcelona believe they should have enough to get Isak, whose price may have dropped after a season in which he has netted just four goals in 17 appearances to date.
