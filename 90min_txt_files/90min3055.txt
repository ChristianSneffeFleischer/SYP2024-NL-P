Barcelona want to complete the signing of Robert Lewandowski by the end of the weekend after finally agreeing terms with Bayern Munich, 90min understands. The two European giants have been in talks for the Poland striker for weeks, and despite Bayern's insistence that they wouldn't sell Lewandowski, a deal worth around    50m in total has been agreed with Bar  a. 90min reported on Friday that the two clubs were closing in on agreeing a fee and they have now managed to thrash out negotiations, with the Blaugrana keen to wrap up the transfer by Monday. Lewandowski's agent Pini Zahavi had kept the likes of Chelsea and Manchester United informed of the situation should Barcelona have been unable to stump up the money required to force Bayern's hand. But Lewandowski has always favoured a move to Camp Nou and is now set to get his wish. Listen now to 90min's Talking Transfers podcast, with  Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey,  Harry Symeou  &  Toby Cudworth.
