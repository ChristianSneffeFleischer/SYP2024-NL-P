Ryan Gravenberch has revealed he expects to be at Bayern Munich for the 2023/24 season despite interest from the Premier League. The midfielder made the move from Ajax to the Allianz Arena last summer for a fee that could rise to    23m. Gravenberch was also the subject of interest from Manchester United, who are managed by his former manager from his time in Amsterdam, Erik ten Hag. But the 21-year-old struggled for regular minutes in his first season in Bavaria, making just three starts in the Bundesliga. 90min reported back in April that Gravenberch was unhappy with his situation at Bayern and had asked the club to consider letting him go if offers of first-team football came in. Liverpool are interested in signing Gravenberch and view him as a viable alternative to long-term target Jude Bellingham, who instead chose to sign for Real Madrid this summer. feed But speaking to Algemeen Dagblad, Gravenberch seemed resigned to staying at Bayern and insisted he now wants to make the move work. "I assume that I will still play at Bayern next season. That's really how I feel about it. I am with a top three club in the world. I think that's beautiful and special. I'm not giving up easily. My goal is still to succeed at Bayern," he said. "I have become more masculine and I think there is even more scope for that. It is incredible to see how players literally give everything here. Certainly other teams when they play against Bayern, as I was used to at Ajax. Players make much more ground here than in the Eredivisie." Gravenberch is currently on duty with Netherlands at the European Under-21 Championship. Bayern, meanwhile, are interested in adding Harry Kane to their ranks this summer, though Tottenham have denied reports that they have received a bid for the striker.
