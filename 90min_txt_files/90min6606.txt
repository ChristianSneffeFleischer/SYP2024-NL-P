Newcastle are confident of tying down Andy Carroll to a short-term contract extension which will see the striker remain on Tyneside for the remainder of the campaign. The Magpies announced the extension of Danny Rose's loan deal yesterday, while Valentino Lazaro has also agreed to an extended stay at St. James' Park.  Football Insider report that Carroll has reached a verbal agreement with the club over a brief contract extension, with the deal set to be signed off in the coming days. Despite the 31-year-old failing to score in the Premier League this term, Steve Bruce views Carroll as an invaluable member of his Newcastle squad and the Magpies boss is keen to finish the season with the same squad he had before the mid-March lockdown. Carroll's return to Tyneside following a seven-year spell at West Ham has been marred by injury, with the towering striker only good for 508 Premier League minutes this season - in which he's notched an impressive four assists.  He rejoined the Magpies last summer on a one-year deal with the option to extend for a further 12 months. Alongside Carroll, there's also hope of wrapping up the short-term extension of Spaniard Javier Manquillo, who has also reportedly verbally agreed to the deal. The club are, however, gradually becoming resigned to the fact that Matty Longstaff's Newcastle career will come to an end when his contract expires at the end of June.
