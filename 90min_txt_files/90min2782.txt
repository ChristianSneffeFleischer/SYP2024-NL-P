Hector Bellerin has been linked with a surprise move to Barcelona, with the Catalan giants looking for defensive cover this summer. The Spanish full-back spent last season on loan at Real Betis and made 32 appearances for the club as they won the 2021/22 Copa del Rey. Now back at Arsenal following the end of said loan, Bellerin is seeking a move away from the Emirates Stadium once again and, according to Mundo Deportivo, that move could be to Barcelona. Bellerin has been cited as an alternative target for the club after Cesar Azpilicueta signed a new deal at Chelsea. Bar  a had been confident of signing the Chelsea captain, and the player himself admitted to holding talks with the Blaugrana before ultimately decided to signed a two-year contract at Stamford Bridge.  Bellerin is a player that Barcelona have 'liked' for a while according to the Spanish publication as the club have registered an interest in his services in each of the last four seasons.
