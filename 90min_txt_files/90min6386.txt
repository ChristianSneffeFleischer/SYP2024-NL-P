Athletic Club centre-back Unai N    ez has been linked to a move away from San Mam  s, with Arsenal, West Ham and Everton all keeping tabs on the defender.  The 23-year-old, who has been at Athletic since the age of ten, is said to be unhappy with the number of minutes he has been getting, and is refraining from signing a new deal at his boyhood club.  N    ez has a    30m release clause in his contract, and the Basque club have been working on a new contract for their future defensive anchor for some time in order to get that figure puffed up     but with only 12 league starts this season, the centre-back is holding off putting pen to paper.  AS report that the centre-back's situation has attracted the interests of the Toffees and the Hammers, as well as Arsenal in the last few months. The interest in N    ez is not limited to English clubs though, as AC Milan and AS Monaco are also rumoured to be keen on bringing the Spaniard to San Siro and the Stade Louis II, respectively.  The Spanish paper is keen to emphasise, however, that despite the interest shown by Everton and amongst others, no official offers have been submitted yet.
