Barcelona are hopeful that Ousmane Dembele's situation will be resolved in January after the player came 'very close' to securing a move to Manchester United in the recently closed window. The Frenchman was viewed as an alternative to Jadon Sancho in United's search for a new winger but the two clubs couldn't reach a compromise regarding the deal. Barcelona were keen on a permanent sale so they could raise funds for Lyon skipper Memphis Depay but United were only offering a loan deal. Although, it's said the Red Devils proposed a rather substantial fee in a bid to bring Dembele to Old Trafford for the 2020/21 season. Nevertheless, while a deal couldn't be reached in the recently closed window, Catalonian-based news outlet SPORT (via Sport Witness) reports that there is hope that a 'solution' regarding the Frenchman will be discovered in January. By then, Dembele will have a year and a half left on his Barcelona contract and will reportedly be available for just over    50m. United will have another shot at securing the 23-year-old. Although, another approach for Dembele appears unlikely, especially after their deadline day business which saw young wingers Amad Diallo and Facundo Pellistri arrive at Old Trafford.  Set to cost Man United an initial fee of    30m, who is Amad Traore? ? The former will join the club in January after a  Â£30m deal was agreed with Atalanta.  Another club who could make a move for Dembele is Juventus, who were thought to be considering a swap deal for the 23-year-old earlier in the summer which involved Douglas Costa moving in the opposite direction.
