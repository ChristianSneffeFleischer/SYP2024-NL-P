Tottenham Hotspur have agreed to sign Dejan Kulusevski from Juventus for a    30m fee, sources have told 90min. The Sweden international has spent the last season-and-a-half on loan at Spurs and is set to continue his stay in north London. Kulusevski joined Tottenham back in January 2022, with his loan contract containing an obligatory purchase clause if Spurs qualified for the 2023/24 UEFA Champions League. But seeing as Tottenham finished eighth in the Premier League, this became an optional clause instead and the club have been working with Juventus to bring the fee down from    35m - 90min understands they have settled on a    30m deal. As negotiations over his future were ongoing, Kulusevski was not mentioned when Spurs announced their retained list, whereas fellow loanees Clement Lenglet and Arnaut Danjuma were. feed 90min reported earlier this week that Kulusevski - who was keen to join Spurs permanently - may have work to do in order to impress new head coach Ange Postecoglou, but sources close to his camp are confident that he will impress the Australian over the summer and throughout the season. Kulusevski was an instant success upon his arrival at Tottenham, linking up superbly with Harry Kane and Son Heung-min towards the end of the 2021/22 season and helping them to a fourth-place finish in the Premier League. However, due to injuries and general instability across the club, Kulusevski's 2022/23 campaign was not as prolific, ending the season with only two goals and eight assists across 37 games in all competitions.
