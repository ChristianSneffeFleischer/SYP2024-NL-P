Manchester City have received an offer to take Erling Haaland on loan while the Premier League pauses for the World Cup. Haaland's Norway were unable to reach the finals in Qatar and he is one of few City players who will be able to rest up during this winter's tournament. However, there is an offer on the table for Haaland to carry on playing competitively should he and City agree to it.

Non-league club Ashton United, who play in England's seventh tier of football, have confirmed that they have made an approach to City regarding a possible 28-day loan for Haaland. Ashton United manager Michael Clegg said: "It just makes sense to try and sign Erling on loan at Ashton United. City aren't playing and we want to keep Erling fit. It makes more sense than playing golf." News of the bid has resulted in Ashton United's website crashing due to increased traffic. While top-level football will resume only after the World Cup finishes, non-league football will continue through November and December, though many games are expected to have kick-off times altered in order not to clash with England matches.
