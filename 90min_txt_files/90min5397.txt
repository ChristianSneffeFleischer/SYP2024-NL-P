One Premier League agent has recommended that Manchester United full back Brandon Williams joins Premier League rivals Leeds or Southampton in January, in order to gain first team football. Williams enjoyed a breakthrough season at United during the 2019/20 campaign, making his first team debut in September and going on to feature 36 times in all competitions - including 25 as a starter. However, the 20-year-old is yet to make the match day squad in the Premier League for United this term, with Luke Shaw Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's first choice left back thus far. He has since been moved further down the pecking order following United's deadline day acquisition of Alex Telles. Williams' only two appearances for United this campaign came in the Carabao Cup, while he was a regular in last season's Europa League.  But with the Red Devils not facing Everton in the Carabao Cup until 22 December, coupled with Solskjaer's side playing in the Champions League instead of the Europa League this season, Williams could see his upcoming playing opportunities severely limited.  He was linked with a loan move on deadline day, but nothing materialised and he now faces a battle to force himself back into the first team reckoning.    Younger lads that didn   t go on loan will force a move,    one agent told the Athletic.    The Carabao Cup is out of the window for the next two months as the rounds have already been played. Fikayo Tomori and Billy Gilmour should go in January.
