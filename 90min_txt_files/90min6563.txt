Internazionale are looking to tie key midfielder Marcelo Brozovic to a lucrative new deal, which will keep him at San Siro until 2023, while also eliminating his release clause, according to a report in Italy. The 27-year-old Croatian has established himself as one of the key men in Antonio Conte's side this season, operating at the base of midfield in the Italian's system. According to Tuttsport, I Nerazzurri want to secure a new deal that puts an end to any chance that Brozovic could depart in the near future, by removing the tempting    60m ( Â£54m) release clause that exists in his current contract.  The Croatian's current deal ends in June 2022 and Inter CEO Beppe Marotta wants to ensure the club runs no risk of losing such a key player during a global financial crisis.  The new deal would tie Brozovic to another year in MIlan and include a significant salary increase, as well as removing the buyout clause. What a team move! ?Started by Brozovic, finished by Vecino.

The club already had good ties with the Croatian side, after the signing of Mateo Kovacic - now at Chelsea - which turned out to be a highly profitable deal for all parties.  Brozovic scored twice against city rivals AC Milan this season and has been the creator of many of Inter's trademark counter-attacking moves.
