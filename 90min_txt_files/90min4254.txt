Barcelona starlet Jean-Clair Todibo has left Camp Nou to join Nice on a permanent transfer as La Blaugrana push to slash their wage bill ahead of the coming season.  The 21-year-old spent the second half of the 2020/21 campaign on loan at Nice, and the French side inserted an option-to-buy clause in the deal.  And Bar  a confirmed on Sunday afternoon that the Ligue 1 outfit have opted to activate that clause, meaning he'll leave the Catalan giants for a fee of    8.5m, plus a further    7m in add-ons. La Blaugrana will also receive a percentage of any potential future sale.  Todibo joined Barcelona in July 2019, arriving from Toulouse on a free transfer. He then spent six months on loan at Bundesliga side Schalke, and the beginning of the 2020/21 campaign with Benfica. He did not feature at all in the Portuguese top flight, and he ended his loan spell prematurely, before joining Nice in February 2021. The centre-back has now found his permanent home for the foreseeable future, while Bar  a receive a decent fee with the possibility of even more money depending on his success in Ligue 1. This transfer will come as a great relief to club president Joan Laporta, as he continues to try and reduce their current wage bill.
