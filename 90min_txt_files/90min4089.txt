Manchester United's rumoured pursuit of Rennes midfielder Eduardo Camavinga has suffered a blow after it was revealed the Frenchman favours a move to Spain. The talented 18-year-old is one of most sought-after players in Europe this summer, with Rennes possibly willing to offload their star man - who has just one year left on his deal with the Ligue 1 side - in a bid to generate funds and balance the books following the collapse of the French football television deal. A whole host of potential suitors have been quick to lodge their interest in the France international, with Real Madrid seemingly frontrunners to sign the youngster - a scenario which seems bizarre given Los Blancos' ongoing financial woes. United haven't been deterred by Real's status as favourites to win the race for Camavinga's signature, though the MEN's claims that the Rennes man favours a move to Spain over in England will not be news that is welcomed at Old Trafford. The revelation couldn't have possibly come at a worse time for United after it was revealed Paul Pogba has rejected their latest bumper contract offer. With just one year remaining on his current deal, United are all too well aware that they could lose the midfielder for free next summer if they don't convince him to pen fresh terms. The offer tabled by the Red Devils was understood to have included a  £100,000-per-week pay hike on his current  £250,000-per-week deal, and so with Pogba seemingly in no mood to entertain their advances the club have now accepted they need to sell the World Cup winner this summer.
