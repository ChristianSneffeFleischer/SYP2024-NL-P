Veiga   s signed a new contract in the summer, but said contract included a release clause of just    40m. Sources have told 90min that Celta are open to selling Veiga this summer, and any sale worth would    40m be a club record - beating out the    20m they picked up from  Napoli for Stanislav Lobotka in 2020.   Coincidentally Napoli are also interested, along with German giants Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund.
