Chelsea have rejected an offer for Jorginho from Juventus which would have seen Miralem Pjanic heading to Stamford Bridge. Former Blues boss Maurizio Sarri is keen on reuniting with Jorginho after the two spent a season together in London     and three seasons together before that at Napoli     but the club have rejected the Old Lady's offer as they aren't interested in taking 30-year old Pjanic to Stamford Bridge. Frank Lampard's side have wasted no time recruiting for next season and have already landed Hakim Ziyech and Timo Werner ahead of the upcoming transfer window, but with Kai Havertz reportedly in Chelsea's sights, the Premier League side need to free up both squad space and money. While Jorginho has been one of Chelsea's more influential players this season, Lampard is willing to let the Italian move on, but CalcioMercato report that the Blues rejected Juventus' offer for the midfielder as they don't want Pjanic     and aren't interested in signing another midfielder as they prepare to make a move for Leverkusen's Havertz.  Pjanic has been at Juventus since 2016, but his future with the club is looking bleak; Sarri previously offering the Bosnian midfielder to Barcelona in exchange for Arthur.
