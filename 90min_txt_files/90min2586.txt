Nottingham Forest are in talks with Wolves over a deal for Willy Boly, 90min understands. Forest have already made 19 new signings since being promoted to the Premier League via the Championship play-offs. Renan Lodi was the 19th arrival on Monday, with the East Midlands club also on course to bring in free agent Serge Aurier as the 20th. Boly, who joined Wolves in the Championship, has four seasons of Premier League experience under his belt. But from being among the league   s most impressive centre-backs in 2018/19 when Wolves were newly promoted, the Frenchman suffered with injuries in 2019/20 and 2020/21. The 31-year-old then spent the first half of last season on the bench, before another injury, although he went on to start regularly in the closing weeks of the campaign. Even though Wolves have released Romain Saiss since the end of last season and also allowed Conor Coady to join Everton on loan, Bruno Lage has favoured a centre-back pairing of Max Kilman and  Â£20.5m new signing Nathan Collins in recent weeks. Boly hasn   t got off the bench.
