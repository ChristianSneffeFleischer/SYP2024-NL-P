Brentford could announce the signing of versatile Denmark international Mikkel Damsgaard as soon as Tuesday after agreeing a total    20m ( Â£16.8m) fee with Sampdoria, 90min understands. The Bees have been busy working hard in this summer's transfer market as they aim to fend off the Premier League's dreaded 'second season syndrome'. Thomas Frank has insisted that he doesn't believe in such a fallacy and that Brentford are well-equipped to survive, even after the departure of Christian Eriksen to Manchester United, and the west Londoners are set to continue their strengthening with the purchase of Damsgaard. Brentford will pay an initial    14m plus    6m in add-ons for the 22-year-old, who missed most of last season with a thigh problem. The Bees will beat several clubs from across Europe for his signature. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  &  Sean Walsh  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Chelsea's plans to sign Wesley Fofana.
