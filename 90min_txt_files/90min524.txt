Manchester United midfielder Bruno Fernandes has welcomed Mason Mount to the club with a tongue-in-cheek post on his Instagram story. Mount completed his move to the Red Devils on Wednesday, bringing an end to his 18-year stay at boyhood club Chelsea. Man Utd pursued the England international heavily following the conclusion of the 2022/23 season and made him a priority target. They had three bids rejected by Chelsea before eventually agreeing to a fee of  £55m, with a further  £5m potentially to come in add-ons. manual Mount has signed a five-year contract with the option for a further 12 months and spoke of his excitement at joining Man Utd in his unveiling interview, with football director John Murtough hailing him as 'world class'. It seems Mount's arrival has lifted the dressing room too, with vice-captain Fernandes taking to social media to welcome a fellow attacking midfielder in typical combative fashion.

The Red Devils will not, however, be pursuing the permanent signing of Marcel Sabitzer following his loan spell from Bayern Munich. Mount is also capable of playing on either flank and his versatility is expected to prove useful to manager Erik ten Hag.
