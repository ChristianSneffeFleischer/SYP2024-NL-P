Bayern Munich are open to parting ways with forward Sadio Mane after just 12 months at the club, 90min understands. Mane joined Bayern from Liverpool last summer in a deal worth around  Â£35m but the Senegal international has failed to hit the heights expected of him, recording seven goals and four assists in 22 Bundesliga outings. Off the field, Mane has also attracted unwanted attention after a physical altercation with teammate Leroy Sane which saw him handed a suspension and a fine. Sources have confirmed to 90min that new Bayern boss Thomas Tuchel has not been impressed by Mane and has made it clear to those in charge at the Allianz Arena that he is prepared to offload the 31-year-old this summer. Bayern have long been planning to sign a new central striker this summer, with the likes of Tottenham's Harry Kane and Eintracht Frankfurt's Randal Kolo Muani on their radar, and Tuchel is willing to cash in on Mane to help fund such a move. feed While Mane's age means Bayern are unlikely to demand a significant fee for his services, there is an awareness that his wage demands will limit the number of sides able to strike a deal. Interest in Mane is expected from the Premier League, where Mane racked up 111 goals and 47 assists across 263 games for Liverpool and Southampton, while Bayern also see Paris Saint-Germain as viable suitors. As well as a new central striker, Bayern are also known admirers of Chelsea forward Kai Havertz and could pursue a move for the German this summer. While Havertz has spent most of his Chelsea career in a central role, Bayern are understood to see the 23-year-old as a replacement for Thomas Muller, who has made a career out of floating around behind an out-and-out striker.
