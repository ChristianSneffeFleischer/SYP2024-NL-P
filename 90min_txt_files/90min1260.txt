READ MORE FROM THE 90MIN TALKING TRANSFERS TEAM feed Representatives from Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur were all at Balaidos. Arsenal, Brentford, Brighton, Chelsea and Newcastle have all previously watched Veiga this season. 90min understands that of these interested clubs, Man City are pushing hard to strike a deal for Veiga. Real Madrid have previously held talks over a deal for him, but they are also close to tying Dani Ceballos down to a new contract and are still in the race for Jude Bellingham. Upon signing a new contract last year, Celta increased the release clause in Veiga's contract to    40m. It is likely that they will demand this in full if they are to sell him this summer, which would make him the club's record sale - Stanislav Lobotka's transfer to Napoli in 2020 for    20m stands as their current record sale.
