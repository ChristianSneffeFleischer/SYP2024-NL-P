Bayern Munich have signed long-term target Leroy Sane from Manchester City on a five-year deal. The forward had long been linked with a move to Bavaria and will join the Bundesliga champions immediately, meaning he will not feature for City for the rest of the season. #ServusLeroy ?   #FCBayern #MiaSanMia @LeroySane19 pic.twitter.com/ZgxpMXg8mR The 24-year-old departs the Etihad Stadium as a two-time Premier League and League Cup winner - and also boasts a 2019 FA Cup medal. Overall, he made 135 appearances for the Citizens, scooping the PFA Young Player of the year award at the end of the 2017/2018 campaign. Bayern sporting director Hasan Salihamidzic revealed his delight at finally getting his man in a statement released on the club's website.     We   re delighted Leroy is to be a Bayern player. Leroy is a difference-maker and will strengthen our team with his quality. With  Serge Gnabry,  Kingsley Coman and Leroy, we   re now even better equipped at a very high level in the wide positions that are important for our game.

Sane expressed similar excitement at the move, rumoured to be costing Bayern around    60m with    49m being paid up front and the rest add-ons.  Nah Alphonso Davies and Leroy Sane on Bayern   s left side for the next decade is some kind of sick joke on everyone else isn   t it https://t.co/ArA9J99rOw    FC Bayern is a great club with big goals - and these goals suit me as well. I'm looking forward to the new challenge and can't wait to train with the team. I know  Hansi Flick  from the U21 national team, we had a very good relationship there. I want to win as many trophies as possible with FC Bayern, and the Champions League is the top priority," he said. City Director of Football Txiki Begiristain added: "From arriving as a fledgling young talent four years ago, we are proud of the contribution Leroy has made since joining Manchester City. He leaves with many friends and fond memories of his time at the Etihad."
