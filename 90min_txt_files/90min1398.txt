Bayer Leverkusen midfielder Florian Wirtz has laughed off speculation that he has spoken with Barcelona about a future move to Camp Nou. The 19-year-old, who has recently made his return from a serious knee injury, is widely heralded as one of the best young players on the planet and repeatedly sees himself linked with a number of the game's top sides. Indeed, recently it's Barcelona who have been touted as suitors, with Sky Germany claiming that the Blaugrana had reached out to Wirtz's father, who is also his agent, to discuss a move in the near future. Asked if there was any truth to the speculation, Wirtz was adamant he knew nothing of supposed interest from Barcelona. "I haven't heard anything from my father about Barcelona, and I was surprised when I read it," Wirtz told a press conference.

While many reports cite 2024 as a potential transfer date for Wirtz, the teenager remains under contract in Leverkusen until 2027, with the German side tying him down shortly after his injury to prove their commitment to him.
