Ramos has stepped for Benfica up in the absence of Darwin Nunez so this season, starting all of the club   s five games across the Primeira Liga and Champions League qualifiers and scoring five goals     in addition to three assists     in the process. The Algarve-born starlet won   t turn 22 until next summer and is suddenly one of the brightest emerging talents in Portugal.
