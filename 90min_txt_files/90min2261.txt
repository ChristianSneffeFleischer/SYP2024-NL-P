Bayern Munich have shunned enquiries for Leroy Sane and insist they are not looking to sell the German winger, 90min understands. The 26-year-old was first linked with a move away from the Allianz Arena in the summer following the arrival of Sadio Mane from Liverpool, and unsurprisingly the Senegalese star has made a significant impact at the Bavarian giants. He has been a virtual ever-present on the left side, scoring 11 time in 23 games, which has impacted on some of his new teammates playing time. Sane is one of those to have seen his number of starts restricted, although that is also because Bayern boss Julian Nagelsmann has been using the likes of Serge Gnabry and Jamal Musiala ahead of him on a regular basis. Despite the battle for playing time, the former Manchester City star has enjoyed a productive season of his own, with five goals and three assists from just eight Bundesliga starts. He has also claimed four goals in four Champions League starts, which Bayern believe highlights his importance to the squad.
