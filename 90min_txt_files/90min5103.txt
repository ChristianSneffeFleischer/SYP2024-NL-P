Memphis Depay could join Barcelona for as little as    5m in the January transfer window, as Lyon look to cash in on the Dutchman before his contract expires in the summer of 2021.  The 26-year-old has only six months remaining on his current deal, and has shown no signs of putting pen to paper on an extension, meaning he could potentially walk away from the French club for absolutely nothing at the end of the season.  Lyon are resigned to losing their talisman, and may be prepared to accept a severely reduced bid in the winter to gain some sort of a financial return on the striker. And according to French outlet le10Sport, Barcelona are in pole position to sign Depay - for as little as    5m.  La Blaugrana are known admirers of the former Manchester United star, and coach Ronald Koeman was keen to bring him to Camp Nou in the summer, having worked together closely in the Netherlands' national team setup.  That deal fell through due to the financial ramifications of the coronavirus outbreak which Bar  a endured, as well as suffering from possessing an extremely bloated squad.  Having significantly reduced the wage bill in the summer, they are now in better shape, and are looking to bolster their options in the winter. And knowing that they can secure Depay for next to nothing may convince the club to take the plunge immediately, rather than waiting to snap him up for free next summer.
