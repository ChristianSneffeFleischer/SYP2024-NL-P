Arsenal have reached a full agreement to sign defender Jurrien Timber from Ajax, 90min understands. 90min reported last week that the Gunners had seen an offer of an initial fee of    42m, with    5m in add-ons, accepted by Ajax last week despite the Eredisivie side being keen to get around    60m for the player this summer. With finer details and personal terms with the player now agreed too, the talented defender is set to undergo medical before the weekend. Sources have confirmed that Timber's medical could even be before Declan Rice's, with the England star set to undergo his on Friday. feed Rice is set to complete a British-record transfer to Arsenal this week after the Gunners agreed a fee worth  £100m plus performance related add-ons to sign the gifted midfielder from West Ham. 90min understands that both deals will be officially announced by the end of this week. Timber and Rice will be the Gunners' second and third signings of an extremely active summer transfer window at the Emirates Stadium. Kai Havertz joined the club for a fee in excess of  £65m last week from Chelsea, meaning their summer spend could soon exceed the  £200m mark. Arsenal are keen to strengthen and build upon a season in which they came within a whisker of winning their first Premier League title since 2003/04. Mikel Arteta's team were pipped to the post by eventual treble-winners Manchester City during the 2022/23 campaign despite leading the Premier League title race for 248 days - the most of any team not to finish in first.
