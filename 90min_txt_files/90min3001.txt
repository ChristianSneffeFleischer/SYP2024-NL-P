Paris Saint-Germain forward Neymar has insisted that he has not been asked to leave the club and that he would like to stay. Reports in recent months have suggested that the Brazilian superstar could be sold in order to help move the club into a new era, particularly after president Nasser Al-Khelaifi revealed he doesn't want PSG to be considered a 'flashy, bling bling' team anymore. The Parisians were said to have offered Neymar as a makeweight in a move for Bernardo Silva recently, though this was denied by Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola, who distanced himself from interest in the winger. And speaking to AFP, Neymar revealed that he has no desire to leave PSG, nor have the club contacted him regarding a potential departure. "I want to stay at Paris Saint-Germain. No one from the club told me anything about the plans for my future, as things stand," he said. "I don   t know what kind of plans they have for me - I want to stay."
