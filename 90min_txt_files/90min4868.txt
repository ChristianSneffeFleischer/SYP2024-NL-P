Arsenal are understood to be in talks with Shkodran Mustafi with a view to terminating his contract with the club early.  If an agreement were to be reached, the Germany international would follow Mesut Ozil and Sokratis Papastathopoulos out of the door, making him the third player the Gunners have cut ties with prior to the end of their contracts in recent weeks. Shkodran Mustafi is in talks with Arsenal to terminate his contract early (similar agreement to Ozil & Sokratis).28-year-old defender hasn't played since Boxing Day and his reps are trying to secure a January move for him.https://t.co/F4bx49hy3j According to Football.London, the club offered the player a contract extension during the summer, but it's understood that the 28-year-old rejected the proposal and his representatives are now looking for a way out of the Emirates Stadium for their client.  Mustafi has made just three substitute appearances in the Premier League so far this season, making it clear that the World Cup winner is out-of-favour with Mikel Arteta, and therefore you can understand why a solution that will see him depart sooner is being discussed. It's said that there is interest in the centre-back from a number of European clubs but with just a few months remaining on his current deal there is no way Arsenal are going to be able to command a substantial fee for him, particularly in this financial climate. His last appearance for the Gunners came on Boxing Day when he was introduced as a late substitute  to assist the team in defending their lead over Chelsea. Since his arrival in north London, he's made 151 appearances for the club, contributing nine goals along the way.
