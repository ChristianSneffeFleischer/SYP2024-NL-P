Leeds United are closing in on the signing of defender Robin Koch, with the defender poised to have a medical at the club over the weekend. The Whites are in the hunt for a new centre half for the second successive summer after Ben White returned to Brighton following the conclusion of his loan spell at Elland Road. White had been instrumental in Leeds' promotion winning campaign, but the club saw bids rejected as they attempted to bring the youngster to Yorkshire on a permanent deal.  The defender is poised to sign a new, long-term contract with Brighton and commit his future to the Seagulls instead. As a result, Leeds have turned their attentions to German international Koch. 90min understands the club believe that they have won the battle to land the 24-year-old, and are trying to push through a move before the deal can be impeded by other clubs. The Freiburg defender has also attracted interest from Fulham, Newcastle and Everton, but Leeds believe they are close to securing his signature and are hopeful of a deal coming to fruition within days. According to the Daily Star, Koch will have a medical at Leeds over the weekend before completing a  Â£13m move. Should the medical go swimmingly, the Eintracht Trier academy product will sign a long term deal with the club. Koch's Freiburg contract expires in 2021, and the club are prepared to cash in on the defender to prevent them from losing him for nothing next summer.
