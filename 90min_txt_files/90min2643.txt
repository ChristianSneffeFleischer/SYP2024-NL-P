Alexander Isak has arrived in the north east of England as he closes in on becoming Newcastle   s new record signing in a    70m ( Â£59m) transfer from Real Sociedad. 90min revealed on Wednesday that Newcastle   s bid had been accepted by the Spanish club, with Sweden international Isak having long been on the Magpies    radar. Isak has a    90m buyout clause in his contract with La Real and the San Sebastian-based side were not prepared to let the 22-year-old leave until their valuation was met. Despite falling short of triggering the clause, Newcastle   s bid was seen as too much to turn down. Now, 90min understands that Isak has travelled to Newcastle in the hope that everything can be finalised in time for him to make his debut in the Premier League this weekend, especially with Callum Wilson nursing an injury     Eddie Howe   s team face Wolves at Molineux on Sunday. Personal terms with Isak are all but agreed and the two clubs are in the process of tying up the final details. He will need to be registered by midday on Friday to be eligible to play this weekend.
