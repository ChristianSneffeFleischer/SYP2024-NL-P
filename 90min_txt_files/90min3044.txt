Chelsea attempted to hijack Gabriel Jesus' move to Arsenal this summer, according to the player's agent.  Jesus completed a  Â£45m switch to the Emirates Stadium earlier this month, becoming the Gunners' highest paid player in the process.  The Brazilian has got his Arsenal career off to a strong start too, netting a brace on his debut during pre-season and also registering a goal and assist in his side's 2-0 victory over Everton in Baltimore recently.  However, the Gunners were not the only Premier League side keen on signing the forward.  Marcelo Pettinati, who represents Jesus, has confirmed that Chelsea also enquired about a transfer.    Chelsea were one of the teams that tried to hijack the Arsenal move. They tried very hard in the final days to get him. By that point, we   d already chosen our new project,    he told Freddie Paxton. The Blues have not had much luck in the summer transfer window so far, missing out on several of their targets.
