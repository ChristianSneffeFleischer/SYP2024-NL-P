Barcelona believe Antoine Griezmann has already played enough minutes to make his loan with Atletico Madrid permanent and they are preparing a law suit in the hope of securing a    40m transfer fee. The argument from Atleti is that Griezmann's loan contract states he must play 50% of the available minutes over both seasons, not just one, and so their obligation has not yet been triggered. Paris Saint-Germain are also keeping a close eye on Griezmann's situation as they prepare a bid to sign him next summer. The Ligue 1 champions believe Lionel Messi could depart in 2023 and see Griezmann as an ideal replacement.
