Aston Villa have opened talks with Moussa Dembele's representatives ahead of a potential January move, 90min understands.  The Villans are keen to sign a new striker after West Ham United agreed terms to sign Danny Ings for a reported  Â£15m, with the Hammers keen to complete the deal before this weekend's relegation six-pointer against Everton.  Ings' departure has led to interest from Aston Villa in striker Dembele - a player whose current contract at Olympique Lyonnais is due to expire during the summer.  On this edition of Talking Transfers, Scott Saunders hosts Toby Cudworth & Graeme Bailey to discuss all the big transfer stories. This week's agenda includes Jude Bellingham, Harry Kane, Declan Rice, Hakim Ziyech, Leandro Trossard, Pedro Porro, Mykhaylo Mudryk and more!
