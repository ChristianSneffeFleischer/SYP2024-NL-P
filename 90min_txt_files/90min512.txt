Paris Saint-Germain have confirmed the signing of defender Milan Skriniar on a five-year contract following his exit from Inter. The Slovakia international established himself as one of the best centre backs in Europe during his six-year stint with Inter as he won a Serie A title, two Coppas Italia and finished as a runner up in both the Europa League and Champions League. Inter confirmed Skriniar's departure last Friday, thanking the 28-year-old for his role in their "extraordinary growth path" which includes five trophies in the last three seasons. Skriniar said: "I am very happy to be part of this wonderful club. PSG is one of the best clubs in the world, with world class players and fantastic fans." feed His arrival will boost PSG's defensive options following the departure of Sergio Ramos on a free transfer. An injury to Presnel Kimpembe limited their options at the back last season and Skriniar will provide competition for the Frenchman alongside club captain Marquinhos. Luis Enrique has been confirmed as Christophe Galtier's replacement at Parc des Princes in his first job since leaving the Spain role following their 2022 World Cup campaign. Stefan de Vrij remains a key part of the Nerazzurri team while Alessandro Bastoni has just signed a new contract to remain at San Siro until 2028. Francesco Acerbi also started alongside Matteo Darmian in Inter's back three during the Champions League final defeat to Manchester City.
