Real Madrid would have to pay around    50m for Rennes midfielder Eduardo Camavinga this summer, but outspoken agent Jonathan Barnett has suggested that Los Blancos might not actually be able to afford the coveted teenager. Barnett is most famously the agent of Gareth Bale and won the rights to represent Camavinga, who is tipped to become a superstar in years to come, in December. Camavinga was only 16 when he made his first-team debut for Rennes in April 2019 and has been a regular ever since. He also made his senior international debut for France earlier this season and became the youngest player to appear for Les Bleus since 1932. 90min revealed back in October that Real Madrid consider Camavinga to be a priority target this coming summer alongside fellow France internationals Kylian Mbappe and Paul Pogba.  Zinedine Zidane had repeatedly been asking president Florentino Perez for Mbappe, Pogba and N   Golo Kante for a year prior, but Camavinga moved into contention in place of the latter. Real failed to come up with the money for Pogba in 2019 after spending big on Eden Hazard, Luka Jovic, Eder Militao and Ferland Mendy, while they opted against signing anyone in the summer of 2020 as the coronavirus pandemic gripped club finances.    Madrid are going through a tough time just now. All Spanish clubs are the same, so unfortunately we will have to see what happens. It may be that Spanish clubs can't afford  Camavinga,    Barnett is quoted as saying by Marca.    [Madrid are]  a great club, a great club to play for.  Eduardo  will have a choice of a lot of clubs if Rennes decides to release him.  They will be one of the four of five clubs in the world he might go to.    Eduardo would love to play for a top club. Madrid are one of those top clubs in the world, so are  Barcelona. I think [a fee of    50m will be needed] to secure his signature.
