Tottenham Hotspur head coach Ange Postecoglou is desperate for James Maddison to join the club this summer, sources have told 90min. Spurs are hoping to bring in several new players this transfer window. Dejan Kulusevski has completed a permanent move from Juventus following his initial loan spell, while goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario is on the verge of joining from Empoli. Next up on their agenda is Maddison, who has one year left to run on his contract at Leicester City. The Foxes were relegated from the Premier League at the end of the 2022/23 season and had set a  £60m price tag on the England international. However, 90min understands that Leicester are willing to slightly lower this figure, while Tottenham are set to make a firm offer of  £40m plus add-ons. feed Spurs' squad is currently without a player of Maddison's creative and technical profile, which is a problem they are trying to address given new head coach Postecoglou's desire to play a possession-based brand of football. Sources have confirmed to 90min that the Australian had hoped Maddison was going to be their first signing of the summer, with Tottenham working hard to now find an agreement with Leicester and personal terms expected to be thrashed out with relative ease. Maddison has been a long-term target for Tottenham, dating back to his days as a Coventry City player in the mid-2010s. Newcastle United are also interested in Maddison but as of yet have not made a concrete bid of their own. The Magpies are closing in on the blockbuster signing of Sandro Tonali, while they are in talks with Southampton over full-back Tino Livramento.
