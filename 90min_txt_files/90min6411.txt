Achraf Hakimi's agent has insisted that Real Madrid manager Zinedine Zidane must take the blame for the Moroccan's departure from the Santiago Bernab  u this summer. Hakimi has just finished a two-year loan spell with Borussia Dortmund in which he established himself among the world's elite in his position, but Real were surprisingly willing to allow the 21-year-old to move to Inter for around  Â£36m. With Real close to a squad rebuild, it seemed certain that Hakimi would become Los Blancos' starting right-back for the next decade, so the Inter move came as quite a shock. Speaking to Al Mountakhab,  agent Martin Camano was quick to point the finger at Zidane.    Zidane is the reason for Hakimi   s transfer to Inter," he insisted. "He must explain why Hakimi moved.    I think that Hakimi   s return at the current time was not appropriate given the presence of a distinguished player like Dani Carvajal and I   m sure that Hakimi   s future will be bright after taking this step forward." Real were expected to get their rebuild going this summer, with the likes of Borussia Dortmund's Erling Haaland and Bayer Leverkusen's Kai Havertz in their sights, but the coronavirus crisis has forced them to shelve plans for another year. Despite that issue, Real were still expected to welcome Hakimi back with open arms, but once it became clear that he had no future in Madrid, there was plenty of interest in his services. 90min revealed that Chelsea, Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur had all enquired about Hakimi's availability, but Camano revealed that Antonio Conte's determination to land the right-back made it impossible to turn Inter down.    Conte was always in contact with Hakimi,    he said.    He talked to him about the club   s future project, so we decided to move to Inter.
