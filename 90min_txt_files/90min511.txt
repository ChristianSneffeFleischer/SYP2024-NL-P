Arda Guler's father has seemingly confirmed in a post on WhatsApp that his son will turn down the advances of Barcelona in order to join Real Madrid this summer. The talented 18-year-old has emerged as a major target for both clubs after putting in some hugely promising performances for Fenerbahce. 90min reported on Wednesday that both Barcelona and Real had made offers to land the teenager, with their bids - understood to be around the    20m mark - exceeding the release clause written into his contract so it can be paid in instalments. Realare confident of winning the race to sign Guler, believing that chief scout Juni Calafat has done enough to convince him that his future lies in the Spanish capital - he also played a similar role in Jude Bellingham's move from Borussia Dortmund earlier this summer. feed And that confidence appears to have been echoed by Guler's father, Umit, after he posted a clip on WhatsApp of a scene from a Turkish television show. "Let's go on vacation to Barcelona," a woman says in the scene posted, to which her husband responds "No way I will go to Barcelona. I will only go to Real Madrid".  Guler has been one of the most talked about young midfielders in Europe ever since he broke through into Fenerbahce's first team in August 2021. He became the youngest goalscorer in the club's Super Lig history soon after, with his displays thereafter earning him the coveted number ten shirt. Should the move to Madrid go through as expected, Guler will join an exciting pool of young players expected to reach the top of the game. Bellingham, Aurelien Tchouameni and Eduardo Camavinga are all committed to the club long-term, while Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo look likely to command starting roles up front for many years to come.
