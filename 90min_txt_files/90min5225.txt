West Ham and Leeds are eyeing up a potential  £11.6m move for Barcelona striker Martin Braithwaite in January. Braithwaite signed for Barcelona in a shock  £15m deal in February following the club receiving special dispensation to sign him after Ousmane Dembele picked up a long-term injury. Since the signing though, as expected, it hasn't really worked out for the Denmark international. He has made just 16 appearances since joining the club, scoring just the one goal. With Ronald Koeman coming in as manager in the summer Braithwaite's chances of breaking into the side have become even slimmer, with the Dutch coach opting to use youngsters Ansu Fati, Trincao and Pedri ahead of him. This has alerted sides to his availability, with West Ham and Leeds taking a particularly close look according to HITC, via Sport. Reports suggest that both Premier League clubs are keen to add some firepower to their side in January as they look to steer clear of a relegation battle. While West Bromwich Albion are also said to be showing an interest, it's claimed that David Moyes and Marcelo Bielsa's sides have already made enquiries. With Euro 2020 due to take place next summer Braithwaite is desperate to secure his place in the Denmark squad, but needs regular game time to be able to stake a claim. West Ham currently have Sebastian Haller and Michail Antonio as their striker options, but Haller has struggled since his club record move from Eintracht Frankfurt. Leeds have opted to use Patrick Bamford as their main striker this season and he has performed well, scoring seven goals so far.
