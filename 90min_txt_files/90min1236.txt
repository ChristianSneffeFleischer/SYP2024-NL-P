Brighton midfielder Alexis Mac Allister has insisted he would be happy to stay at the AMEX Stadium beyond the current campaign. Mac Allister is enjoying a sensational season which included an international breakout as he helped lead Argentina to World Cup glory in Qatar, and 90min understands a number of Premier League giants are keen to sign him this summer. Liverpool, Newcastle, Tottenham, Chelsea and Manchester United are all known admirers of Mac Allister, whose father recently confessed that he expects to seal a move away from the AMEX at the end of the season. Speaking to ESPN, Mac Allister confirms that he would expect to have a conversation with Brighton this summer if a suitable bid arrives, but stressed that he is more than happy to remain if not. "The truth is that I am very happy at the club," Mac Allister said. "I try not to think about the future. feed "I know there's a lot of talk and I think it's normal after winning the World Cup. Already, in the January market, there was a lot of talk, but I'm very calm. I focus on playing, on training every day, on continuing to improve. "Like I said, I have a lot of respect for Brighton. I respect this club a lot because I am very grateful. "Later in the summer, we'll see. If an offer arrives that could be good for the club and for me, we will sit down and talk. If not, I will continue to be very happy at this club." Brighton have a battle on their hands to retain their midfield core as, alongside Mac Allister, there is significant interest in Ecuador international Moises Caicedo. Caicedo is wanted by a number of sides in the Premier League, including Arsenal, but he recently confessed that he dreams of joining Real Madrid.
