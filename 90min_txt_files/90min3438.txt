Newcastle United manager Eddie Howe insists he sees a long-term future for Allan Saint-Maximin at the club. 90min confirmed rumours earlier this week that Newcastle were open to letting Saint-Maximin depart St James' Park this summer amid concerns over his wage demands in talks over a new contract. The 25-year-old still has four years left to run on his current deal but is understood to want a pay rise after establishing himself as the team's talisman, and sources close to the situation have confirmed that Newcastle are not currently planning to meet those demands. As such, Newcastle are open to letting Saint-Maximin go for the right price, but manager Howe has stressed that he does not want to lose such a valuable asset. "He's an incredible talent and yes, of course he has a long-term future at the club," said Howe. However, Howe did warn Saint-Maximin - and the rest of the Newcastle squad - that they must not let their training levels slip if they want to remain at the club in the long run. "I think everyone's always playing for their future," Howe said.
