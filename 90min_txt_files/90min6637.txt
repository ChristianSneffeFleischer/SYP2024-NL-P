Inter have identified Brescia's highly acclaimed youngster Sandro Tonali as their 'primary' transfer target, as Antonio Conte looks to strengthen the core of his side ahead of the 2020/21 season. The 20-year-old has become one of the hottest properties in world football despite Brescia's Serie A struggles, and has often been compared to Andrea Pirlo - who enjoyed a legendary career with the Inter's rivals Milan and Juventus. Inter have previously been tipped to complete a    50m deal for Tonali ahead of Juve, but a move has failed to materialise as yet. However, he remains the club's priority target - with renowned transfer guru Gianluca Di Marzio (via SempreInter) telling Sky in Italy that he remains number one in their eyes. "[Tonali] has become the primary objective for Inter," he said. "For age, costs, for the fact he is Italian and for the fact he is a player very much appreciated by the club." Inter have also been linked with Federico Chiesa in the last six months, with the young winger currently the standout player for Fiorentina. Concerning a potential move to San Siro, Di Marzio noted that talks are at a very early stage, saying: "The negotiation hasn't taken off, beyond some contact in recent days." Di Marzio also provided an update on Barcelona's ongoing pursuit of Lautaro Martinez, with La Blaugrana strongly linked with a move for the Argentinian striker.  "To date, there is no agreement between the two clubs. For the last few days, the negotiation is on stand-by," he remarked.
