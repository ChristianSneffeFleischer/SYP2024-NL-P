Jordi Alba says Lionel Messi's potential return to Barcelona would be 'perfect for me' and admits seeing the legendary winger play away from Camp Nou is strange. Financial difficulties forced Messi - the best player in Bar  a history - to leave for Paris Saint-Germain in August 2021, shaming those in charge of the Catalan club at the time. However, Messi's deal with PSG expires in the summer and 90min understands he is not expected to pen fresh terms with the French giants, instead favouring a return to Bar  a. Alba played alongside Messi for 345 games in Blaugrana colours and revealed the World Cup winner coming back to Bar  a would benefit his own game. He told Goal:    It is Leo's decision. Honestly, we haven't talked about this topic, but it's clear that in the end, seeing Messi with another shirt other than Barca's is always weird. "In the end, if he wants to and the club wants to, it's perfect for me. He has been the player with whom I have understood the best on the pitch." feed Off-field issues continue to dog Bar  a's image, with Alba admitting issues like the Negreira scandal make finding downtime trickier. He added: "It's not pleasant to see all this news and so much noise. It's difficult to isolate and disconnect. "Besides, players like me, who have been Barca fans since we were little kids, it's true that it's not pleasant, but we have to compete, keep scoring points, isolating ourselves from everything and winning games, whatever the situation may be." Alba may feature in Bar  a's clash with Atletico Madrid on Sunday, though he has lost his regular starting spot under Xavi to 19-year-old Alejandro Balde. Messi, meanwhile, set up one of Kylian Mbappe's two strikes in a 2-1 win over Angers on Friday night.
