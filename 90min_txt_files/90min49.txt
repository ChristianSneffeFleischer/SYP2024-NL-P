Chelsea are close to finalising an agreement with Southampton for the transfer of Romeo Lavia, sources have confirmed to 90min. The Blues have a long-standing interest in the midfielder having tried to sign him last summer just weeks after he first joined the Saints from Manchester City. They continued to monitor Lavia throughout his debut Premier League season, with the teenager breaking into the Belgium senior side despite Southampton's relegation. Liverpool have seen three bids for Lavia rejected by Southampton this summer as they did not meet their  £50m valuation, and the Merseysiders could now be beaten to his signature by Chelsea. feed 90min understands that a deal to take Lavia from St Mary's to Stamford Bridge worth  £55m is close to being agreed, roughly 24 hours after Chelsea reignited their interest in the 19-year-old. Lavia has not made a competitive appearance for Southampton this season due to intense speculation regarding a move away. Chelsea and Liverpool's transfer business in recent days has been intertwined. The Reds appeared to have beaten the Blues to Brighton's Moises Caicedo after launching a British-record  £111m bid on Friday morning, but the Ecuadorian is holding out for a move to west London instead. Though they intend to match Liverpool's mammoth offer in the coming hours, Brighton are yet to receive a new bid from Chelsea. Elsewhere, Chelsea have dropped their interest in Leeds United's Tyler Adams despite agreeing to pay his  £20m relegation release clause this week, with the USMNT captain now returning to Yorkshire.
