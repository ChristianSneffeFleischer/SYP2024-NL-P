Newcastle have confirmed the signing of Italy midfielder Sandro Tonali from AC Milan. The Magpies were looking to bolster in midfield this summer and quickly moved to strike a deal with Milan which 90min understands is worth around  Â£60m. Tonali has inked an initial five-year contract at St James' Park and becomes the second-most expensive signing in Newcastle history, behind only striker Alexander Isak. "First of all, I want to thank Newcastle United because they are giving me a huge opportunity for my career," Tonali said. "I want to repay the trust on the pitch, giving it my all, as I always have. I'm really excited about playing at St. James' Park, I can't wait to feel the warmth of the fans." feed Manager Eddie Howe added: "I'm delighted to welcome Sandro to Newcastle United. "He is an exceptional talent and has the mentality, physicality and technical attributes to be a great fit for us. "At 23, Sandro already has important experience as a key player in one of Europe's top leagues and in the Champions League, as well as playing for his country. "But he also has the opportunity and potential to grow and evolve with us, and I   m excited to add him to our squad as we approach the exciting season ahead."
