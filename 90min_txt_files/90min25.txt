Everton have confirmed the signing of wide midfielder Jack Harrison from Leeds United on a season-long loan deal.  Harrison had yet to feature for Leeds since their relegation to the Championship, missing the club's first two games of the season amid injury and uncertainty about his future, and was also a target for Unai Emery's Aston Villa. But the former Manchester City man has secured a move back to the Premier League with Everton, with a club statement saying of his arrival: "Everton have completed the signing of forward Jack Harrison on a season-long loan from Leeds United. "The 26-year-old passed his medical with the Club yesterday before completing the necessary paperwork this morning. He will now continue his rehabilitation from a minor hip injury before being available for Sean Dyche   s squad. "He becomes Everton   s fourth signing of the summer transfer window following the arrivals of forward Arnaut Danjuma, defender Ashley Young and striker Youssef Chermiti." Harrison had been one of Leeds' standout performers during their three-year stay in the Premier League, scoring 21 league goals for the club. Though he will not take to the field immediately, Everton will hope he can make a swift impact and help the Toffees kick on under Sean Dyche.
