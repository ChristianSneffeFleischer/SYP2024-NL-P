Barcelona vice-president Rafa Yuste has confirmed that Ousmane Dembele is on the verge of completing a move to Paris Saint-Germain. The France international was not expected to leave or push for a move away from Catalonia this summer, but PSG triggered his    50m ( Â£43m) release clause shortly before it expired in July and proceeded to discuss personal terms. During these negotiations, Dembele was called out in public by Barcelona head coach Xavi and club captain Sergi Roberto, who expressed their shock at the sudden move. 90min reported on August 3 that PSG had hoped to wrap up a deal before the end of last week, but a deal has dragged on and reports from the Spanish press suggested talks had stalled. feed But after Dembele was omitted from Barca's squad to take on Tottenham Hotspur in the annual Joan Gamper Trophy on Tuesday night, vice-president Yuste insisted that the transfer will go ahead and confirmation of an agreement is close. "We're on the verge of resolving Dembele deal with Paris Saint-Germain as all parties want to seal it as soon as possible," Yuste said. "Dembele is not with us tonight as we hope to settle the matter soon. We are on it." With money raised from the sales of Dembele and midfielder Franck Kessie, 90min understands that Barcelona will make a fresh move to sign Joao Cancelo, while they remain interested in his Manchester City teammate Bernardo Silva.
