Sergio Aguero remains committed to Barcelona despite the recent exit of countryman Lionel Messi. The former Manchester City man completed his move to Camp Nou earlier this summer, bringing to an end an illustrious ten-year spell with the Premier League outfit. Aguero has previous spoken of his desire to play alongside Messi at club level, though his dreams were shattered on Thursday when Barcelona confirmed the superstar forward would not be signing a new deal at Camp Nou. News of Messi's exit has caused reports to circulate suggesting Aguero no longer wants to play for the Blaugrana, but Sport claim this isn't the case and that he remains committed to the club. The report adds that both Aguero and his family are already settled in Barcelona and as such he's not even considering the possibility of looking for a new club. The news will come as a huge relief to Bar  a following club president Joan Laporta's admission that there's no chance of Messi returning to Camp Nou this summer, as La Liga's giants continue to try and drag their way out of the financial mess they find themselves in. However, Aguero's decision to remain at Camp Nou may not quite be as cut and dry as the Spanish news outlet make out. As is so often the case with such high-profile sagas, a number of conflicting reports have already started to circulate, with Spanish television channel Beteve (via the Daily Mail) claiming Aguero is in fact incensed at Barcelona's inability to tie Messi down to a new deal.
