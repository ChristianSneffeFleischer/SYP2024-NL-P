Real Madrid would still be willing to sign Kylian Mbappe, but only if certain conditions are met. Towards the end of last season, it looked likely that Mbappe would become a player by the start of the 2022/23 campaign, with the Spanish club confident of signing him following talks between the two parties.  However, they were blindsided when, at the last minute, he backed out and decided to remain at Paris Saint-Germain instead, signing a new contract with the Ligue 1 champions.  Real Madrid president Florentino Perez and his colleagues were reportedly furious, feeling that the Frenchman had betrayed them and publicly criticising his behaviour.  Since then, Mbappe has been far from happy at PSG, upset over the fact that the club haven't signed a new striker and are playing him there instead, with him wanting one of the freer roles currently occupied by Neymar and Lionel Messi.  As a result, rumours are once again beginning to swirl over his future, but it's unclear whether Real Madrid would be willing to offer him a deal again following their fallout.  According to Sport though, while many at the club are still angry with him, Perez would still be happy to sign him, but only if certain conditions were met.  The player would have to approach the club asking to join and have to accept that, unlike at PSG, he wouldn't have any more power or influence than his teammates. He would also be expected to take a salary more in line with his colleagues. Upon signing a new contract with Les Parisiens, it was widely reported that Mbappe had been granted a say in the club's sporting activities, including what players to sign and sell.
