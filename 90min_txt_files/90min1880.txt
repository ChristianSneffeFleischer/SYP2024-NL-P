Turkish side Besiktas have confirmed they received    2.825m in compensation after agreeing to terminate Wout Weghorst's loan from Burnley. The Dutchman was on a season-long loan in Turkey when Manchester United came calling, with the Red Devils eventually striking a deal to bring Weghorst to Old Trafford to see out the remaining six months of his loan. As 90min revealed earlier this month, Burnley were happy to send Weghorst to United but informed the Red Devils they would be responsible for compensating Besiktas, who had the option to buy the striker permanently and so had to agree to terminating his contract early. Confirming his departure, Besiktas revealed: "Due to the early termination of the contract by Burnley, a termination fee of    2.825m will be paid to our Company." United are covering Weghorst's wages for the remainder of his loan contract but do not have the option to make the deal permanent at the end of the season.
