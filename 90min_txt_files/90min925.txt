Bayern Munich have confirmed the long-awaited arrival of midfielder Konrad Laimer from RB Leipzig on a free transfer. Laimer was a target for Premier League sides last summer as he approached the end of his contract in Leipzig but Bayern also lodged their interest and have been confident of wrapping up a deal for the Austria international for months. It has been one of the worst-kept secrets in football but now Bayern have finally made Laimer's move to Munich official, tying the 26-year-old down to a four-year contract. "It's a dream come true for me," Laimer said after completing his move. "FC Bayern is one of the biggest clubs in the world.  "I will give everything for the club and the fans. FC Bayern always has the highest goals - just like me. I'm in the right place here. I'm only capable of giving 100%, and that's what I'll put into every training session from day one. I can hardly wait." feed Bayern CEO Jan-Christian Dreesen added: "We are delighted to have signed Konrad Laimer. He comes to us as a two-time DFB Cup winner - and together we will now hopefully celebrate many more great victories and titles here at FC Bayern." Laimer becomes Bayern's first signing of the summer, and the Thomas Tuchel era, and could be followed by a new striker as the Bundesliga champions look to add more firepower in attack. Eintracht Frankfurt's Randal Kolo Muani is seen as a likely target, with Tottenham's Harry Kane expected to be too expensive, although the Frenchman has recently teased a potential move to the Premier League instead. Also heading to England from Germany could be Bayern right-back Benjamin Pavard who, with one year remaining on his contract, has made it clear he would like to leave this summer.
