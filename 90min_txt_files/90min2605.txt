Valencia manager Gennaro Gattuso has confirmed that a deal has been struck to sign Tottenham winger Bryan Gil on loan, but Spurs will not release him until they have signed a replacement. The Spaniard spent the second half of last season on loan with the Mestalla outfit after struggling to break into Antonio Conte's first-team plans, making 17 appearances in all competitions and chipping in with one assist. And Gattuso has revealed that his side are set to secure the 21-year-old's services on a season-long loan - without a purchase option - once Spurs have sourced a replacement. "We have closed a deal for Bryan, Tottenham have told us that it is 99% done," said the Italian. "We have been waiting for him for two or three days.  "Tottenham have told us that they have to sign a replacement so that he can travel. We are waiting for Tottenham to sign another player."
