Liverpool have granted Fabinho permission to travel to Saudi Arabia to undergo a medical with Al Ittihad, sources have told 90min. The midfielder was omitted from the Reds' squad for their pre-season tour of Germany as talks over a summer transfer to the Middle East intensified. 90min reported on Thursday that Liverpool had received a substantial offer from Saudi Pro League champions Al Ittihad for Fabinho. And 90min now understands that the two clubs are now close to agreeing terms over a  £40m deal and Fabinho has already started saying his goodbyes on Merseyside. The 29-year-old is now due in Saudi Arabia for a medical after being given the Reds' blessing to finalise the move. Al Ittihad managed to topple Cristiano Ronaldo's Al Nassr and win last season's Saudi Pro League, while they have added Karim Benzema and N'Golo Kante to their ranks this window. manual Fabinho is not the only Liverpool midfielder who could be heading to Saudi Arabia this summer, with club captain Jordan Henderson also in talks over such a move. The England midfielder is wanted by Steven Gerrard at Al Ettifaq, who are one of the league's few powerhouses not under control by PIF. 90min understands that while Gerrard is pushing hard to get the deal done and there is a confidence an agreement will be reached, Al Ettifaq are currently reluctant to meet Liverpool's  £20m asking price. Henderson is yet to give his total agreement to the deal and is still weighing up the offer despite reports claiming he's agreed terms on a  £700,000-a-week contract.
