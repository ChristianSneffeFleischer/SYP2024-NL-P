Robert Lewandowski has revealed the reasons behind his upcoming move from Bayern Munich to Barcelona, adding that he wants to win titles with his new side. The Poland striker has arrived in Catalonia for a medical after both Bayern and Bar  a confirmed an agreement for the transfer, which is worth around    50m. Having become one of the leading players in Europe following his extraordinary exploits in the Bundesliga, Lewandowski's desire to leave Bayern came as a surprise to many. But he has now explained why the move to La Liga is one he could not turn down. He told Bild: "I wanted to play in another league than the Bundesliga, I had made that decision for a long time. But I have to emphasize: It was the most difficult decision of my life. I wanted to live somewhere else, discover something new with my family. My daughter Klara will start school next year, we had to make a decision. And that decision was that it should be something new. If not now, then that would probably never have been possible. It was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.    Barcelona had problems last season. But the club has incredible potential and has made good transfers now. I think the club is on the right track - back to the top. My goal is very clear to get up there with Bar  a and win trophies!    Bayern had been adamant earlier in the window that Lewandowski would not be sold and tried to dig their heels in to prevent him leaving. The exit has soured the relationship between player and club, but Lewandowski claimed everyone has got what they wanted from the deal.
