Barcelona president Joan Laporta has insisted that the club will make signings in January, despite their well-documented financial problems.  2021 has been a traumatising year for the Blaugrana with the pandemic and chronic over-spending combining to cause major financial disaster. To help balance the books, several high-earners have left Camp Nou in recent times, including Luis Suarez, Antoine Griezmann and Lionel Messi.  Recent reports suggest that further sales are planned in January with first-teamers Marc-Andre ter Stegen, Sergino Dest and even Frenkie de Jong on the transfer list.  However, Laporta has revealed that there are incomings planned as well.  Speaking in a social media clip posted after Barcelona were dumped out of the Champions League courtesy of a 3-0 defeat to Bayern Munich, Laporta said: "I share your disappointment about our elimination from the Champions League. We all agree that we need to reinforce the first team. "The problem is that we have inherited some inflated contracts which don't give us margin with the wage cap. We're working to find a formula to improve the team this winter. We're working to do it, and we will achieve it. "Now, I'm asking you to all work in the same direction in these times for the good of the club." Xavi is particularly keen to strengthen in the forward department. Following the exits of Messi and Griezmann, as well as injuries to Ansu Fati and Martin Braithwaite, Barcelona are weak offensively.  They only netted twice in the Champions League group stages and have been outscored by a host of La Liga sides this season.
