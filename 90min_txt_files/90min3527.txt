Ralf Rangnick has revealed that Manchester United weren't willing to sanction Jesse Lingard's move away from the club late in the January transfer window due to the ongoing police investigation involving Mason Greenwood, while they also didn't receive an acceptable offer from interested clubs. Greenwood was arrested on Sunday on suspicion of rape and assault, and was held in police custody for several days. He was also further arrested on suspicion of sexual assault and threats to kill, before being released on bail on Wednesday. Man Utd have confirmed that Greenwood has been suspended from first-team activities while the investigation is ongoing. The club's media team informed reporters at Rangnick's press conference on Thursday that they would not be taking questions on Greenwood's situation, but the interim coach admitted that the 20-year-old's arrest was a factor in keeping Lingard at Old Trafford. "[There were] two things. One, had a problem with Mason Greenwood and being without a player for the time being. Two, the club couldn   t find an agreement with another club," Rangnick said. 90min reported in January of Newcastle and West Ham's extensive interest in Lingard right up until the transfer deadline, while the player was also upset at being denied a move.
