But Rodgers was clear in a press conference last week that he wants fresh faces to arrive in the east Midlands, when asked whether he had enough depth to compete in four competitions.    No, we don   t. That   s something I   ve been pretty clear on." Rodgers said.    I think our idea this year was to improve the squad. The players in this last season, they   ve shown many great moments, and I think for them to improve, it   s going to need time, and work on the training field. "But also in order to improve, you need quality. That   s something we   ve talked about, and something that we can give the squad in order to help them." Under joined Roma in the summer of 2017 from Istanbul Basaksehir and he's gone on make 88 appearances for the club, scoring 17 goals and providing 12 assists.
