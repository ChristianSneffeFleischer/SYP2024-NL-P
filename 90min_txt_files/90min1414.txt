Gavi has told Barcelona that he has no intention of leaving the club on a free transfer this summer, 90min understands.  The 18-year-old agreed terms on a new four-year contract at Barcelona - which included a    1bn release clause - in September 2022 but the club has yet to formally register the new contract with La Liga.  La Liga blocked the registration of the deal due to the club's recent financial woes and, after the Blaugrana lost a court appeal over the decision, Gavi can now technically leave at the end of his current youth contract in June.  READ NEXT manual Despite this, 90min understands that Gavi does not want to leave the club on a free this summer and is keen to play for Xavi's side beyond the 2022/23 season.  Prior to signing a new deal in September, the talented midfielder rejected advances from Manchester City, Liverpool, Paris Saint-Germain and Bayern Munich. It remains to be seen whether these clubs will re-state their interest in Gavi in the coming months.  Spanish outlet Relevo has reported that, although their appeal was rejected by the court, Barcelona are still confident of getting the Spanish international's new contract registered before his youth contract runs out in June.  The midfielder is seen as one of the pillars around which Xavi's Barcelona will be built, with the club showing their faith in the player by giving him the famed number six jersey earlier this season.
