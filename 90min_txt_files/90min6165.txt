Leicester City hope to begin talks to sign Fenerbahce striker Vedat Muriqi, as Brendan Rodgers looks to bolster his squad ahead of next season. The Kosovo international joined the Turkish giants last summer and scored 15 league goals this season as his side finished a disappointing fifth in the Super Lig. The 26-year-old has previously been linked with a move to the Premier League following impressive performances in Turkey, and came to wider attention when he scored against England European Championship qualifying back in September. Turkish outlet Aksam report that the former   aykur Rizespor man could be on his way to the King Power Stadium this summer, with the Foxes seeking to open talks with the player. The attacker's current contract in Turkey runs until 2023, yet the report suggests he is keen to depart this summer and would cost in the region of    20m. Muriqi was reportedly a target for Manchester United back in January, although it was revealed that neither the player nor his current club were interested in making a deal. Never in a million years did I ever think I would win a Premier League winners medal let alone the Golden Boot...just wow!If this proves anything, it shows you should never ever give up on your dreams, no matter how crazy they may seem! pic.twitter.com/YveNP8ydem The imposing striker has had an impressive season this year, and would offer Rodgers a much-needed striking alternative to Jamie Vardy, with Kelechi Iheanacho not proving quite the coup that the Foxes hoped when he arrived from Manchester City.  Vardy finished the season as the Premier League's top scorer with 23 goals, but Rodgers and the Leicester hierarchy are aware of the need to take some of the goalscoring weight off the 33-year-old     particularly with Leicester competing in next season's Europa League. Muriqi would also potentially be a useful strike partner for Vardy, with his physical presence and hold-up play providing a much needed 'Plan B' for a side that often relies on speed in attack.  A tense end to the Premier League season with the Champions League, relegation and Top Goalscorer final places confirmed!                    - - - #ManchesterUnited #ManUtd #MUFC #Chelsea #CFC #Leicester #LCFC #AstonVilla #AVFC #Bournemouth #AFCB #Watford #WFC #Vardy #Ings #Aubameyang #Sterling #Salah #PremierLeague #PL #EPL #Football
