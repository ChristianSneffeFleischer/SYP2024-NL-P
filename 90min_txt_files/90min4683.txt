Santos wonderkid Kaio Jorge is attracting interest from a host of top clubs including Arsenal and Chelsea, according to reports in Italy. The 19-year-old has broken into the first team in the past 12 months, making 28 appearances in Brazil's Serie A so far and netting four goals. He also featured prominently in Santos' 2020 Copa Libertadores campaign, playing in 12 games including the final, which Palmeiras won 1-0 courtesy of a last-second winner from Breno Lopes.  According to Calcio Mercato, several of Europe's top clubs have been keeping tabs on Jorge's quick rise. Inter are heavily interested but it is said that reports that they have already tied up a deal are wide of the mark. Apparently Santos do not expect an agreement to be struck with Inter unless 'surprises' occur in the coming weeks and months.  The Nerazzurri's failure to get a deal over the line seems to have opened the door for rivals clubs to make a move for Jorge. Chelsea and Arsenal are understood to have already made contact with the player's agent, Giuliano Bertolucci, who also has the likes of Marquinhos, David Neres and Felipe Anderson on his books.
