Chelsea midfielder Jorginho has insisted he wants to stay at Chelsea amid speculation linking him with a transfer away from the club. The Italy international is out of contract in 2023, and his agent Joao Santos has often spoken about his client's supposed desire to return to Serie A at some point in his career - although he recently claimed a stay at Stamford Bridge was the priority for now.  Indeed, 90min understands Chelsea are happy to move Jorginho on this summer amid interest from former boss Maurizio Sarri, who is now at Lazio, as well as long-term admirers Juventus. However, the player has insisted he has no plans to leave west London just yet, although he admitted things can move quickly. "Of course, I love Chelsea," he told the club's official website. "I feel very well here and of course, I   d like to stay. "But you know, there is a lot going on and we don   t know. I am here now and I have contract and I love to be here, I feel very well here. So I don   t think about moving anywhere." He continued: "For many years now [there   s speculation]. Every single year. I don   t think like this. I just think about where I am and focus 100 per cent. I   m at Chelsea and I think about Chelsea 100 per cent.
