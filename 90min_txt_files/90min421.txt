Manchester City winger Riyad Mahrez remains the subject of intense transfer interest from Saudi Pro League side Al Ahli, sources have told 90min. The 32-year-old lost his place as a starter towards the end of the 2022/23 season and was unhappy at being overlooked for Man City's wins in the FA Cup and Champions League finals, remaining an unused substitute in both fixtures. 90min revealed that Mahrez was in contact with Al Ahli towards the end of June, with the club willing to pay him  Â£45m-a-year. He is open to such a move. As was the case last month though, Man City remain reluctant to let Mahrez leave, with Bernardo Silva's increasingly uncertain future a major factor. The Portugal international has asked to be granted a summer transfer and PSG are keen to make him one of Luis Enrique's first signings. Another player that is on Saudi Arabia's radar is out-of-favour Man City centre-back Aymeric Laporte. 90min previously reported that Laporte was being eyed by Aston Villa and Tottenham Hotspur, but Man City have not received any major offers from clubs in Europe. With interest from across the continent yet to be firmed up, Man City are ready to sell him to willing buyers from Saudi Arabia, with Al Ahli ready to offer him an exit route. Al Ahli are also targeting Napoli midfielder Piotr Zielinski, who is wanted by Lazio as a replacement for Al Hilal-bound Sergej Milinkovic-Savic. feed
