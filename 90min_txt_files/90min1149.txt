The father of Lionel Messi has released a statement hitting back at reports that his son has agreed a lucrative deal to join a club in Saudi Arabia. Reports in France have claimed that Messi has already accepted terms to sign for a team in the Saudi Pro League upon the expiration of his PSG contract this summer. 90min understands that while Al Hilal are confident of securing Messi's signature, former club Barcelona feel the same way, though nothing is close to being finalised yet. And Jorge Messi has released a statement insisting that his son has indeed not decided upon his future yet, lashing out at reporting which states that he has. READ MORE FROM THE 90MIN TALKING TRANSFERS TEAM feed "There is absolutely nothing with any club for next year. The decision will never be made before Lionel ends the league with PSG," he said. "Once the season is over it will be time to analyse and see what is there, and then make a decision. "There are always rumours and many use the name of Lionel to gain notoriety but the truth is only one and we can assure that there is nothing with anyone. Neither verbal, nor signed, nor agreed, and there will not be until the end of the season. "It seems to me a lack of respect, that there are those who consciously and deliberately deceive, without providing proof of any of their claims, and wanting to turn any malicious rumour into news or that is directed by someone in favour of their interests. They would have to explain that they do not contrast the information...they will not want a truth to ruin their 'news'." LISTEN NOW
