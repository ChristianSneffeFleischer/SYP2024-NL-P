West Ham have confirmed the permanent signing of Tomas Soucek from Slavia Prague on a four-year deal, after a successful period at the club on loan. The Hammers have successfully avoided relegation to the second tier with some impressive displays of late, much of which has been attributed to the fine form of the Czech international. He's here to stay!     #Soucek2024 pic.twitter.com/tUxAtRRoDT An initial loan move from his homeland included an option to buy at the end of the season, with David Moyes seeing fit to award the midfielder with a permanent stay in the Premier League, as confirmed by the club's official website. Moyes said of the deal:    I   m delighted that Tomas has signed his permanent contract to secure his long-term future at the Club. When I came in, we talked about needing another midfield player, to help Declan Rice and Mark Noble, and I think he   s been a really good fit for us.    He   s a terrific lad with very good physical capabilities. He has scored some really important goals for us, against Chelsea, Newcastle and Watford. We   re glad he   s going to be a West Ham player for a good period to come." Soucek caught the eye of European sides during this season's Champions League group stages, where some valiant displays in the heart of midfield saw Slavia Prague earn plaudits from their 'group of death' with Barcelona, Borussia Dortmund and Inter.  What a performance and what an important 3 point for us ??
