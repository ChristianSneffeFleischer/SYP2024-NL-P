Jorginho's agent has revealed he's been contacted about the midfielder's availability, though his priority is to secure a new deal at Chelsea. The Italian has been one of the standout performers at Euro 2020, with some even claiming he deserves to be in the running for the Ballon d'Or after reaching the final of this summer's competition little over a month after being crowned a Champions League winner. With Jorginho's stock currently the highest it's ever been, his agent Joao Santos was asked if there had been contact from other clubs about a possible move away from west London. And despite confirming there had been an approach from at least one unnamed club, Santos added that his priority is opening talks with Chelsea director Marina Granovskaia over a new deal for his client. "Yes [there's been contact from other clubs], but our first thought is to speak to Marina Granovskaia about the renewal," he told Radio Marte (via Metro). "This is certainly a very important moment in his career, he has been waiting for it for 20 years." While Santos' comments seemed to suggest Jorginho was intent on staying at Stamford Bridge beyond this summer, the agent then went on to cast doubt over his client's future by discussing how sought-after the midfielder will be this summer. "Today, Jorginho   s valuation is around    50m ( Â£42.8m)," he added. "If a team arrives    obviously he has made it to many finals."
