Tanguy Kouassi has decided to join Bayern Munich as a free agent this summer after rejecting a professional contract from PSG.  The 18-year-old rose to prominence following a stellar Under-17 World Cup campaign with France in 2019 and was handed several opportunities in the first team by Thomas Tuchel last season.  Kouassi made 13 appearances for PSG last term; scoring three times and persistently showing off his talent in both centre-back and defensive midfield roles, also becoming the youngest player to represent the club in the  Champions League  with a start against Galatasaray  in December.  Despite the opportunities presented by Tuchel, Kouassi opted against signing a long-term deal with Les Parisiens and after Arsenal, Barcelona, RB Leipzig, Dortmund and Milan all emerged as potential destinations, Fabrizio Romano has confirmed the teenager will join Bayern this summer.  Romano reports a 'total agreement' has been reached between club and player, while PSG directors have been left 'furious' at Kouassi's decision to turn down a new deal at the Parc des Princes. The French giants had discussed a potential extension with Kouassi's entourage for months, while the club were still hopeful of wrapping up a deal as recently as last month.  Nevertheless, it's understood Die Roten are keen to sign someone versatile enough to play both centre-back and number six roles to a high standard. And overall, securing the Frenchman on a free transfer is an incredibly astute bit of business amid the financial uncertainty brought about by COVID-19.  The Bavarians, of course, are also chasing big-money deals for Leroy Sane and Kai Havertz, while a new right-back is also said to be high up on their list of priorities this summer.
