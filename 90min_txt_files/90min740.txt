Newcastle United are progressing with talks to land AC Milan midfielder Sandro Tonali, sources have confirmed to 90min. The 23-year-old Italy international has emerged as Newcastle's top defensive midfield target and they are moving ahead a deal after the player's camp communicated his interest in making the move. Previous interest in Nicolo Barella at city rivals Inter cooled after it emerged he was not looking to head to the Premier League, leaving Tonali to emerge as the man they want. Tonali is considered with of Italy's best defensive midfielders and is captaining his country at the European Under-21 Championship being staged in Georgia and Romania. Tonali still has four years left on the Milan contract he signed in 2022, but Newcastle are ready to offer him a significant pay rise should he put pen to paper on Tyneside. feed With Tonali giving the green light, talks have quickly progressed since Tuesday and 90min understands that Magpies director of football Dan Ashworth is currently in Italy to oversee a possible deal as the two clubs are now talking over the terms of a transfer. Newcastle are looking to finalise the move for less than  Â£60m, although with add-ons it is eventually expected to be around that mark. Newcastle majority shareholders PIF are determined to provide manager Eddie Howe with a squad capable of  competing at the top of the Premier League and in the Champions League, having sealed their return to Europe's top table, and Tonali is set to be the first of a number of new additions. As well as a new defensive midfielder, Newcastle also want a versatile number 10, with James Maddison already identified for that role and talks onging with Leicester for him. In additiona, they ideally want a new left-back, a right-sided centre-back and a wide forward.
