Chelsea defender Cesar Azpilicueta is closing in on a move to Serie A side Inter, 90min understands. The fan-favourite has fallen down the pecking order since the emergence of Reece James and came close to leaving Chelsea last year amid interest from Barcelona, only to sign a new contract at Stamford Bridge. With January signing Malo Gusto set to arrive at Stamford Bridge this summer to provide more competition for James, Azpilicueta has been told he is free to leave Chelsea and sources have confirmed to 90min that he is closing in on a move to Inter. Azpilicueta, 33, has spoken with Bayern Munich and also received interest from Saudi Arabia but is set to take his talents to Inter, who have agreed the terms of a two-year contract with the right-back. Despite still having one year remaining on his deal at Chelsea, Azpilicueta is expected to be granted a free transfer as a sign of respect for his 11 years of service. feed Azpilicueta joined from Marseille in 2012 to very little fanfare but soon established himself as an integral part of Chelsea's defence, featuring on both the right and left and even transitioning into a centre-back later in his career. In total, Azpilicueta has racked up 508 outings for Chelsea, putting him sixth on the club's all-time appearance charts, and Blues officials are keen to reward that loyalty by granting him a free transfer. Chelsea and Inter have been locked in negotiations all summer over a range of issues. While the Blues have backed away from a deal for goalkeeper Andre Onana, talks remain ongoing over striker Romelu Lukaku. Lukaku spent last season on loan with Inter and is determined to return. Chelsea are pushing for a permanent sale but Inter can only afford a loan and so work is being done to try and thrash out an agreement which benefits everyone.
