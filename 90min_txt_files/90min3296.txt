Erling Haaland has credited his father Alf-Inge for helping him fall in love with Manchester City. Alf-Inge moved to England in 1993 and eventually joined City in 2000, playing 45 times for the club before a nasty knee injury, which was aggravated by an infamous challenge from Roy Keane in a Manchester derby, forced him into an early retirement in 2003. The younger Haaland, who was born in Leeds in 2000 just a month after his father left the Whites in favour of a move to City, has now admitted that the chance to follow in Alf-Inge's footsteps was behind his decision to join the club 22 years and one day after this father.    First of all, my father, a little bit,    he told the club of his reasons for signing.    I was born in England. I have been a City fan my whole life. I know a lot about the club.    In the end, [deciding to sign was down to] two things. I feel at home here and I feel I can develop and get the best out of my game at City.    I like the style [of play]. I like the attacking football. I like the positive vibe we have when City play football. This is what I like a lot, so I think it   s a good fit.    Haaland also admitted that the chance to work with Pep Guardiola was too intriguing to turn down.    I think I can develop a lot under Pep and in this club,    he continued.    I think I can get better on a lot of things and hopefully I can score a lot." Listen now to 90min's brand new podcast,  Talking Transfers, with  Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  &  Toby Cudworth.
