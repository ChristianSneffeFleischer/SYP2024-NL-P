The January transfer window of 2022 came to a close on Monday, with 14 players completing moves to Premier League clubs in the final 24 hours of business. Among the deals were high-profile captures, young players bought for potential and gambles on former stars, and there is sure to be a mixed bag of results when they get onto the pitch. Here   s a closer look at all 14 deadline day deals in the Premier League, ranked from worst to best. Transfer: PermanentFrom: FleetwoodFee: UndisclosedBilly Crellin was a teammate of Phil Foden and Jadon Sancho when England won the Under-17 World Cup in 2017, but his senior club career hasn't really taken off in the four and a bit years since that triumph.The goalkeeper was on loan at Bolton last season but hadn't really played for Fleetwood in the first half of this campaign. Overall, he lacks senior experience and isn't likely to get that at Everton. Transfer: PermanentFrom: Colorado RapidsFee: FreeArsenal raided the American market twice in the January transfer window, first landing goalkeeper Matt Turner, before also sealing the arrival of Auston Trusty and then loaning him back to Colorado Rapids.Trusty is a four-year veteran of Major League Soccer with Philadelphia Union and Colorado, but he is 23 and not capped at senior international level. This is a move that may ultimately benefit him more than Arsenal. Transfer: PermanentFrom: MainzFee:  £9mHaving initially signed Jean-Philippe Mateta on loan last January, Crystal Palace renegotiated their option to buy with Mainz - reducing the figure from  £12.5m to  £9m - and brought it forward.The Frenchman has only recently enjoyed a run of games in the Palace side after a similarly fringe role in the second half of last season. But his goal tally in the Premier League this season stands at just one. Transfer: PermanentFrom: TottenhamFee: Free plus up to  £40m in add-onsDele Alli has an awful lot to prove after struggling for consistent form since 2018, but a permanent transfer to Everton will at least provide him with the chance to do that.At his very best a few years ago, Dele was among the top goalscoring midfielders in Europe and, at 25, still has time on his side. It could be a masterstroke if he gets back to that level...but it is a huge if. Transfer: PermanentFrom: JuventusFee:  £15.8m plus up to  £5m in add-onsTottenham don't have the best recent record when it comes to high-profile international midfielders - i.e. Tanguy Ndombele and Giovani Lo Celso, both of whom have now left on loan.Fans will hope Rodrigo Bentancur doesn't get added to that list. His price tag has the potential to be a steal in the long-term but it might also be worth asking why Juventus let him go for relatively cheap. Transfer: Loan (end of season)From: Aston VillaFee: UndisclosedMatt Targett played 38 Premier League games for Aston Villa last season and almost every game in the first half of this season. But he immediately lost his place to new Villa left-back Lucas Digne.The 26-year-old is an underwhelming signing by the standards Newcastle fans were hoping for - Digne was a target before going to Villa - but is proven at this level and adds squad depth and competition. Transfer: PermanentFrom: DerbyFee:  £1mCrystal Palace have picked up a potentially very good prospect for the future in Derby talent Luke Plange and have paid only a minimal fee to the cash-strapped Championship side.A striker, Plange has posted impressive numbers both at Under-23 level in Premier League 2 and at first-team level in the Championship this season. He will finish the campaign on loan with Derby. Transfer: PermanentFrom: Union Saint-GilloiseFee:  £6mUnion Saint-Gilloise have been storming the Belgian league this season and are leading the title race by some distance, despite only getting promoted back to the top flight in the summer. Deniz Undav has been a huge reason.Brighton have sent the prolific German back on loan to Union for the rest of the season. But the Seagulls tend to recruit unknown gems really well and at  £6m, Undav could be another shrewd move. Transfer: PermanentFrom: BrightonFee:  £13mFunctional is perhaps the best way to describe Dan Burn's arrival at Newcastle, which also marks a homecoming of sorts for the towering centre-back after he was released by the club at the age of 11.If Burn, who played 74 times in the Premier League for Brighton since his 2019 debut, helps keep the Magpies in the top flight, his transfer will have been a success. He is also an upgrade on existing options. Transfer: PermanentFrom: WolfsburgFee:  £12mDutch striker Wout Weghorst is potentially an upgrade for Burnley on Chris Wood, but was bought for considerably less than the New Zealander was sold to Newcastle for earlier in the January window.Having averaged 0.89 goals per game in the Premier League so far this season, Burnley desperately need to start finding the back of the net. If they give 6'6 Weghorst decent service, he could start firing. Transfer: Loan (18 months)From: JuventusFee:  £8.3mEven if Dejan Kulusevski takes the remainder of this season to settle at Tottenham and be moulded by Antonio Conte, an 18-month loan until the summer of 2023 for a minimal fee has lots of potential for success.The Sweden starlet is still only 21 and showed enough while a teenager at Parma to prompt Juventus to agree a transfer worth up to    44m. Things fizzled out in Turin, but Kulusevski is a talent to watch. Transfer: Loan (end of season)From: Manchester UnitedFee:  £500,000Manchester United didn't make the most of Donny van de Beek, having been widely praised for their 2020 capture of the former Ballon d'Or nominee - a nod secured for his performances in Ajax's famous 2019 Champions League run.In increasingly sparse appearances over the last 18 months, his confidence has been drained. Find a way to restore that and Everton potentially have a very good player on their hands for the next few months. Transfer: PermanentFrom: River PlateFee:  £14mManchester City rarely miss in the transfer market. Even if their acquisitions take a little time to come good, such as Joao Cancelo, most in recent years have proven to be a home run swing.Julian Alvarez will remain at River Plate until at least July 2022, but he comes with a rapidly growing reputation as a Copa Libertadores and Copa America winner and is reigning South American Footballer of the Year.
