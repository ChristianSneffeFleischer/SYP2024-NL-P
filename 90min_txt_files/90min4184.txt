Inter Miami have signed U.S. youth international Indiana Vassilev on loan from English Premier League side Aston Villa.  The midfielder is set to join the American team for the rest of the 2021 Major League Soccer season, pending the receipt of his International Transfer Certificate.   The American player marks Inter Miami   s first move of the Secondary Transfer Window that commenced on Wednesday. His versatility on the pitch gives head coach Phil Neville much-needed options on the attack as regular Rodolfo Pizarro remains sidelined due to injury.        Indiana is an exciting young talent who has a lot of potential,    said Chris Henderson, Inter Miami CF Chief Soccer Officer and Sporting Director.    He   s comfortable and confident on the ball and fluid with his movement. We feel this is the right place for Indiana to further his development and reach his potential.    Vassilev first joined the English team at youth level in 2018, representing the Under-18 and Under-21 teams. During that time, he recorded 11 goals and six assists in 54 appearances. He finally made his senior debut for Aston Villa in January 2020 after coming off the bench in an FA Cup game against Fulham. He registered six appearances for the first team in all competitions last season.     Official: Welcome Indiana Vassilev   ?#InterMiamiCF signs U.S. Youth International Vassilev on loan .
