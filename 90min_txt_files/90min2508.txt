Barcelona have assured Bernardo Silva that he is their top transfer target for 2023 and they will push ahead with a deal as soon as they can, sources have told 90min. The Spanish giants made a move for Silva late in the summer window and they even agreed personal terms with the 28-year-old. 90min revealed at the time that City were standing firm on Silva and had no intention of letting him leave, just months after he agreed a contract extension at the Etihad. Silva was keen to join the new Barca project under Joan Laporta and Xavi, which has already made waves this summer with a host of new signings, headlined by Robert Lewandowski. Despite a significant effort from Barcelona, City were unrelenting in their stance and sources close to the Premier League giants have confirmed that they were less than impressed with the situation, but Pep Guardiola is now looking to the future with Silva in his team. Nevertheless, Barcelona have Silva firmly in their thoughts and they plan to reignite their pursuit of the Portugal international next summer, while sources with knowledge of the negotiations have also revealed to 90min that a January bid cannot be ruled out. Barcelona have never been shy about discussing their interest in Silva, with manager Xavi recently admitting he 'loves' the midfielder.
