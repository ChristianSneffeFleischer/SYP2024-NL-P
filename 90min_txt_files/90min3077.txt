Wayne Rooney has spoken with former teammate Jesse Lingard about bringing the player to DC United, 90min understands. Lingard is a free agent following the expiration of his contract with Manchester United, where he played alongside Rooney 44 times between 2014 and 2017, winning Europa League, FA Cup, and EFL Cup titles. Rooney was named DC United head coach earlier this week, but has serious work to do on a team sitting bottom of the overall MLS standings with just one win in their last 10 matches across all competitions - a run that includes a recent 7-0 defeat to the Philadelphia Union. 90min sources confirm Rooney has reached out to Lingard about the possibility of reuniting at Audi Field.  The England international midfielder has received offers from Premier League clubs West Ham and Everton, as reported by 90min, but it's thought neither has yet met the player's salary expectations. Another source told 90min Lingard is one of a large number of players Rooney has contacted to gauge interest in moving to the four-time MLS Cup champions.
