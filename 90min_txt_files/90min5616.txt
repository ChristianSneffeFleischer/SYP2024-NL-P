Leicester City's improved bid to sign AS Saint-Etienne centre-back Wesley Fofana has been rejected by the Ligue 1 club. The Foxes have held a long-term interest in signing Fofana, who was reportedly available this summer. However, according to L'Equipe, Leicester's latest offer of    32m ( Â£29.5m) has been knocked back by the Ligue 1 side. The bid, which was made on Monday night, is Leicester's third offer to AS Saint-Etienne for the centre-back, and even included a 10% sell-on clause. Leicester have signed Cengiz   nder after medicals completed today and are working to sign a new CB. Wesley Fofana is still the main target but St   tienne are not accepting any negotiation.Jonathan Tah is a serious option. #LCFC ready to open talks with Leverkusen. ? #transfers https://t.co/1DWFs5iowN Former Leicester manager Claude Puel is the current man in charge of Fofana at Les Verts, and is said to be a big fan of the youngster. The 19-year-old also signed a new deal with the French side in April, hence why Les Verts are reluctant to let him leave so soon after committing his future to the club. Fofana has played a key role in AS Saint-Etienne's opening fixtures of the new campaign. The centre-back helped keep clean sheets in the first three matches, before the side recently drew 2-2 with Nantes - a game Fofana missed due to a knee injury. With the Foxes taking part in the UEFA Europa League this season, manager Brendan Rodgers has expressed his concerns over squad depth in a recent press conference. He said: "No we don't [have the squad depth] and that's something I've been clear on. "When we lost players of quality last season we didn't have enough depth. Hopefully, in the following weeks we'll have more clarity.
