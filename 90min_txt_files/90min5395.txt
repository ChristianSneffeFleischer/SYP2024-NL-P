Leicester City are understood to have turned down the opportunity to sign Manchester United new boy Alex Telles. The Foxes made no secret of their desire to bolster their full-back options earlier this summer following the departure of Ben Chilwell to Chelsea in a deal believed to be worth  £50m. Timothy Castagne was the man tasked with filling the void left by Chilwell, however, The Athletic claim that prior to the Atalanta left-back's arrival at King Power Stadium, Porto had attempted to offload Telles to Leicester - only for Brendan Rodgers to rebuff the proposal. Castagne wasn't the only full-back above Telles on Rodgers' wish list, with Ajax's Nicolas Tagliafico  also said to have been pinpointed as one of the club's primary targets. Following a tedious transfer saga the Brazilian eventually signed for United for  £15.4m, with boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer describing the 27-year-old as 'exactly what we are looking for'. Having arrived in Portugal in 2016 Telles went on to make nearly 200 appearances for the Primeira Liga champions, notching 13 goals and 49 assists in all competitions. Despite a slow start to the transfer window United enjoyed a flurry of late activity, eventually welcoming five new faces to Old Trafford including Edinson Cavani and Donny van de Beek.
