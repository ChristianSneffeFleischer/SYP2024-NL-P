Manchester City will demand    70m ( £60m) for winger Ferran Torres, who is wanted by Barcelona in January. Barcelona chief Mateu Alemany was in Manchester earlier in the week to hold talks over a possible deal for Torres, who is understood to have already agreed personal terms with the La Liga side. Financial restraints mean Barcelona cannot afford a permanent transfer just yet and are instead eyeing a loan with a view to a permanent deal, but Marca state that City are not interested in that whatsoever. City do not want to lose Torres in January and have made it clear to Barcelona they would need to come up with  £60m to make them even consider a sale. With City standing firm, this deal is expected to be dead as Barcelona simply do not have the money needed to sign Torres. This is the second time that Barcelona have been knocked back by City in recent weeks. Their initial target had been winger Raheem Sterling, who is equally as keen to head to Camp Nou, but the Premier League champions are reluctant to let him go. The situation is clear: City will sell their players if Barcelona pay up, but Barcelona cannot afford to pay up.
