Lautaro Martinez has committed his future to Inter and insisted he is only focused on becoming a 'bandiera' at the club. The Argentine forward has enjoyed a bright start to the season, racking up 10 goal contributions from 15 games so far, but has never been too far away from speculation linking him with a move away from the club. His continually impressive form has prompted new rumours linking him with the likes of Bayern Munich, Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester United, but it appears the prospect of a transfer is at the back of his mind for the time being. Speaking to RaiSport after Inter's win over Fiorentina at the weekend, he stated: "I am doing well [at Inter] and I am happy. I hope to become a    bandiera    in the future. "I have a contract and I am only thinking about Inter. There are a lot of objectives upcoming and I hope to continue on this path."
