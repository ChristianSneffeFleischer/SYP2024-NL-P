Aaron Ramsey's unspectacular Juventus career has taken another downward turn after a video of him signing a fan's piece of paper with the words 'contract termination' on it went viral. The Welshman has made 70 appearances for the Bianconeri over the last three seasons, though fell out of favour under the returning Massimiliano Allegri last year and spent the second half of the campaign on loan at Rangers. He notably missed the decisive spot kick in the Scottish side's Europa League final penalty shootout loss to Eintracht Frankfurt. 90min revealed earlier this summer hometown club Cardiff City were exploring the feasibility of Ramsey returning to the Welsh capital alongside Gareth Bale, who has since joined MLS club LAFC. There have also been reports that Juventus are looking to terminate Ramsey's contract at the Allianz Stadium if only to free up some room on their wage bill, particularly with Paul Pogba and Angel Di Maria joining. A Juve fan has even tried to take matters into his own hands, with Ramsey accidentally signing a piece of paper which read 'recissione contrattuale', which translates to 'contract termination'. #Ramsey ha firmato                      Average Juventino Guy (https://t.co/lrr3Ppoktj) pic.twitter.com/MOvy0y5Qjb
