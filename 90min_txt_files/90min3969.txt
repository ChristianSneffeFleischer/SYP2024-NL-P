Tottenham Hotspur have stepped up their pursuit of Fiorentina forward Dusan Vlahovic after losing hope of signing Lautaro Martinez.   The 21-year-old   s performances have been attracting plenty of interest from across Europe this summer.  Vlahovic enjoyed a prolific 2020/21 season, netting 21 goals in 37 Serie A appearances and providing two assists.  Spurs are one club in the race and, according to the The Express, they have 'intensified' negotiations with the player after it became clear that Martinez would not be leaving Inter.   As 90min reported on Monday, the Argentine was open to a move to both Tottenham and north London rivals Arsenal. The Nerazzurri   s Scudetto-winning side has been raided this summer with manager Antonio Conte, Romelu Lukaku and Achraf Hakimi all departing.   This turmoil had left Martinez frustrated, convincing him to consider leaving too. However, Inter would block any move and the player   s agent has publicly said that his client is happy in Milan. The news is a blow to Spurs, who had previously agreed a  £60m deal for Martinez before Lukaku was sold to Chelsea for a club-record fee.   Tottenham are still keen on recruiting a forward and Vlahovic could be the ideal alternative. Spurs have already been in contact with his agent for over a week but they will face stiff competition, with Atletico Madrid alreading tabling an offer of around  £45m. Arsenal have also been credited with an interest, although their priority remains signing a goalkeeper and creative midfielder.
