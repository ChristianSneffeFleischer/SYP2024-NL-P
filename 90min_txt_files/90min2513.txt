Wolves are closing in on the signing of former Chelsea striker Diego Costa on a free transfer, 90min understands, but a deal is subject to a stringent medical. The 33-year-old has been without a club since terminating his contract with Brazilian side Atletico Mineiro in January. He could be set for a return to football with Wolves, who are on the hunt for a new striker after new signing Sasa Kalajdzic - who only joined the club on deadline day - suffered an ACL injury on his debut, ruling him for most, if not all, of the season. That search quickly led them to Costa, and though it was previously thought he would first go on trial with the club, 90min now understands that he will be offered a contract until the end of the season, but only after a lengthy medical check. Costa's fitness record during his days at Chelsea and Atletico Madrid wasn't ideal, and there would understandably be concerns regarding his sharpness having not played a competitive game of football all year. Wolves don't want to be in a situation where a new striker would need to take an extended period of time to get up to speed. Besides Kalajdzic, Wolves' only other senior centre forward is Raul Jimenez, though the likes of Goncalo Guedes and Daniel Podence are capable of playing through the middle.
