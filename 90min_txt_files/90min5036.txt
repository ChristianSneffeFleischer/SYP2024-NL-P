Liverpool have completed the signing of 16-year-old Celta Vigo defender Stefan Bajcetic, pipping Manchester United to his signature in the process. The youngster had been tipped for a move to Old Trafford, with recent reports suggesting that negotiations were underway between United and the teenager ahead of a potential January move. However, The Athletic report that Liverpool have been working 'around the clock' in order to secure a move for the teenager, and they have now rubber stamped the deal which importantly has been done prior to 1 January - when the new Brexit regulations come into place. The Merseyside outfit were understood to have been tracking the progress of Bajcetic since 2019, with a    250,000 ( £224,000) fee now agreed for the young central defender. With both Premier League behemoths vying for the Celta Vigo man's signature, he's understood to have opted for a move to Liverpool on the basis that a number of the club's academy staff were involved in the discussions, including academy director Alex Inglethorpe, assistant academy director Nick Marshall and Under-23s coach Barry Lewtas. Liverpool are also understood to have completed the signing of Birmingham City left-back Calum Scanlon. The England Under-15 international is believed to be costing the Reds a fee of  £500,000, as they look to bolster their academy ranks. A post shared by Calum Scanlon (@calumscanlon) The youngster took to Instagram to express his delight at having signed for the Premier League champions, writing the following message: "Happy to sign with Liverpool FC. A big thank you to BCFC and everyone who has helped me progress to this point, but as of today I start a new chapter. The hard work continues, let   s go!"
