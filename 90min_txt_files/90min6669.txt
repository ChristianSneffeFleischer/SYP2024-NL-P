Manchester United could be ready to offer Welsh star Daniel James a lucrative new contract before offering him the chance to continue his development elsewhere next season.  The 22-year-old winger has made 37 appearances in all competitions during his first Premier League season, impressing particularly in the early stages.  According to The Sun, with Man Utd heavily linked with targets like Borussia Dortmund's Jadon Sancho and Aston Villa's Jack Grealish, it looks possible that James will be shipped out on loan next season in order to continue getting regular game time. There are no specific details on what James' 'bumper' new contract offer will be worth - his current deal runs until 2024, with option to add an extra year - while there is also no mention of which teams would be interested in a loan move. Signed from Championship side Swansea City last summer for  Â£15m, James enjoyed a successful start to his Old Trafford career, scoring three goals in his first four league matches, including during the empathic 4-0 drubbing of Chelsea on the opening day of the season.  But since the turn of the year, James' form had dipped and he was in and out of the side with the emergence of Mason Greenwood and a change of formation, the causes.  James still has the time to remind manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer of his qualities as a first-team player for the here and now, with the Premier League season set to resume on 19 June.  United's first match will be away against Tottenham Hotspur. Anthony Martial needs to make an impact at Old Trafford soon! |        @mitchwilks
