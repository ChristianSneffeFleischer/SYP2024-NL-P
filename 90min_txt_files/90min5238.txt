Tottenham boss Jose Mourinho has admitted midfielder Gedson Fernandes may cut short his nightmare loan deal in January and return to parent club Benfica. The 21-year-old arrived at White Hart Lane in January 2019 on an 18-month loan agreement which runs until the summer of 2021 and the Premier League side were able to insert an option to buy into the deal. However, despite being incredibly highly-rated in Portugal, he has failed to live up to expectations in England and has subsequently been left out of Spurs' 25-man Europa League squad. It appears his time in north London may be coming to a premature end, with Mourinho admitting to Sport TV (as cited by Sky Sports) he is willing to 'end the relationship', should Benfica decide to recall their youngster in the winter window. He said: "For me it is never a problem, but a solution. Having him in the squad, even if he is not called up and not playing, is an extremely comfortable situation. "I will never be the one to push him or say that I don't want him here. But I understand the situation of the kid and Benfica. "If the club wants to end the relationship here, we will be here to collaborate, because we want the good of the player. Benfica has the power to decide and will be accepted by us."
