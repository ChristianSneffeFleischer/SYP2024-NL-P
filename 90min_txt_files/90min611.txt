Aston Villa have agreed a deal with Villarreal worth around  Â£35m for Pau Torres, with the Spaniard now due to undergo a medical, sources have confirmed to 90min. The 26-year-old, who has just one year remaining on his contract, quickly emerged as Unai Emery's number one defensive target and talks have accelerated over the past few weeks. 90min revealed at the beginning of June that Villa were looking at both Torres and Manchester City's Aymeric Laporte, with the intention of strengthening Emery's backline ahead of a return to European competition next season. Sources have now confirmed to 90min that a deal has been agreed for Torres, who also drew interest from Juventus and Bayern Munich, and he is set to ink a five-year contract to join his former manager at Villa Park. Torres will now undergo a medical and Villa hope the deal will be completed before the weekend. Should all go to plan, he'll become Villa's second signing of the summer after Youri Tielemans joined on a free transfer from recently relegated Leicester City. feed The incomings are unlikely to stop there. 90min understands that Emery will be given an expansive budget this summer, with the former Arsenal and PSG boss having overseen a remarkable turnaround since taking charge at the club - Villa veered away from a relegation battle to qualify for the Conference League after finishing 7th in the Premier League. "The club is working to improve also and to take all we need to improve and to do our way," Emery said last month. "And also we have a lot of players with the possibility to improve and grow up with us. I am positive for our future, creating our way and getting better in our way. "We need to add some new players to give us some situations we can improve."
