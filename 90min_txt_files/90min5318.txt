Arsenal defender Shkodran Mustafi has denied claims that he's seeking a move away from the club next summer, although talks over a new contract are yet to get underway. Mustafi's endured a fairly tumultuous career in north London thus far, with frighteningly frequent lapses in concentration often undermining and overshadowing impressive performances at the heart of the Gunners' defence. The 28-year-old has played under four managers at the Emirates since his 2016 switch from Valencia, notching 143 appearances in the process.  However, the five-year deal which he signed upon his arrival will expire at the end of the season, and Mustafi, despite reports suggesting he'd already rejected an extension, has said it'd "mean a lot" should he stay at the Emirates beyond 2021.    When I made a decision to sign for Arsenal it is because I respect this club. It is a huge club, that's why for me if I could stay at Arsenal, of course, it would mean a lot to me,    he said (via the Evening Standard). The German, though, confirmed that no talks are yet to take place over a new contract:    We haven't been talking about anything so there isn't anything I can tell you guys." After being thrust to the periphery during Unai Emery's ill-fated reign, Mikel Arteta has re-introduced the German to the fold. 14 of Mustafi's 15 Premier League appearances last term came under Arteta, and he earned his first minutes of 2020/21 against Leicester at the weekend after recovering from a lengthy knee injury.
