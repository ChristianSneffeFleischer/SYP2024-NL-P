Chelsea are set to make a fresh offer for Juventus star Federico Chiesa in the coming months, after the Blues saw their advances knocked back in the summer. Thomas Tuchel tried to follow up his Serie A raid of Romelu Lukaku by snatching another of the league's best talents, but the Bianconeri rejected a bid of    100m, stating that their talisman is 'untouchable'.  But Juve's reluctance to lose such a hot prospect has not diminished Chelsea's desire to sign Chiesa, and Calcio Mercato reports that the Blues are readying another mega offer to try and lure the Euro 2020 winner to Stamford Bridge.  They're not the only club keeping tabs on the winger's progress, either. Liverpool and Bayern Munich are both keen to land the former Fiorentina star, meaning the Old Lady could be forced to fend off interest from all over Europe. Chelsea would certainly be an attractive destination for Chiesa, having seen Lukaku land his dream move back to west London and hit the ground running in the Premier League. The champions of Europe are riding the crest of a wave at the moment, and are considered one of the favourites to lift the Premier League trophy at the end of the season.  Owner Roman Abramovich has invested heavily in the playing squad in recent transfer windows, and tried to add Chiesa to his ranks last summer. They made a surprise approach for the Italian, but Juve were not willing to entertain any bids.
