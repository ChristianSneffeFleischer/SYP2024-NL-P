Cristiano Ronaldo has given the Juventus hierarchy the go ahead to sign Wolves striker Raul Jimenez in the summer, despite interest from his former club Manchester United. Wolves enjoyed another hugely impressive season under Nuno Espirito Santo, but concluded their campaign with nothing tangible to show for it, having missed out on European football for 2020/21 after finishing seventh in the Premier League and exiting the Europa League at the quarter final stage. The Midlands outfit may have a fight on their hands to keep hold of the very best talent at the club, and Jimenez - who scored 27 goals in all competitions last season - is thought to be in the crosshairs of both Manchester United and Juventus. According to Italian news outlet Gazzetta dello Sport [via the Express], Ronaldo has given Juventus the green light to sign Jimenez as his strike partner. Ronaldo scored 40% of Juventus' 76 Serie A goals during the 2019/20 season as the Old Lady won their ninth consecutive Scudetto. However, this was not enough to preserve manager Maurizio Sarri's job, with the Italian relieved of his duties following Juventus' shock Champions League exit to Lyon. Ronaldo grabbed a brace in the second leg but could not prevent Juve from slipping to an away goals defeat, and the club are keen to strengthen their attacking options and sign someone capable of linking up well with the five-time Ballon d'Or winner. Juventus may need to sell first in order to raise funds for the Mexican international due to Wolves holding out for  Â£80m for the forward.
