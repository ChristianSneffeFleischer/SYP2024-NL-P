Leeds United have agreed an  £18m deal with Bayern Munich for talented French midfielder Micha  l Cuisance.  The 21-year-old joined the German giants from Borussia Monchengladbach for  £9m last summer, but has found it difficult to break into a midfield that is laden with world class talent. As a result, he is keen to move on from Bavaria and seek the regular first team opportunities that Hansi Flick is unable to afford him. Cuisance appeared just nine times for the treble winners last term and enjoyed a mere 17 minutes of action in Bayern's opening two Bundesliga games this time around.  The Frenchman is now poised to team up with Marcelo Bielsa at Elland Road, after The Athletic's David Ornstein confirmed a deal is agreed with Die Roten. The fee has been quoted at  £18m in some places, while others have noted that the fee may even reach  £20m. The German giants, though, still view Cuisance as a major talent and it's understood a large buy-back clause has been included in the deal. He is set to arrive in England on Wednesday and will complete a medical ahead of his move to west Yorkshire.  Leeds have been keen to add another central midfielder to their ranks this summer amid concerns over Adam Forshaw's fitness. The former Middlesbrough man hasn't featured in a competitive game in over a year, and is lacking in experience at the highest level.
