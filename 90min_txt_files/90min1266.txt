A picture of Ryan Gravenberch wearing a Liverpool shirt has emerged days after being linked with a move to Anfield. Gravenberch opted to sign for Bayern Munich from Ajax last summer but has struggled for game time at the Allianz Arena, sitting firmly being Joshua Kimmich and Leon Goretzka in the pecking order, while Konrad Laimer will join from RB Leipzig this summer. 90min reported earlier this week that Liverpool, as well as Arsenal and Manchester United, have been asked to be kept informed of developments on Gravenberch's future should be become available for transfer. With the Reds in the market for an alternative to Jude Bellingham after ending their pursuit of the Borussia Dortmund star, Gravenberch looks like he could be part of a viable solution to their problems. Social media sleuths have already worked their magic in finding any past connection of the Dutchman to Liverpool, digging up a picture of him donning a shirt from the 2019/20 season.

The picture originated from the Instagram page of Leandro Fernandes, who played with Gravenberch also played with at youth level with the Netherlands. Does this mean that Gravenberch is a Liverpool fan? Is he on his way to Merseyside as we speak? Is he singing 'Si Senor' and 'Oh Andy Andy' at the top of his lungs? No. Makes for a nice subplot at least, though. LISTEN NOW
