Arsenal have reached an agreement with West Ham for the British record transfer of Declan Rice, which will be worth  £105m overall, sources have confirmed to 90min. The Gunners had already seen two bids for Rice turned down, before submitting a third offer that totalled  £105m. That blew a  £90m package from Manchester City out of the water and saw the reigning Premier League and European champions pull out of the race. Although it hit their valuation of Rice, West Ham were not initially prepared to accept Arsenal   s bid as a result of the proposed payment structure     the Gunners were offering a guaranteed  £100m spread over more than three years, but the Hammers wanted it in two. The total sum being offered was not the problem and it paved the way for negotiations to continue. manual However, 90min now understands that the structure of the transfer has been agreed. The exact payment dates must still be ironed out, but an agreement there is also very close. Arsenal, who finished second in the Premier League title race to Manchester City     having led the way for most of the season, has remained Rice   s preferred destination and personal terms have already been all but agreed for him to complete a move to the Emirates Stadium. Signing the England midfield will take Arsenal   s summer spend north of  £200m, with a transfer for Kai Havertz already seemingly leaked before an official announcement and a deal for Jurrien Timber close after Ajax lowered their price demands to move towards a compromise.
