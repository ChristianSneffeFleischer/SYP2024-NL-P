Chelsea are close to formalising the signing of Villarreal striker Nicolas Jackson, sources have confirmed to 90min. The Blues have pursued a deal to sign the Senegal international for much of June, though were hesitant to meet his    35m release clause up front. 90min understands that Chelsea have agreed to pay slightly more than Jackson's release clause but paid in several instalments. Jackson will now fly to England to undergo a medical and become the second official signing of the Mauricio Pochettino era, following confirmation of Christopher Nkunku's move to Stamford Bridge this week. Chelsea have been scouring the market for a new striker and had initially identified Napoli's Victor Osimhen as their top target, but it would take a nine-figure sum to pry him away from the newly-crowned champions of Italy this summer. feed Tottenham had also anticipated an approach from the Blues for Harry Kane once former Spurs boss Pochettino was sworn in at Chelsea, but it's increasingly likely that the England captain stays put this summer. Jackson, who nearly moved to Bournemouth in January before failing a medical, ended the season in stunning form for Villarreal, rounding off the campaign with nine goals in eight games and leading their ultimately unsuccessful late push for a Champions League spot. Elsewhere at Chelsea, Kai Havertz's time at the club is coming to an end after agreeing a move to Arsenal, while the Blues have rejected a third bid from Manchester United for Mason Mount.
