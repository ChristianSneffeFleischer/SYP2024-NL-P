Barcelona are actively trying to force Frenkie de Jong out of the club, with La Blaugrana informing that player that must accept Manchester United's contract offer.  90min reported that Barca accepted a bid from Manchester United on Thursday - a guaranteed fee of    75m, with a deal inclusive of add-ons understood to be worth    85m in total.  With a fee agreed, all that is left to complete the transfer is De Jong accepting the Red Devils' contract offer, and according to Sport, that is something Barca are strongly encouraging the midfielder to do.  Barca are said to have given De Jong two options regarding Man Utd's offer: either say 'yes or yes'. The club are willing to leave the midfielder out of their pre-season tour of north America if he refuses to leave.  The club have also seemingly given Ferran Torres the number 21 jersey previously worn by De Jong, as the former Man City man updated his Instagram profile, adding the number 21 to his bio - although such a change has not been announced by the club as of yet.  Listen now to 90min's Talking Transfers podcast, with  Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey,  Harry Symeou  &  Toby Cudworth.
