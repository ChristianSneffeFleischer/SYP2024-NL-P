Lionel Messi has thanked Paris Saint-Germain fans for their support as he prepares to leave the club this summer. Manager Christophe Galtier recently confirmed that Messi will leave the club after two seasons in Paris, with the Argentine set for an uncertain summer as he waits to learn his next move. Messi is keen to return to former club Barcelona, where manager Xavi has publicly confirmed his desire to welcome the veteran forward with open arms, but questions over the La Liga side's finances have delayed an agreement. Where Messi will end up remains unclear, but what's certain is that his PSG career will come to an end on Saturday with the Ligue 1 finale against Clermont Foot. "I am very happy to have been able to represent PSG," Messi told ESPN before his farewell. "I really enjoyed playing in this team and with such good players. I want to thank the club for this wonderful experience." manual Barcelona are awaiting the approval of their summer budget from La Liga before pressing ahead with any transfer business, with Messi's return earmarked as the number one priority. As for PSG, Messi is not the only superstar leaving the club this summer as Sergio Ramos' departure from the Parc des Princes was confirmed on Friday. Ramos joined PSG on a free transfer just weeks before Messi's own move to France and the duo's departures will leave a significant whole in the first team which club officials are already working to fill. In defence, personal terms have been agreed with Bayern Munich's Lucas Hernandez, while the signing of winger Marco Asensio from Real Madrid has already been wrapped up.
