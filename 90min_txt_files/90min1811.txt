Arsenal have agreed a deal worth in excess of    20m for Polish international defender Jakub Kiwior, 90min can confirm. The 22-year-old has been at current club Spezia since the summer of 2021, having moved to Italy from Zilina. Kiwior featured for Poland at the recent World Cup in Qatar and made four appearances as they qualified for the knockout stages of the competition for the first time since 1986. Sources have confirmed to 90min that his career in Serie A is coming to an end, though, with Premier League leaders Arsenal close to finalising a deal that will be worth over    20m. A medical is scheduled to be completed this weekend. Listen now as  Scott Saunders  hosts  Graeme Bailey  and  Toby Cudworth  in the latest episode of Talking Transfers.
