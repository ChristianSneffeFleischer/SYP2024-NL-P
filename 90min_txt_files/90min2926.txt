Barcelona club president Joan Laporta has admitted that while he will do everything in his power to keep Frenkie de Jong, he refused to rule out the possibility of him leaving for Manchester United. 90min understands that Man Utd and Barcelona have agreed an    85m fee for the midfielder, but the deal is being held up by De Jong's insistence on being paid around    20m in deferred wages. Nevertheless, the Red Devils are remaining patient in their pursuit. Laporta has spoken about the 25-year-old's future plenty in recent weeks and has often insisted that he wants the Dutchman to stay at Camp Nou, but when asked by CBS Sports whether he could categorically confirm that De Jong won't end the transfer window at Man Utd, he admitted it was still possible. "In football, you never know. I can't say categorically. It all depends on the different parties. But in principle, I can say there is a strong possibility he stays, and I can say as president I will do my best for him to stay at Barcelona," Laporta said. He added: "The first thing to say is we want Frenkie to stay at Barcelona. We love the player and him as a human being. I want him to stay at Barcelona. He's a high-quality player and a good guy. I also know that he wants to stay." Listen now to 90min's Talking Transfers podcast, with  Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey,  Harry Symeou  &  Toby Cudworth.
