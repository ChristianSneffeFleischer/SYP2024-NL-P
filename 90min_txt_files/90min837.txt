Tottenham Hotspur and Brazil forward Richarlison has admitted that he dreams of signing for Real Madrid in the future. Richarilson joined Tottenham during the 2022 summer transfer window for a fee that could reach  Â£60m, but largely failed to live up his price tag during his maiden campaign with the Lilywhites. In 27 Premier League appearances during the 2022/23 season, the Brazilian managed just one goal for the club, though he did add a further two in their UEFA Champions League campaign. Despite his lack of form shown throughout last season, Richarlison has been linked with a move to Real Madrid, in part due to his relationship with manager Carlo Ancelotti - the two worked together at Everton. During a press conference while on international duty, Richarlison was asked about these links, replying: "Real Madrid is the biggest club in the world and every player wants to wear their shirt. feed "But I have a club, a contract - I have to prove why Tottenham bought me for a high price. But any player dreams of playing for Real Madrid." While Richarlison has failed to show any sort of form at club level, he has been impressive for Brazil over the last year. Playing as the Selecao's first choice striker, the 26-year-old managed to scored 10 goals in 10 appearances in 2022, including three goals during the FIFA World Cup in Qatar. The striker will be looking to find that international goalscoring touch at club level under new Tottenham manager Ange Postecoglou. The Australian comes to the club following two hugely successful seasons at Celtic, where he became known for a all-action attacking style of play - something which could suit Richarlison.
