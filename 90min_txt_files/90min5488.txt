Bayern Munich are close to re-signing Brazilian winger Douglas Costa from Juventus on a one-year loan deal. Costa initially joined the Bavarians in 2015 after signing from Shakhtar Donetsk in a    30m deal when Pep Guardiola was in charge. He went on to score 14 goals in 77 games across two seasons for Bayern before heading out on loan to Juventus for the 2017/18 season, and the move was made permanent for an initial    46m. Since then, he's managed just 10 goals in 103 games for Juventus and has largely been a peripheral figure in three successive title wins. Sky Sports are now reporting that he will return to Bayern on a one-year loan without an option or obligation to make the deal permanent. He will follow the late signings of Marc Roca from Espanyol - who was unveiled as a Bayern player on Sunday - and Bouna Sarr from Marseille, while a deal for Chelsea's Callum Hudson-Odoi is dead in the water. A loan offer with a  Â£70m obligation to buy was reportedly knocked back by the Blues earlier this week, and so it appears Bayern switched their focus back to Costa.
