Brighton are looking to offer Tariq Lamptey a bumper new contract in order to fend off interest from Bavarian giants Bayern Munich. An England Under-21 international, Lamptey joined Brighton from Chelsea in January for a fee rising to  £6m and has been one of the standout full-backs in the division since. Reports during the transfer window suggested that his good form had attracted the attention of European and Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich, although a move never materialised. ?

Lamptey currently earns around  £14,000-per-week and has three years left to run on his current contract, but manager Graham Potter and the club hierarchy are keen to show him how important he is to the side with a financial package to match his status in the squad. After making his Premier League debut as a substitute for Chelsea against Arsenal in December 2019, the academy product opted to leave the London club in an attempt to earn regular playing time elsewhere. A move to Bayern Munich would surely appeal to him with their track record of developing young players, including another Chelsea academy graduate in Jamal Musiala.
