Tottenham have announced that out-of-favour keeper Paulo Gazzaniga has joined Elche on loan until the end of the season. The 29-year-old completed a last minute deadline day switch and will join the La Liga relegation strugglers until the conclusion of the 2020/21 campaign. Gazzaniga was a favourite of former boss Mauricio Pochettino but has found himself out of the picture since Jose Mourinho's arrival as head coach. Captain Hugo Lloris has retained the starting gloves, while Joe Hart has been Mourinho's go-to number two after joining the club on a free transfer last summer.

Good luck, @GazzanigaPaulo! ? #THFC        #COYS pic.twitter.com/oiSwdYZhAX The Argentine keeper hasn't made a single appearance this season, and the club have now confirmed he will head to Spain in order to play regular football between now and May. In total, Gazzaniga has made 37 appearances for Tottenham after following Pochettino to the club from Southampton in 2017. He made his debut for the club against Crystal Palace in November 2017, helping Spurs pick up a narrow 1-0 win with a performance that had his manager saying he performed "fantastically well" considering it was his debut. Sporadic appearances followed over the next couple of seasons, predominantly in the League Cup, before Gazzaniga was handed an extended run in the first team last season after Lloris dislocated his elbow at Brighton.
