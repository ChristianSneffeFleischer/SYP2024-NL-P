Brentford are in talks with Sampdoria over the signing of Mikkel Damsgaard, 90min understands. The versatile 22-year-old, who is capable of playing as a midfielder, winger or forward, emerged as one of Europe's brightest talents during Denmark's run to the semi-finals of Euro 2022 last summer, notably putting his side ahead against England at Wembley. He was then understandably linked with moves all over the continent, though chose to stay in Italy with Sampdoria for the 2021/22 season. However, much of his season was disrupted by a thigh injury and he ended the campaign without registering a single goal or assist in 11 Serie A games. Nevertheless, interest in Damsgaard remains high, and 90min understands Brentford have already made two bids for him in the last couple of weeks. Sampdoria are holding out for around    20m, while the Bees' most recent offer was    11m up front plus    7m in add-ons and are not too far off his valuation. Listen now to 90min's Talking Transfers podcast, with  Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey,  Harry Symeou  &  Toby Cudworth. On the latest show they discuss Cristiano Ronaldo holding talks with Man Utd over his future, Barcelona signing Jules Kounde ahead of Chelsea, Man City rewarding Phil Foden with a new contract and more.
