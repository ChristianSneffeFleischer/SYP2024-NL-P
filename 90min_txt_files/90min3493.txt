Barcelona manager Xavi has praised the impact of the club's January signings, admitting that his side would be far worse off without them.  Despite their well-documented financial woes, Bar  a went out and made three signings during the January transfer window - bringing Premier League trio Adama Traore, Ferran Torres and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to Camp Nou. The three forwards have contributed 14 goals and assists since joining as the club have enjoyed a six-game unbeaten run.  Speaking to the press ahead of the Blaugrana's La Liga meeting with Athletic Club on Sunday, Xavi hailed the trio and admitted that he doesn't know what would've happened had they not signed for the club. "I don't know what would have happened if they didn't come," he said. "It would have been more difficult, that's clear." Xavi saved special praise of Aubameyang and Ferran Torres, calling the latter a 'spectacular player'.
