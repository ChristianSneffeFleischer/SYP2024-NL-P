Chelsea midfielder Enzo Fernandez has confessed he has spoken with fellow Argentine Paulo Dybala over a possible summer switch to Stamford Bridge. Dybala's bargain release clause -    12m to sides outside of Serie A - has piqued the interest of a number of clubs, with Chelsea reported to have added the Roma forward to their lengthy shortlist of potential targets. Blues defender Thiago Silva recently fuelled the fire by publicly urging Dybala to make the move to Chelsea, and now teammate Fernandez has followed suit. "I saw something about that. We   ll see. I hope he comes [to Chelsea]," Fernandez told Ole of the links between Chelsea and Dybala. "I talked to him and told him that I   m waiting for him to share a barbecue or something." feed Dybala has even been asked about the rumours but recently did his best to quash all speculation. "I   m motivated for pre-season. I   m happy at Roma," Dybala told LaRoma24. "I'm staying here." Chelsea have already signed both Christopher Nkunku and Nicolas Jackson this summer, the latter of whom made his first appearance in training on Tuesday, and the Blues are still exploring their attacking options in the transfer window. Montpellier striker Elye Wahi has been discussed, perhaps in relation to sister side Strasbourg, while Lyon starlet Rayan Cherki is known to have plenty of admirers at Stamford Bridge. The current focus remains on discussing a deal for Brighton midfielder Moises Caicedo, while Romelu Lukaku's desire to leave for Inter has led to drawn-out negotiations.
