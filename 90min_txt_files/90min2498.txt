Ferran Torres has laughed off rumours about him potentially leaving Barcelona.  The forward only joined the La Liga side in January of this year and was an important player for Xavi's side in the second half of last season. However, he has since lost his place in the starting XI with the club signing Robert Lewandowski and Raphinha in the summer transfer window.  With Ousmane Dembele impressing and Ansu Fati fit again too, it looks like playing opportunities will be few and far between for the Spaniard going forward.  Towards the end of the transfer window, it was rumoured that Arsenal were looking to take advantage of that and bring him to the Emirates. While a move never went through, it has been reported that they'll try to sign him in January.  Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  and  Toby Cudworth  bring you a brand new episode of Talking Transfers. The team discuss the fallout from the summer transfer window, Gavi's contract situation at Barcelona, Chelsea's midfield issues, Antony's suitability at Man Utd and more.  Available on  all audio platforms  and the  90min YouTube channel. If you can't see the podcast embed, click  here  to download the episode in full! He has laughed off such talk though, saying that he has no plans to leave so soon after joining and is enjoying the increased competition for places.    An exit? I have just arrived at Bar  a!    he said at a promotional event.
