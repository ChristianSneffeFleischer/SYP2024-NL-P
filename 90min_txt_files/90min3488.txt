Ronald Araujo has warned Barcelona he is not prepared to accept a lower salary than that of Andreas Christensen, who is close to sealing a move to Camp Nou. Christensen had been close to two contract extensions at Chelsea but has had his head turned by a free transfer to Barcelona at the end of the season and 90min understands a deal is close to completion. Barcelona hope Christensen can come in and compete with Araujo for minutes next season, but they still need to convince the latter to sign his own extension, with his current deal set to expire in 2023. Araujo has already rejected one offer as he was not impressed with the salary on offer, and with Christensen close to his own bumper deal, Marca note that the Uruguay international has reiterated his demands to the Blaugrana. He wants to stay at Barcelona, but Araujo has made it clear he wants his new contract to reflect his emergence as not only one of the club's top players, but as one of the finest young centre-backs in Europe. So far, Barcelona have not come close to his demands, which Araujo is prepared to lower slightly to facilitate an extension, and the defender is somewhat perplexed by Barcelona's willingness to splash out on Christensen while simultaneously refusing to meet his wishes. Araujo has warned Barcelona he will not accept a single cent less than Christensen as he wants the club to prove they have faith in him and value him, and further talks are planned in the coming weeks.
