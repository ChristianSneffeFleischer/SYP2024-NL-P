Enzo Fernandez is hoping Benfica allow him to leave in January, sources have confirmed to 90min. The 21-year-old World Cup winner is among the most-wanted midfielders around but comes with a    120m release clause which Benfica have warned suitors must be paid in its entirety if Fernandez is to be sold in January. 90min revealed earlier this week that Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United have all held talks with Benfica over a possible deal and sources have now confirmed that the Blues are making a real push for his signature. However, Benfica are standing firm with their demand that Fernandez's release clause must be triggered, which would require the full payment up front - something Chelsea are currently hesitant to agree to. Chelsea are willing to pay more than the release clause in order persuade Benfica to sanction a deal - the same approach used by the Blues in their pursuit of RB Leipzig's Christopher Nkunku - and 90min has been told that there is confidence within Stamford Bridge that they can secure the signature of Fernandez, who has been on their radar since his time in Argentina. Fernandez himself is fully aware of the offer on the table from Chelsea, with personal terms already agreed in principle, and he is keen to make the move. 90min understands he would rather join in January than wait until the summer.  Despite their tough stance, sources have confirmed that Benfica have started looked at potential replacements and one could be Fernandez's countryman in the shape of Velez Sarsfield starlet Maximo Perrone.
