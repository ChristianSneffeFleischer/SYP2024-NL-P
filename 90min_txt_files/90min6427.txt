Chelsea boss Frank Lampard has refused to rule out the Blues further strengthening their attacking options this summer. The west Londoners have already drafted in Ajax's Hakim Ziyech and RB Leipzig star Timo Werner in deals worth up to a combined  £86m. However, Chelsea have been heavily linked with Bayer Leverkusen's Kai Havertz and are understood to be a potential destination for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang - if the Gabonese striker doesn't extend his contract at Arsenal this summer.  Aubameyang has just a year left on his current deal at the Emirates Stadium and is keen on playing Champions League football. To stay put, it's claimed he also wants a three-year contract - despite being 31 - worth  £250,000-a-week. Nevertheless, Lampard rued missed chances in the Blues' recent 3-2 defeat at West Ham and was reluctant to completely rule out adding further attacking reinforcements this summer in his most recent pre-match press conference. "I   m not completely sure what we   re going to look at in the front line. I   m not sure," Lampard told the media, in quotes carried by the Mirror.    I certainly don   t want to talk about those things because at the moment we are working towards trying to finish off this season and trying to be better in front of goal in the next five or six games or whatever we   ve got with the FA Cup included.    The Chelsea boss, however, appeared a little keener when talking about strengthening his defensive options after his backline were ruthlessly exposed against the Hammers.    Defensively the players that are here now I have to focus on," Lampard said.    What happens in the summer will be what happens. I don   t want to talk too far ahead. It's not the right thing to do. We   ve got a strong group and we   ve got a job to do.
