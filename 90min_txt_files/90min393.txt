Liverpool are keeping a close eye on Chelsea's push for Moises Caicedo as they consider making their own move for the Ecuador international, 90min understands. The Reds entered this summer with a view to rebuilding in midfield and have already spent  £95m on Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai from Brighton and RB Leipzig respectively. There had already been plans to sign a third midfielder, with Southampton's Romeo Lavia admired at Anfield, but Liverpool could soon find themselves needing further reinforcements as both Fabinho and Jordan Henderson are considering moves to Saudi Arabia. Steven Gerrard's Al Ettifaq are pushing to sign Henderson, while Fabinho has significant interest from Saudi champions Al Ittihad, who are managed by former Wolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo. Thiago Alcantara is also a target in the Middle East. Should any of the trio leave, Liverpool may be forced to buying a new midfielder, and with the possibility of raising a significant sum of money unexpectedly, a move for Caicedo has been considered. feed Caicedo is top of Chelsea's transfer wish list and the Blues have long been in talks with Brighton over a deal to sign the 21-year-old, who the Seagulls value at  £100m. Chelsea have been looking to negotiate a discount and have not yet submitted a formal offer, instead seeking an informal agreement with Brighton to ensure their first official bid is accepted. However, Liverpool are now considering a late move for Caicedo, with their next move set to depend on Fabinho and Henderson's decisions. The duo are yet to decide if they want to head to the Saudi Pro League, and while manager Jurgen Klopp has made it clear he does not want to lose either, he is prepared to listen to offers if Fabinho or Henderson indicate they would like to leave.
