Eduardo Camavinga wants to move to Paris-Saint Germain but Stade Rennais remain hopeful of keeping him beyond this summer. The midfielder is one of the hottest properties on the planet, making over 80 senior appearances despite only being 18. He has been capped four times by France, but just missed out on Les Bleus' Euro 2020 squad. He currently has just one year left to run on his Rennes contract and is attracting interest from Europe's top clubs. With the race for Camavinga hotting up, club president Nicolas Holveck admitted that the midfielder would likely be sold if he does not sign an extension. "If he does not extend, he will have to consider a departure," he said (via RMC Sport). "But there is no deadline, that does not exist in football. Then, the best thing for everyone would be if they stay. I am a perpetual optimist. We have to find the best solution for him and for Stade Rennais. Playing in Europe, now that it is in place, that can change a lot of things. If Eduardo can do one more season at Stade Rennais, we are not going to deprive ourselves of it." Real Madrid transfer target Eduardo Camavinga has decided to leave Rennes this season, and join PSG. [@RMCsport] ?? Holveck may be staying optimistic but the chances of Camavinga penning fresh terms are increasingly remote. The midfielder is thought to favour a move to recently deposed Ligue 1 champions PSG.
