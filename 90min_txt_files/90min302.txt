Bayern Munich forward Sadio Mane has agreed a deal in principle to join Saudi Pro League side Al Nassr, sources have confirmed to 90min. The former Liverpool star has been one of the more high-profile players linked with a move to the Middle East this transfer window. Mane is coming off the back of a rather underwhelming debut season with Bayern, scoring 12 goals in 38 games across all competitions and rose to infamy when he got into a physical altercation with teammate Leroy Sane following a Champions League loss. 90min reported in May that Bayern would field offers for Mane, though he initially refused to discuss a move to Saudi Arabia. Steven Gerrard sought to ramp up Saudi Pro League interest in Mane after taking over at Al Ettifaq, but 90min understands he has now quickly reached an agreement in principle on personal terms with Cristiano Ronaldo's Al Nassr. feed The move comes as a major U-turn, with Mane stressing that he would not consider a move to Saudi Arabia even as recently as a fortnight ago. Bayern believe they will not be able to recoup the  Â£35m they paid to sign Mane from Liverpool but will look to bring in a sum as close to that as possible. The Bundesliga champions believe that this deal could advance quickly and Mane could complete a move to Al Nassr in the near future. Meanwhile, Bayern remain interested in signing Harry Kane from Tottenham Hotspur, though sources have told 90min that Spurs are still refusing to even put a price tag on their star striker.
