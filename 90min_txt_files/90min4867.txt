Julian Draxler is set to see out what remains of his contract with Paris Saint-Germain before moving on and finding a new club in the summer. The German has fallen out of favour in the French capital and has made just 11 league appearances so far this season, but the club are now under new management with Mauricio Pochettino, having sacked Thomas Tuchel in December 2020. The 27-year-old's current deal expires in June and he is free to agree a deal with a new club on a pre-contract basis, with speculation also linking him to a January exit. This will not be the case though, according to BILD and as reported by Get French Football News, who claim that Draxler will stay with Les Parisiens until the end of the season. A decision over his future is expected to be made in March, effectively ruling out a mid-season transfer due to the fact that Draxler holds a favourable contract and isn't in a rush to leave Paris. 90min understands that Arsenal have shown an interest in Draxler and considered him in their search for an attacking midfielder this month. And while a loan deal for Martin Odegaard is edging closer to completion, there is interest in offering Draxler a pre-contract deal to land him on a free transfer. The German joined PSG from Wolfsburg in 2017 in a deal worth    42m and has racked up plenty of French domestic silverware during his stay, but has failed to truly provide the impact expected in their pursuit of a Champions League crown.
