Paris Saint-Germain have confirmed the signing of 22-year-old midfielder Lee Kang-in from Mallorca. PSG have been incredibly active this summer and have already announced the arrivals of Milan Skriniar, Marco Asensio and Manuel Ugarte, while Luis Enrique has replaced Christophe Galtier in the dugout. The next new face in Paris is Lee, who has inked a five-year contract in the French capital. "It's a pleasure to be able to join Paris Saint-Germain, it's one of the biggest clubs in the world, with some of the greatest players in the world," said Lee, who will wear the number 19. "I can't wait to start this new adventure." PSG are understood to have parted with a fee of    22m to get this deal over the line. feed The French giants are not yet finished this summer and are expected to announce the arrival of defender Lucas Hernandez from Bayern Munich in the coming days.  After Lucas' arrival is confirmed, PSG's focus may well turn to departures and there is no issue more pressing than the future of Kylian Mbappe, who could be sold this summer after admitting he does not plan to extend his contract beyond next summer. Mbappe has publicly vowed to remain with PSG next season but club officials have made it clear that he will not be permitted to leave on a free transfer, leaving him two options - a contract extension or a sale. Long-time suitors Real Madrid are waiting for clarity on Mbappe's stance, safe in the knowledge they could sign him for free in 2024.
