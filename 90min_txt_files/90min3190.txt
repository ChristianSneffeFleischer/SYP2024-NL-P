Barcelona are still keen to keep out-of-contract winger Ousmane Dembele, despite a report claiming some staff members at Camp Nou have little faith in his footballing knowledge. The Frenchman allowed his contract with Barcelona to expire this summer, despite having an offer from the Blaugrana on the table since January. It is believed that Dembele has been asked to take a 40% pay cut to extend his stay at the club. Meanwhile, Chelsea are keen on signing the 25-year-old and have been for some time - and they could step up their interest as Barcelona look to sneak in ahead of the Blues to sign Leeds winger Raphinha. Barcelona officials had wanted Dembele to decide on his future before the squad returned for pre-season on Monday and, although that 'deadline' has passed, numerous reports from Spain state that the offer of an extension remains. However, one of those reports, from Catalan outlet ARA, claims to have spoken to a member of Xavi's backroom staff about the situation, and the results were mixed. "Dembele does not understand some aspects of the game, but we want him to stay," the staff member is quoted as saying.
