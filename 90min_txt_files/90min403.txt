The Reds are in the midst of a rebuild with a heavy emphasis on retooling in the midfield department, already signing Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai this transfer window. 90min reported on Thursday that Jordan Henderson is considering an offer to join Al Ettifaq, who are managed by Liverpool legend Steven Gerrard. Thiago Alcantara has rejected the chance to move to the Saudi Pro League this summer, and now a third Liverpool midfielder is the subject of interest from the Middle Eastern state. 90min understands that while Liverpool had not planned to lose many midfielders this summer, they are contemplating whether to sell Fabinho to Al Ittihad after receiving an offer. The Saudi champions have added Karim Benzema, N'Golo Kante and Jota to their ranks already this window and Fabinho is believed to be keen to join them. feed Jurgen Klopp's side could step up their interest in midfield targets on their shortlist if they sanction further sales, with Southampton's Romeo Lavia and Bayern Munich's Ryan Gravenberch on their radar.
