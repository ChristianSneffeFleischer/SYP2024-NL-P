Newcastle United are preparing an opening offer for Everton ace Anthony Gordon, sources have confirmed to 90min, but Chelsea are also monitoring the situation. 90min revealed last week that Everton were ready to consider approaches for the 21-year-old forward, after failing to come to an agreement over an extension to his contract, which is set to run until 2025. Sources have told 90min that Newcastle have been doing their homework on Gordon and have been pleased with the reports that have come back on him. Magpies boss Eddie Howe has admitted he would like some Premier League experience coming into his squad this month, and Gordon does offer that with over 60 top-flight games under his belt. Everton need to bolster their finances this month in order to bring in other players, such as Villarreal's Arnaut Danjuma, and Gordon is one of those they can use to raise funds.  On this edition of Talking Transfers, Scott Saunders hosts Toby Cudworth & Graeme Bailey to discuss all the big transfer stories. This week's agenda includes Jude Bellingham, Harry Kane, Declan Rice, Hakim Ziyech, Leandro Trossard, Pedro Porro, Mykhailo Mudryk and more!
