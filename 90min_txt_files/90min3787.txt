FC Barcelona have issued Ousmane Dembele with an ultimatum, telling the Frenchman that he has one month to sign a new contract with the Catalan giants or he'll be sold, as his current deal ticks towards its expiry at the end of the season.  The Blaugrana want the winger to extend his stay at Camp Nou beyond the summer of 2022, and they are locked in negotiations with his representatives. However, the former Borussia Dortmund star has held off putting pen to paper, alerting Europe's giants of his situation.  And according to Mundo Deportivo, Bar  a are growing impatient in their attempts to tie down Dembele, and they have given the winger an ultimatum: sign a new contract in the next month, or he'll find himself on the transfer market in January.  The Blaugrana are confident they can convince Dembele that his future lies in Catalonia, although they are concerned that his agent is 'brainwashing' him and persuading him to pursue offers elsewhere.  Barcelona are aware that they cannot compete financially with the rest of Europe, meaning Dembele's head might be turned by higher and more lucrative offers. However, they believe he wants to stay and prove himself at the club - despite his representative hoping to cash in on a move away.  The idea of carrying the Blaugrana back to their old dizzying heights is appealing to the player, even if it means receiving a lower salary than one he could achieve in the Premier League or in France.
