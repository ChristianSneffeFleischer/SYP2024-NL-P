Leeds has confirmed the arrival of Kristoffer Klaesson with the goalkeeper penning a four-year deal at Elland Road. Marcelo Bielsa has been actively seeking back-up for first-choice stopper Illan Meslier after his understudy Kiko Casilla joined La Liga outfit Elche on a season-long loan.        #LUFC is pleased to announce the signing of goalkeeper Kristoffer Klaesson from V Â¥lerenga Having emerged as a transfer target for the Whites, Klaesson has now completed his move to the Premier League with Leeds taking to their official website to confirm his arrival. "Leeds United are pleased to announce the signing of goalkeeper Kristoffer Klaesson," they wrote. "The 20-year-old joins the Whites from Norwegian side Valerenga for an undisclosed fee. "Following a successful medical, the goalkeeper has penned a four-year-deal at Elland Road, running until the summer of 2025." News that a deal for Klaesson has been rubber-stamped will come as a relief to Bielsa after he suffered late disappointed in his pursuit of Conor Gallagher. The Chelsea midfielder was understood to have undergone a medical with Leeds ahead of a proposed loan move earlier this week, but a late swoop from Crystal Palace saw the Whites miss out on the youngster. Nevertheless, Bielsa has still enjoyed a successful transfer window with Klaesson the sixth new face through the door at Elland Road.  The signings of Lewis Bate, Junior Firpo, Jack Harrison, Sean McGurk and Amari Miller had all been confirmed prior to the announcement that Klaesson had joined the club.
