Fabio Silva   s club record transfer to Wolves is being investigated by the Portuguese authorities. Wanderers paid Porto    40m for Silva last summer when he was just 18 and endured a tricky first season. Tasked with filling in for the talismanic Raul Jimenez - who spent the majority of the campaign sidelined with a head injury - he managed just four goals in 32 Premier League appearances. As part of a big operation investigating issues with agents, the transfer of Fabio Silva from Porto to #Wolves is being investigated by Portuguese authorities.    7m of the fee went to Gestifute and     3m to STV, a company which belongs to Fabio Silva   s father.

As reported by Correio da Manha (via the Mirror), the deal that brought Silva to England is currently under investigation. The authorities want to discern why Porto did not receive a larger proportion of the    40m transfer fee. They were due to profit around    30m after agent fees were deducted. That    10m broke down into    7m for GestiFute - owned by notorious super-agent Jorge Mendes - and    3m for STV, a company headed by Silva   s father. However, on a financial report, Porto claimed they only profited    25m from the deal. This has led to questions about where the remaining    5m has gone. The inquiry is part of a wider investigation into the culture of transfers involving Porto and rivals Benfica, named Operation Red Card. Recently, Benfica president Luis Filipe Vieira was placed under house arrest due to suspected tax fraud and money laundering.
