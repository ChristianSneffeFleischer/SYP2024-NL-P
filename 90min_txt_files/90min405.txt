Arsenal have opened talks with Brazilian side Gremio over a deal for midfielder Bitello, sources have confirmed to 90min. Club representatives flew to Brazil earlier this week and were in attendance at Gremio's clash with Bahia on Wednesday - Bitello played the full 90 minutes. Bitello has emerged as an Arsenal target through sporting director Edu, who has used his contacts in his homeland to target him and line up a prospective deal. Sources have told 90min that it is a similar situation to that which saw them sign Gabriel Martinelli from Ituano in 2019 - a player who is under the radar in Brazil, but one who their scouts believe could make an impact in the Premier League. feed It is believed Gremio are prepared to accept a deal worth  Â£8.5m including potential profit from any future sale. Talks are ongoing but sources believe a deal could be struck this week. The 23-year-old is an attacking midfielder, but can play all over the frontline or in midfield. 90min has been told that he is not dissimilar in his style of play to former Arsenal winger Willian. Arsenal are working on a move for Bitello having already made major strides in this summer's transfer market. They have confirmed the arrival of Kai Havertz, while deals for Declan Rice and Jurrien Timber will be announced shortly.
