"Aleksandar Kolarov is officially a new Inter player: the Serbian footballer moves to the Nerazzurri permanently from AS Roma," a statement read.  It's understood the Nerazzurri paid Roma    1.5m to secure the services of the 34-year-old on a one-year deal, where he'll reportedly earn a    3m salary. However, an option of extending his deal by a further year has been placed in Kolarov's contract and if he plays a certain amount of games in his debut season, that clause will be triggered.  The Serbia skipper joins Inter following a productive campaign in the Italian capital under Paulo Fonseca's tutelage. He was a fixture in a Giallorossi side which finished fifth in Serie A last season. ? | ANNUNCIOAleksandar #Kolarov    un nuovo giocatore dell'Inter!       ?? https://t.co/fss4C9gU2n#WelcomeKolarov #NotForEveryone pic.twitter.com/3HjmxqAATJ Kolarov made 34 domestic appearances for Roma last time out - mostly at left-back as part of a back four - and scored seven times, adding a further four assists.
