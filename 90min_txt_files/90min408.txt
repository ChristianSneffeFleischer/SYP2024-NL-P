The agent of new Barcelona signing Vitor Roque has claimed that both Manchester United and Tottenham tried to hijack the striker's move to Camp Nou with bids worth close to    100m. Roque has signed up with Barcelona and will join the reigning Spanish champions next summer after they agreed to a deal which could be worth over    60m if all add-ons and bonuses are triggered. After the 18-year-old was unveiled as the latest Blaugrana signing, his agent made an appearance on the Charla Podcast in which he made the huge claim that both United and Tottenham had lodged enormous bids for Roque. "I can confirm that English clubs tried to hijack the Vitor Roque deal," agent Andre Cury said. "Tottenham and Manchester United sent important bids, way better than Bar  a. They were worth more than    100m in total. "However, his career plan is well defined and we opted for Barcelona. Now is not the time to look at the money." feed Despite Cury's claims, 90min understands that Arsenal were the only side to ever make a significant push for Roque, but the Gunners turned to other targets months ago when it became clear that the Brazilian was only focused on Barcelona. Chelsea were also known to be interested in Roque as part of their ramped-up scouting of South America, but no formal offer was ever made. Roque will remain in Brazil with Athletico Paranaense for the next 12 months before moving to Catalonia to link up with Xavi's side. The Blaugrana boss has already added Ilkay Gundogan and Inigo Martinez on free transfers this summer and is still looking for a new right-back and two new midfielders, with replacing Sergio Busquets now his top priority.
