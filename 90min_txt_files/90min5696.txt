Barcelona technical director Ramon Planes has spoken publicly about the club   s interest in signing Manchester City defender Eric Garcia to feed into a long-term vision of building a new squad. While Garcia has been tipped to join Bar  a come what may by the summer of 2021 at the latest - when his City contract expires - Planes has expressed doubt over whether a deal will be possible this year. In the circumstances, City are prepared to sell Garcia this summer if their asking price in the range of    15m ( £14m) to    20m ( £18.5m) is met. However, Barcelona are thought to have only offered    10m ( £9.2m). Garcia was born in Barcelona and sent nine years in the club   s famed La Masia youth setup before City took him to Manchester in 2017 at the age of 16. Should he return to Catalonia, it would be a story similar to those of Gerard Pique, Cesc Fabregas and Jordi Alba.    It's true that we are looking for someone to help us in defence. Eric Garcia is a great player, made in Barcelona, who loves the club, but whether or not he can join depends on the market,    Planes explained to the media this week.    The club's idea is to build a young side alongside players who have given a lot to the club. Eric has that profile,    the Camp Nou official added. Planes was in front of the media to mark the formal unveiling of Miralem Pjanic as a Barcelona player, nearly three months after his transfer from Juventus worth up to    65m was confirmed.  ?       #PjanicCuler is new number 8     £ A post shared by  FC Barcelona (@fcbarcelona) on Sep 15, 2020 at 4:48am PDT The deal was conducted in coordination with Barcelona   s    72m     rising up to    82m     sale of Arthur Melo to Juventus in the opposite direction.
