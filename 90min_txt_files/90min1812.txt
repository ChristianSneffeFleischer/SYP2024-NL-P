West Ham United have completed the signing of Aston Villa striker Danny Ings in a deal worth  £15m. The 30-year-old has signed a two-and-half-year contract at London Stadium, and arrives to provide additional firepower to a West Ham side that have scored just 15 Premier League goals all season. Ings has netted six times for Villa in 18 appearances during 2022/23, but has been unable to command a regular place under Unai Emery, or predecessor Steven Gerrard. 90min revealed on Thursday that West Ham had agreed to sign Ings for  £15m - comprised of a  £12m guaranteed fee and  £3m in add-ons - and he has now become David Moyes' second signing of the January transfer window.    I   m really excited to join West Ham United,    Ings told the club's official website..    It   s important I settle in as quickly as I can do     and do the important stuff on the pitch for West Ham.    We   ve got some massive games ahead of us     and I   ve come here to try and score as many goals as I can to help the team to get some positive results.    I   m really looking forward to getting started.    Listen now as  Scott Saunders  hosts  Graeme Bailey  and  Toby Cudworth  in the latest episode of Talking Transfers.
