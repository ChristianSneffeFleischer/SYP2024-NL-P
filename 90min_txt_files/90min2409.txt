Barcelona are exploring ways to bring Lionel Messi back to Catalonia next year, sources have confirmed to 90min. Messi left Barcelona in emotional fashion in 2021 following 17 seasons and nearly 800 games after the club's financial woes prevented them from handing him a new contract. He then joined Paris Saint-Germain on a free transfer. His first year in the French capital was one of the least prolific of his career, but this term he looks back to his best and that has led to many Bar  a fans hoping that he could yet return to the club. Messi's current deal expires at the end of the season - though with the option of a further year - meaning he could be free to return to Barcelona or any other interested club. Sources close to Messi have confirmed to 90min that no decision has been made about his future, whether that is to leave PSG, return to Bar  a or go elsewhere. Like so many players, Messi's focus is on the World Cup in Qatar as the 35-year-old will likely only have one last chance to capture the game's biggest prize.
