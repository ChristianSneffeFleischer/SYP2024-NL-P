Aston Villa have made a second offer for Bayer Leverkusen winger Moussa Diaby, 90min understands. Villa's first bid for the France international, which was worth  £30m, was rejected by the German outfit, who are understood to value Diaby closer to  £51m. Talks between the two teams have continued and Unai Emery's side have now made a new proposal of around  £43m, which would represent a club record deal for the Birmingham giants. 24-year-old Diaby has two years left on his current deal in Germany, but 90min has been told his representatives have made it clear to Leverkusen he is ready to leave the Bundesliga and a move to the Premier League has long been on his radar. feed Villa are determined to bolster their attacking options and Diaby is their main target at this point, although they are not the only interested party. Saudi Pro League side Al Nassr are willing to match Villa's offer for Diaby, but sources close to the player have told 90min a move to England would be his preferred option. Villa have already been busy bolstering their squad this summer with the signings of Youri Tielemans and Pau Torres as manager Emery seeks to turn the Villans into a team capable of qualifying for the Champions League.
