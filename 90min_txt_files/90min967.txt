Karim Benzema has agreed a three-year contract with Saudi Pro League club Al-Ittihad, 90min understands. Benzema called time on his Real Madrid career earlier this month, bringing an end to his 14-year association with Los Blancos and going out in suitable fashion with a goal in the 1-1 draw with Athletic Club to close out the 2022/23 La Liga season. Sources have confirmed to 90min that Benzema is now set to take his talents to Saudi Arabia, where Al-Ittihad have agreed the terms of a three-year deal with the veteran striker. Real Madrid will host a farewell event for Benzema on Tuesday, after which the 35-year-old's move to Al-Ittihad is expected to be announced. Benzema will head to the Middle East to do battle with former Real teammate Cristiano Ronaldo, whose Al-Nassr side finished five points behind champions Al-Ittihad in the Saudi Pro League title race last season. feed Al-Ittihad are currently managed by former Wolves and Tottenham manager Nuno Espirito Santo, who signed a two-year contract when he joined in the summer of 2022. Leading the line for Al-Ittihad last season was Morocco international Abderrazak Hamdallah, who finished as the division's top scorer with 21 goals in 26 games, but Benzema appears set to take his place in the team. Benzema's move to Saudi Arabia comes amid a huge push from Saudi officials to drive more big names to the Middle East.  90min reported recently that Chelsea's N'Golo Kante has been approached over a move to Saudi Arabia when his contract expires next month, while plenty of other high-profile players are being targeted for lucrative moves. Lionel Messi, who has departed Paris Saint-Germain, has an enormous offer on the table from Al-Hilal to become the highest-paid player on the planet.
