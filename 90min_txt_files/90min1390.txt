France midfield prospect Khephren Thuram has admitted he is aware of the growing interest in him at home and abroad as he prepares to make his international debut for Les Bleus. Liverpool, Manchester United and Newcastle United are among the Premier League clubs who have taken a keen interest in the Nice player. But they are not alone in following the 21-year-old, with Paris Saint Germain, Inter and Juventus all tracking him too. Speaking ahead of this week's Euro 2024 qualifiers against Netherlands and Republic of Ireland, Thuram was asked about the clubs on his tail.    I hear, but I don   t concentrate on it,    Thuram said.    I am with Nice. I am very happy where I am.  "I am trying to get bigger with the club. I am trying to grow up with the club. So, yeah, obviously I hear it [the interest] but it   s not the most important. The most important is to do good with the team and be happy where I am.
