Atletico Madrid forward Joao Felix has confirmed his desire to join Barcelona as he seeks to seal a move away from the Wanda Metropolitano. Felix joined Chelsea on loan for the second half of last season on an expensive deal which did not include an option to buy and, after he bagged four goals in 20 appearances, the Blues declined to pursue a permanent move. Now back at Atletico, 90min understands that Felix has reiterated his desire to leave the club this summer and he has now named Barcelona as his dream destination. "I   d love to play for Bar  a," he told Fabrizio Romano. "Barcelona has always been my first choice and I   d love to join Bar  a. "It was always my dream since I was a kid. If it happens, it will be a dream come true for me." feed Reports in Spain state that Barcelona actually struck a deal to sign Felix in January 2022, agreeing to pay an initial    70m with a further    65m in add-ons, only for Financial Fair Play regulations to get in the way. Felix spent a further 12 months at Atletico before joining Chelsea and is now on the hunt for a new club. Paris Saint-Germain are understood to be working on a deal to sign Felix, who has been valued at    90m by Atletico - a fee which would almost certainly be too high for Barcelona without significant player sales. PSG are looking at a loan deal with an option to buy Felix permanently, but Atletico are pushing for an obligation instead.
