Flamengo are currently not allowing Matheus Franca or Joao Gomes to move to the Premier League, 90min understands. Newcastle United have been trying to finalise a deal for Franca, while Wolves had agreed a deal for Gomes before Lyon tried to gazump them. On 18-year-old Franca, Newcastle have so far offered as much as    16m, but Flamengo had insisted they wanted more than    20m for the attacking midfielder. Intermediaries are continuing talks, but Flamengo are insistent they are now not looking to sell. The club's vice-president Marco Baz stated earlier this week: "We do not put Matheus Franca up for sale. He is not for sale. We are not interested in negotiating Matheus Franca at this moment." Franca, who is contracted to Flamengo to 2027, is believed to be keen on moving to England with Newcastle.
