Angers have accepted they will have to sell midfielder Azzedine Ounahi during the January transfer window, according to club president Said Chabane. The 22-year-old midfielder has enjoyed a breakout World Cup with his native Morocco, earning acclaim for his performances in midfield as the Atlas Lions defied expectations to reach the semi-finals of the competition. Premier League clubs including West Ham and Leicester City have been linked with Ounahi in the past 12 months, but they could be set to be blown out of the water as the midfielder's performances have attracted interest from European giants such as Barcelona and Juventus. Speaking to RTL Sport, Chabane said:    We have had many offers for him, from big and medium-sized clubs.    They have come from all over, from Italy, Spain, England, and France.    Our wish is to find an agreement in January, but also that he can remain until the end of the season.    Chabane has also discussed the future of Sofiane Boufal, who plays alongside Ounahi for both Angers and Morocco.    I tell myself that in June they will leave, or that in January they will leave," said Chabane.    We are preparing for everything, we had a meeting this afternoon with the coach and the sports coordinator to try to consider all the possible scenarios and not end up in the water if it were to happen.
