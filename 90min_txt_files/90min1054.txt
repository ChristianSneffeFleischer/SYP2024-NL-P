Brighton and Hove Albion manager Roberto De Zerbi has confirmed that Alexis Mac Allister and Moises Caicedo have played their 'last game' for the club.  The pair both featured in Brighton's 2-1 defeat at the hands of Aston Villa on the final day of the season, with Mac Allister playing the full 90 minutes while Caicedo was a half-time substitute. Despite the defeat, Brighton have secured UEFA Europa League football for the 2023/24 season, finishing in sixth place at the end of what's been a stunning campaign for the club.  Unfortunately for the Seagulls fans however, they will have to play in the Europa League without their two star midfielders after De Zerbi confirmed both were set to leave the club:    Yes, I think it can be the last game for Alexis and Moises Caicedo. I am really sorry because they are two great people and two great players but the policy of Brighton is like this.    It is right that they can leave, they can play at a higher level. People believe Alexis is a fantastic player, but as a man he is better than the player. feed    I   m really sorry if we lose him, if we lose Moises Caicedo, but players like this deserve to play at another level, another level in terms of competition, in terms of importance of the club, prestige of the club." 90min understands that Liverpool are the current frontrunners in the race to sign Mac Allister, and the club are keen to sign the World Cup winner in the next few weeks. A deal to sign the midfielder may cost as much as  Â£70m.  Caicedo, on the other hand, is of interest to Arsenal, Manchester United, Liverpool and Manchester City. 90min recently reported that Brighton were willing to listen to offers for the player this summer.
