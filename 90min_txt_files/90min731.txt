Bournemouth are a step closer to securing their second signing of the summer after agreeing a fee with Roma for Justin Kluivert. 90min understands that the Cherries, who surprisingly dismissed Gary O'Neil in favour of hiring former Real Valladolid manager Andoni Iraola on Monday, have agreed a fee just shy of  £11m, including add-ons, for the 24-year-old. Fulham, Crystal Palace and Everton had also shown interest in signing Kluivert, who had the option to stay at Roma and fight for his place, but it's Bournemouth where he will look to rebuild his career after three consecutive seasons out on loan. Kluivert, capped twice by the Netherlands, spent the 2022/23 campaign at Valencia after failing to force his way into the first team picture at Jose Mourinho's Roma. RB Leipzig and OGC Nice had been year-long landings prior to his most recent loan - a fate that few would have predicted after he moved to Italy in the summer of 2018 for a fee of just over  £15m. feed Tipped as star of the future at the time, Kluivert has played just 53 times in Serie A for Roma - who have completed the signing of Eintracht Frankfurt defender Evan Ndicka ahead of Tottenham and Liverpool - after scoring ten goals for Ajax in his breakthrough Eredivisie season. Should his move to the south coast go through as expected, Kluivert will become Bournemouth's second signing of the summer. Hamed Traore's loan spell from Sassuolo has already been made permanent for  £20m, despite the Ivory Coast international going seven games without a goal last season. In terms of outgoings, Bournemouth have released Jack Stacey and Junior Stanislas, while Jefferson Lerma has joined Crystal Palace at the end of his contract. Jordan Zemura has also left Bournemouth on a free transfer, joining Udinese in Serie A.
