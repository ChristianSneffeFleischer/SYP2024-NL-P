West Ham are said to have reignited their interest Lyon defender Marcelo, who is available on a free transfer next summer. The Hammers were linked with Marcelo throughout the summer transfer window and were close to agreeing a deal to bring the Brazilian to west London. if reports are to be believed, but the deal collapsed. The Sun report, however, that West Ham are now in a position to land Marcelo on a free transfer having previously made a  Â£20m bid for the player, with his contract set to expire at the end of the season. The report states that Marcelo was 'desperate' to move to London and is still keen on playing in the Premier League, with the prospect of playing for the Irons described as a 'great opportunity'. The issue for West Ham, however, is that Marcelo will turn 34 before the end of the season, meaning signing him would be using up their budget on yet another senior player, despite his vast European experience with PSV, Hannover, Besiktas and Lyon. The Hammers have spent big to try and reduce the age of their squad in recent times. 25-year-old summer signing Said Benrahma is improving with each week, while 23-year-old Jared Bowen signed in January 2020 and has also been a hit, as has 25-year-old Tomas Soucek.
