Erik ten Hag has revealed that Cristiano Ronaldo will not be leaving Manchester United in the final days of the transfer window. Ronaldo requested to leave Old Trafford earlier this summer in search of Champions League football, and though he was heavily linked with the likes of Atletico Madrid, Bayern Munich and Chelsea, all possible big-name suitors backed away from a transfer. 90min understands that Napoli and former club Sporting CP have explored a deal in recent days, but Ten Hag has now confirmed that Ronaldo will be staying at the club. "It is clear, of course. We need quality players. You need more to cover all the games to keep the consistency going. That's what we strive for," he said. Ten Hag was also asked about the future of Aaron Wan-Bissaka, to which he added: "This squad will play from September until January, at minimum, this season."
