Manchester United are closing in on their first signing of the summer, with a deal agreed for youngster Alvaro Fernandez Carreras to join the club on a four-year deal. The left-back became a free agent on June 30 after he failed to agree an extension with Los Blancos, having previously been part of the Juvenil C side in Madrid this campaign. Since joining from Deportivo de La Coru  a three years ago, Carreras has impressed in Madrid's youth sides, steadily rising through the ranks, and it was hoped that Madrid could convince him to commit his future to the club, however, AS report that United have managed to lure the defender to Old Trafford. 17-year-old Carreras has agreed a deal with the Red Devils to join on a four-year contract and move straight into the club's youth side. It's added that he will be integrated into the senior setup whenever injury or form strikes the first team, although the teenager's ambitions are to convince Solskjaer he's ready to make the jump up sooner than expected. His move to the Premier League will be seen as a real coup for United given Madrid's insistence to keep hold of him, while previous interest from Manchester City, Barcelona and across Spain is an indication of his ability. Carreras (Madrid) and Jurado (Barcelona) first rivals and now going to be starting full backs for our academy. https://t.co/nUVvr8Ka12 pic.twitter.com/iyPILiEj7T
