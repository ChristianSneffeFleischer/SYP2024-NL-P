Leicester City will rival Arsenal for the signing of Ryan Bertrand, who is leaving Southampton on a free transfer at the end of the season. Bertrand will bring a seven year spell at St Mary's to a close this summer and leaves having made almost 250 appearances for the club. During his time with the Saints, he helped the club secure a sixth place Premier League finish in 2016 and was also named in the PFA Team of the Year during his first season. Arsenal have been heavily linked with a move for the Champions League winner but according to the Telegraph Leicester are also in the running. Brendan Rodgers is keen to recruit cover at left-back, with the long serving Christian Fuchs set to depart and James Justin still recovering from an ACL injury. Rodgers is a long term admirer of Bertrand, having coached him at youth and reserve level when the pair were both at Chelsea. Leicester favour a 12-month deal, while the defender is hoping to pen longer terms and it is understood that there is room for compromise.
