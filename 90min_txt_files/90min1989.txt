Borussia Monchengladbach manager Daniel Farke has commented on Yann Sommer's future amid links with both Manchester United and Bayern Munich.  The Swiss goalkeeper has been heavily linked with the two sides in recent days as both clubs are in need of some goalkeeping reinforcements.  Bayern are in the market for a goalkeeper after Manuel Neuer was ruled out for the rest of the 2022/23 campaign after breaking his leg during a post-World Cup holiday. The Red Devils, meanwhile, parted with their current second-choice shot-stopper when Martin Dubravka was recalled from his season-long loan by parent club Newcastle United.  Sommer is in the final six months of his current Gladbach contract and is one of the better goalkeepers in Europe right now, which has understandably led to links with both clubs this January. Speaking to the press at Gladbach's winter training camp however, manager Farke insisted that the club have no intention on letting Sommer leave:  "I'm totally relaxed because there are always discussions about good players," Farke said. "He's one of Europe's best goalkeepers. He has a contract until the summer and we have no intention at all of letting him go. "Why should we let such a goalkeeper go? There would have to be very, very good reasons for wanting to let such a quality player go. On the contrary - we want to extend the contract with Yann. There will be talks soon.
