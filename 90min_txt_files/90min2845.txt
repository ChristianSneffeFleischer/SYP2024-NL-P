Timo Werner is set to leave Chelsea and return to Bundesliga outfit RB Leipzig in a permanent deal. The Germany international was one of Europe's form strikers during his time with Die Roten Bullen, scoring 78 league goals in 127 appearances. His final season of 34 strikes in all competition was enough to convince Chelsea of his pedigree as he joined the Blues for  Â£47.5m. However, Werner has not enjoyed the same amount of success at Stamford Bridge, scoring 23 goals in 89 appearances. Despite his rust in front of goal, the 26-year-old has still won the Champions League, Super Cup and Club World Cup with Chelsea. Raheem Sterling has arrived from Manchester City and immediately slotted into Thomas Tuchel's starting XI for the win at Everton on Saturday, with Werner not even making the bench. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  &  Sean Walsh  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Chelsea's plans to sign Wesley Fofana. There's the latest on James Maddison, Jamie Vardy, Cristiano Ronaldo and Frenkie de Jong, and chat on Diogo Jota's new deal and Roberto Firmino's Liverpool future.
