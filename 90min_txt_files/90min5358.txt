Brighton have confirmed the signing of free agent Danny Welbeck on a one-year deal after his contract with Watford was terminated. The decision with the Hornets was a mutual one following their relegation to the Championship last season, leaving the former Manchester United and Arsenal striker free to find a new club outside of the transfer window.        Albion have completed the signing of striker Danny Welbeck. The former Manchester United, Arsenal and Watford forward has agreed a one-year deal with Albion! ? @firsttouchgames ?#BHAFC ?       Welbeck only managed three goals in his 20 matches with Watford, two coming in the Premier League. Not featuring in new boss Vladimir Ivi  's plans for the 2020/21 campaign, Brighton have taken up the option to grant him another crack of the top-flight whip. Speaking on the club's official website, Seagulls' boss Graham Potter insisted Welbeck's experience will be a welcome addition:    We are delighted to have Danny joining us. He will complement our existing striking options.    He   s got an undoubted pedigree, and he is quick and technically very good. He will add to our attacking threat and we are thrilled to add another player of his experience and quality.    Technical director Dan Ashworth added:    I think Danny   s arrival concludes what we feel has been a very good window for the club. A lot of planning, diligence and hard work went into the recruitment side, and I would like to thank all the club   s different departments for their efforts in achieving that.    In a career that has spanned over 320 matches, the 29-year-old has scored 72 goals in club football. His record for the England national team is more than commendable, having netted 16 times in 42 Three Lions' outings. His last cap for Gareth Southgate's men came in 2018.
