Nottingham Forest are the club on course to secure a deal for free agent striker Andre Ayew, who has previously played in the Premier League for Swansea and West Ham, 90min understands. Ayew has been without a club since recently leaving Al-Sadd in Qatar and so the usual rules surrounding transfer windows haven   t applied due to his unattached status. Forest aren   t the only Premier League side that have shown interest in Ayew. As 90min reported, the 33-year-old arrived in England on Wednesday night to hold talks with a number of clubs. Everton, having missed out on a striker in the January window, were one of those keen. West Ham, Bournemouth and Crystal Palace, the latter where younger brother Jordan currently plays, also share interest in the 113-cap Ghana international. Forest look to have beaten Everton to the punch. 90min understands that Ayew has decided he specifically wants to play for Steve Cooper, who has worked miracles at the City Ground. The deal on the table is expected to be an initial six-month contract. Forest have been extraordinarily busy in the transfer market since securing promotion back to the Premier League in May. Ayew stands to be the 30th new permanent or loan signing this season.
