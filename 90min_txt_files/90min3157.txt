Manchester United midfielder Andreas Pereira is to undergo a medical at Fulham ahead of a permanent transfer to Craven Cottage. 90min revealed at the end of June that Fulham had been given permission to discuss personal terms with Pereira, having agreed a fee with United. The 26-year-old has been on loan at Flamengo for the past year, playing a significant role in their league and Copa Libertadores campaigns, and the Brazilian club confirmed earlier in the week that his spell was coming to an end. Flamengo did hold out hope of landing Pereira on a permanent basis, but 90min understands that Pereira is now set to undergo a medical with Fulham - who are back in the Premier League after storming to the Championship title last season.
