Ajax boss Alfred Schreuder has revealed that there has been no change in Manchester United's pursuit of Antony, who continues to push for a move away from the club. The Brazil international has been left out of the matchday squad for Sunday's trip to Utrecht - the second game in a row in which he has been omitted completely. Since then, Ajax have rejected a third bid from United which 90min understands was worth    90m, prompting Antony to speak publicly about his desire to leave the club and further his career with United. With Ajax digging their heels in, United still pushing for a deal and Antony continuing to ask for an exit, Schreuder confessed there was no way the 22-year-old could return to the squad on Sunday. "The Antony situation hasn't changed compared to last week," he told ESPN. "We discuss it internally every day, also with the player.  Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  &  Toby Cudworth  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Lucas Paqueta's potential move to West Ham, Chelsea's plans to sign Anthony Gordon, Wesley Fofana and Arsen Zakharyan and the latest from Old Trafford.
