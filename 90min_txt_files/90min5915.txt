Tottenham have knocked back an undisclosed bid from AC Milan for Serge Aurier. Jose Mourinho is fine tuning his Spurs squad for the coming campaign in what is his first summer window since taking over at the club, with Pierre-Emile H  jbjerg already joining the club from Southampton.

A post shared by  Thecrazychild93 (@sergeaurier) on Jul 31, 2020 at 7:26am PDT With players incoming, others are set to depart and Aurier has been deemed surplus to requirements at Spurs. It speaks volumes of his standing under Mourinho when he's actively being sold despite being the only recognised right-back at the club (at present). As per Sky Sports, Milan are the side trying hardest to lure him away from the Premier League, having had a bid for the Ivorian knocked back. There is no disclosure of the bid itself, but it is expected that Spurs would look to recuperate close to the  £23m they spent to bring him in from Paris Saint-Germain in 2017. Bayer Leverkusen are also thought to be sniffing around a deal - Aurier earns in the region of  £70k-per-week and still has two years left on his current contract. At present, I Rossoneri and Tottenham are thought to be some way apart in their own valuations. Presumably, Spurs think he's worth more than Milan do. It is expected that Milan will return with a second bid in the coming days, as Daniel Levy attempts to wrangle as much money as possible out interested parties for 27-year-old Aurier, who featured 33 times in the Premier League last season.
