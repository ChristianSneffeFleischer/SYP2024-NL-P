Crystal Palace have identified Vitesse Arnhem's Max Clark as a transfer target as they look to strengthen their left back options before the transfer window closes. The Eagles have already concluded some impressive business this summer in an attempt to rejuvenate their ageing squad, but the left back position remains a weak spot with Patrick van Aanholt injured and inside the final 12 months of his contract. While youngster Tyrick Mitchell has impressed as first-choice so far this season, the Daily Mail report that Clark has been identified as a transfer target by Palace, with the club considering their options ahead of the deadline. Palace are without an experienced left back after Van Aanholt suffered a dislocated shoulder against Manchester United towards the end of last season and is yet to return to action. The Dutchman's contract is set to expire next summer and he is also now 30 years old, meaning his best years are likely behind him. Clark joined Vitesse in 2018 after rejecting a new deal at Hull City, where he had come through the academy ranks before spending two seasons on loan at Cambridge United. At just 24, the Englishman would be the ideal man to ease the workload on Mitchell and provide decent quality to the team without breaking the bank.
