AC Milan centre-back Fikayo Tomori is attracting plenty of interest from a number of Premier League sides, 90min understands. Tomori swapped Chelsea for Milan in 2021 and has enjoyed a sensational few years in Serie A, winning the league title in 2021/22 and helping to steer the Rossoneri to the semi-final of this season's Champions League. Saturday's 1-1 draw with Roma was attended by numerous scouts from across England who were keeping an eye on several players. Roma striker Tammy Abraham was a primary focus but sources have confirmed to 90min that Tomori was a key target for many. The 25-year-old only managed 45 minutes of action, picking up an injury and being replaced at half-time, but there was still time for scouts to update their reports of Tomori. 90min understands that Arsenal, Manchester United and Newcastle were all paying close attention to Tomori during the game, while former employers Chelsea were also watching their former academy star's progress. Liverpool are not believed to have been represented at the game but the Reds are known admirers of Tomori as well. feed Sources state that Tomori would be interested in a return to the Premier League as he believes such a move would aid his quest to feature regularly for the England national team. Despite loud calls from England fans, Tomori has not featured for England since June 2022 and has just three caps to his name, and he was not part of the squad for the 2022 World Cup just six months after winning the Serie A title.    There was a disappointment not going to the World Cup but that's football, you just have to move on,    said Tomori after his omission from the tournament was confirmed. 90min understands that Tomori sees a return to the Premier League as the best route to more minutes for his country and he would consider offers to return this summer.
