Barcelona manager Xavi has revealed that a midfielder is the club's top priority for the summer transfer window.  Contrary to the expectations of many fans, who believed Barcelona would prioritise a right-back signing to address the ongoing positional issue, Xavi has revealed that their primary concern lies in bolstering the midfield. This decision stems from the imminent departure of the club's long-serving captain Sergio Busquets, who will bid farewell to Barcelona after an illustrious 15-year tenure. Jules Kounde has been filling in at right-back for a significant portion of the season, highlighting the pressing need for reinforcement in that position. However, Xavi's focus remains steadfast on revitalising the midfield unit, recognising the impact of Busquets' imminent departure on the team dynamics. "Busi is leaving, and we need a high-level defensive midfielder. An important, differential footballer is leaving us. And we have to replace him. The more we strengthen ourselves, we   ll be more competitive," Xavi told reporters.  The Barcelona manager also addressed recent criticism from Real Sociedad's sporting director, Robert Fernandez, who condemned Xavi for discussing midfielder Martin Zubimendi.     The Real Sociedad sporting director was angry because I talked about Zubimendi, but it is you who ask me about him. I don   t want to destabilise any other teams." Real Sociedad boss Imanol Alguacil has recently relayed his confidence that Zubimendi will not leave the club in the summer, saying: "I know what Zubimendi thinks and wants. I have no doubt he wants to play in the Champions League with us next year. Zubimendi has a contract with us, it   s the best place he can be, and he wants to be with us.    Xavi was also asked about Joshua Kimmich as a target for Barcelona this summer, and he said: "Kimmich is spectacular in my opinion, one of the best in his position.
