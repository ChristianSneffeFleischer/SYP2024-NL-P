Mason Mount has posted a farewell message to Chelsea fans, confirming his departure from the club ahead of a transfer announcement from new team Manchester United. With Mount entering the final year of his Chelsea contract and no agreement reached over a new one, the Blues eventually accepted a  £55m plus  £5m offer from Manchester United. The 24-year-old had already come to an agreement over personal terms and has since completed a medical and finalised the move at United   s Carrington training base. A photographer also captured images of Mount in Cheshire shortly before reporting back to Carrington for club media duties. But in a video message posted on Instagram, Mount wanted to directly address Chelsea fans before being publicly unveiled as a Manchester United player. "Given the speculation over the last six months, this may not come as a surprise to you. But it doesn't make it any easier to tell you that I've made the decision to leave Chelsea," he said. feed A post shared by Mason Mount (@masonmount) Mount explained that he thought supporters 'deserve more than a written statement'. He went on to add, "I know some of you won't be happy with my decision, but it's what right for me at this moment in my career. I joined Chelsea when I was six years old and we've been through a lot together     winning the [FA] Youth Cup, my player of the year awards, the Super Cup, the Club World Cup, and of course that unforgettable night when we won the Champions League." The player singled out staff at the Chelsea academy, as well Frank Lampard, Thomas Tuchel and Graham Potter, his teammates, family and the fans. He also reserved special praise for the club   s backroom staff, referring to them as the 'unsung heroes of Cobham'.
