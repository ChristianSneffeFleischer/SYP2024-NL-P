Jorginho says the Arsenal squad have no clue when the signings of Declan Rice and Jurrien Timber will be announced. The Gunners have confirmed the arrival of Kai Havertz from Chelsea while deals are close to completion for England and Netherlands internationals Rice and Timber. A British record  Â£105m transfer for Rice has been agreed with West Ham after Arsenal saw off competition from Manchester City, while a full agreement for defender Timber which could ultimately be worth around    47m has also been reached. However, the two moves are yet to be confirmed and Jorginho, himself a January arrival from Chelsea earlier this year, told fans on social media he is in the dark over when the two newbies will touch down at the Emirates. feed When asked by a supporter on The Residency: "Jorginho, when are Rice and Timber joining?" The Italy international replied: "Good question. No idea." With Granit Xhaka off to Bayer Leverkusen and the future of Thomas Partey up in the air after a mixed campaign, Rice is expected to fit straight into Arsenal's starting XI. The Europa Conference League winner could partner Martin Odegaard and Kai Havertz in midfield, though the Gunners remain interested in bringing in another midfielder. Mikel Arteta's side are among the teams tracking Southampton starlet Romeo Lavia. The Belgium international was a bright spark in Southampton's dire 2022/23 season and is expected to depart St. Mary's with Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Newcastle also interested. The Gunners had tried to swoop for Brighton's Ecuador international Moises Caicedo in January before pivoting for Jorginho, with a high price tag meaning a deal couldn't be done. Chelsea have since stepped up their interest and prepared an opening bid for the 21-year-old.
