Tottenham Hotspur are hoping to sign a new centre-back during the summer transfer window, with new head coach Ange Postecoglou approving of the plans, sources have told 90min. Spurs endured a miserable 2022/23 season, sacking head coach Antonio Conte and then interim boss Cristian Stellini down the final stretch of another campaign without a trophy. Their eighth-placed finish was the club's lowest since 2008/09, while Tottenham became the first team in 15 years to both score and concede more than 60 goals in a Premier League season. Understandably, Spurs have hopes of strengthening their defensive core ahead of the 2023/24 campaign. 90min understands that incoming boss Postecoglou has been consulted on the club's transfer plans and has given his approval to sign a new centre-back. manual Tottenham currently have three defenders at the top of their shortlist, with the standout name being Manchester United captain Harry Maguire. 90min reported in April that the England international has been offered to clubs in Serie A and that his preference should he leave Man Utd would be to a move to Italy. Manchester City's Aymeric Laporte, who lost his place as a regular starter during the 2022/23 season, is also high on Spurs' shortlist. 90min previously reported that Tottenham and PSG had been offered the chance to sign the Spain international this summer, though they have now been joined in the race by Aston Villa. Wolves' Max Kilman has long had admirers in north London and he remains a target for Tottenham. LISTEN NOW
