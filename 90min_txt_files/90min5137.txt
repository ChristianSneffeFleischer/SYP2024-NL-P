Wolves have been offered the opportunity to sign former Brazil international Hulk as a replacement for the injured Raul Jimenez. Jimenez is set for a lengthy spell on the sidelines after he suffered a fractured skull during a sickening head collision with David Luiz during Wolves' Premier League clash with Arsenal in November. Some good news from over the weekend...Raul Jimenez has been discharged from hospital and is now resting at home with his family.#FuerzaRaul pic.twitter.com/0kjC54TqXG Wolves are poised to enter the market for a striker in January in order to fill the void left by Jimenez - who has been the club's top scorer in each of his two seasons at Molineux. According to Football Insider, Nuno Espirito Santo has been informed that Hulk would be interested in a move to the Premier League following the conclusion of his four-year spell with Shanghai SIPG. The 34-year-old left the Chinese Super League outfit in December following the completion of their season and would subsequently be available on a free transfer. The lack of transfer fee could instead supplement a substantial wage package, with the former Porto man pocketing  £385,000-per-week with Shanghai. However, according to the Record, Hulk would be prepared to take a 90% wage cut in order to secure a move to the Premier League. The forward would be willing to reduce his salary to  £48,000-a-week - and is not short on offers around the world after opting to not renew his stay in China.
