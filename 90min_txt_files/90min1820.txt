Wolverhampton Wanderers have agreed a deal with West Ham United for central defender Craig Dawson, 90min understands. Wolves had been keen to land Dawson in the summer, with the player himself being keen to move back further north to be closer to his family, but that deal failed to materialise. Now however, Wolves have returned and have hammered out a deal with West Ham which is worth just over  Â£3m. The 32-year-old had just six months left on his current deal at the London Stadium, and he made it known that due to his family he was not going to sign an extension. West Ham boss David Moyes spoke last week about how unimpressed he was by Wolves' approach for Dawson ahead of their game at Molineux - which the home side ended up winning.
