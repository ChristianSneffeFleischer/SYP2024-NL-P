Real Madrid may be willing to sell Marco Asensio for a fee of around    30m this summer, according to a report in Italy. Asensio has made close to 230 appearances for Real Madrid in all competitions but has just a year remaining on his contract - with talks over an extension yet to yield an agreement. The Spaniard, who has scored 10 goals in 35 appearances during 2021/22, isn't guaranteed a place in Carlo Ancelotti's starting XI and his agent recently talked up interest from Arsenal and AC Milan, stating Asensio would be willing to consider a move away from the Bernabeu. Italian news outlet Calciomercato now suggest that Real will consider selling Asensio if they receive an offer between    25m and    30m - with Milan said to be particularly interested in the 26-year-old as they see him as an upgrade on current right wing options Alexis Saelemaekers and Junior Messias.
