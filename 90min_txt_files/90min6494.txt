Arsenal are keen on signing Porto midfielder Danilo Pereira this summer and are set to explore the possibility of a move in the coming weeks.  Mikel Arteta is eager to add another midfielder to his ranks ahead of next season but will have to work with a limited budget as a result of the financial strains brought about by COVID-19.  The Gunners have constantly been linked with a move for Atletico's Thomas Partey in a  Â£45m deal but could look instead at cheaper alternatives given the player's release clause - one being Porto's Danilo.  The 28-year-old has a similarly hefty    60m release clause in his contract, but ESPN understands the Portuguese giants are willing to offload him for around a third of the price given pressures related to meeting UEFA's financial fair play requirements. Danilo has been a key figure at Porto ever since his 2015 move from Maritimo. He's won the Portuguese title just once but his side currently hold a three-point over Benfica in the title race this term with just six games remaining.  While a Portugal international and sound performer in the middle of the park, it's his experience which had led to Arteta taking an interest. The Spaniard is hopeful Danilo will add maturity and leadership to a young squad akin to David Luiz and Cedric Soares - who recently signed contract extensions at the Emirates.
