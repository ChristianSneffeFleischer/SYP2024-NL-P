Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has reportedly held a 'secret meeting' with Bayern Munich and Liverpool-linked midfielder Thiago Alcantara. The Spaniard enjoyed a sensational 2019/20 campaign which culminated in Champions League glory in Lisbon last month to secure Bayern's second treble in seven years, but is nonetheless keen to depart Bavaria this summer in favour of a new challenge. Premier League champions Liverpool have been touted to sign the Bayern man, with the Germans said to 'convinced' that the Reds will make an offer soon following weeks of links.  Die Roten are currently holding out for an offer of    30m for the 29-year-old, with the future of Georginio Wijnaldum - who has one year left on his Liverpool contract and is yet to agree on an extension - understood to be key in the Reds' pursuit of Thiago.  However, much like how Chelsea swooped in to sign Timo Werner after Liverpool cooled their interest in the German, Manchester United have emerged as an alternative destination for the majestic midfielder.  Norwegian journalist Fredrik Flitvedt reports that Solskjaer has already spoken to Thiago about a potential switch to Old Trafford.  "Solskjaer has talked to Thiago in person. But so far the wage demand is too high. Too loud," he tweeted. "Solskjaer is interested in signings such as will play for United for the 'right reasons' and not because of money." Despite wage demands seemingly a sticking point, Liverpool's reluctance to wrap up a deal leaves the door open for United.  The Red Devils completed the    39m signing of Ajax midfielder Donny van de Beek on Wednesday evening on a five-year deal, and the club are still searching for further reinforcements.  The addition of Donny van de Beek will only strengthen Manchester United's midfield options. ?
