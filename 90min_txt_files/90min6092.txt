Real Madrid have agreed to loan Takefusa Kubo to La Liga rivals Villarreal for the 2020/21 season.  The 19-year-old Japan international has long been tipped as a future star of European football and impressed in his first full season as a senior pro while on loan at Mallorca in 2019/20. According to Spanish newspaper AS, Villarreal, who finished the extended 2019/20 season in fifth position beat the likes of Celta Vigo, Osasuna and Granada to Kubo's signature for the upcoming campaign.  The diminutive teenager may have been unable to prevent Mallorca's relegation to the Segunda Divisi  n, but he did contribute four goals and five assists in 35 league appearances. It is reported that Madrid consider their former Barcelona starlet to be one of their most exciting young prospects but they need to wait another year before he can be included in their La Liga squad. Regulations stipulate that Spanish sides are only allowed to include three non-EU players and with Vinicius Junior not expected to acquire an EU passport until next season, Kubo must spend another campaign away from the Bernabeu.  However, such is their faith in Kubo's ability, Los Blancos have refused to even contemplate the possibility of including an option to buy in the deal with Villarreal - who will be solely responsible for the 19-year-old's wages.
