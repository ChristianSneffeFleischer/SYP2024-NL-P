Ligue 1 side Marseille are reportedly working hard to encourage winger Florian Thauvin to sign a new contract at the club. Thauvin has spent the last four-and-a-half seasons at Marseille, scoring 66 times in all competitions. The Frenchman has made a fine start to the new campaign, scoring three and assisting a further four in seven league appearances. The 27-year-old's current contract ends in the summer, meaning he could be free to start talking to other clubs from January onwards. Premier League sides Leicester City and Aston Villa have both been linked with a move for the winger. Marseille sporting director Pablo Longoria has spoken of the club's desire to keep him at the club, but admits that a deal is yet to be reached.     Thauvin is a club heritage, that   s why it   s hard to lose an important player like him,    said Longoria, via Leicester Mercury.    He will be free to agree terms with another club [in January] and that   s why we all have to work together     club, player, entourage     to find the best solution.    If the winger, who was part of France's World Cup-winning squad in 2018, was to transfer to England, it wouldn't be his first experience in the Premier League.  Thauvin previously endured a frustrating spell at Newcastle United, signing for the Magpies in 2015 for a reported  Â£15m fee. He scored just one goal in 16 outings before returning to Marseille six months later.
