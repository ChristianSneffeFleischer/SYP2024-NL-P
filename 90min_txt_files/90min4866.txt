Barcelona still owe Liverpool almost    70m for Philippe Coutinho, who made the switch to Camp Nou from Anfield three years ago and has since been loaned out to - and returned from - Bayern Munich. Liverpool are due    29m of that amount in the short-term and have invoiced Bar  a accordingly, but it appears the Reds are not the only ones waiting on money from the Catalan giants. Astonishingly,  there are 19 clubs in total, with Juventus owed sums for two players, and a monumental transfer debt of    323m. #FCBarcelona transfer fees debt rose from    261m to    323m, up from    64m in 2017. Net payables of    155m after considering    168m owed by other clubs. Mainly owed for Coutinho (Liverpool)    69m, De Jong (Ajax)    64m and Pjanic (Juventus)    58m. Already highest in Europe in 2019. pic.twitter.com/b8jQeGkynA The figures are disclosed in Barcelona   s latest accounts and they owe    126m on the outstanding transfers in the short-term and a further    197m in future commitments beyond the period in question. Even though deals are often negotiated to include instalments and staggered payments, it is an astronomical level of transfer debt to have accumulated. Coutinho is the largest single short-term amount owed at just over    29m. The  £142m fee that Liverpool agreed to sell for in December 2018 was heavily inflated by add-ons, with only  £105m of that figure actually a guaranteed price. But it was reported recently that all the add-ons have finally been triggered after the Brazilian player his 90th game for Bar  a. However, that doesn   t mean Liverpool have automatically been paid the full sum. Beyond the    29m, there is another    40m due in the future. Barcelona have released their official accounts - they owe 19 clubs a total of    126m for outstanding payments on transfers. The largest sum is the    29m they must pay Liverpool for the transfer of Philippe Coutinho. pic.twitter.com/mjjhoYGkP8 What is more startling from a Barcelona perspective is that there are still sizeable outstanding debts     both short-term and long-term     on players they have already sold. Malcom wasn   t deemed good enough after only 24 appearances and joined Zenit St Petersburg for around the same    40m fee he was bought for. Yet Barca still owe almost    10m to Bordeaux in the short-term and another    10m in the long-term. Similarly, Barca sold Arthur to Juventus last summer, but are still liable for almost    8m to Gremio now and then a further    13.5m. The Brazilian was sold in a part-exchange deal with Miralem Pjanic to help balance the books for last season, with Juventus owed just under    5m for the Bosnian international immediately and almost    60m in total. Barca triggered a buy-back clause for Denis Suarez in 2016 to re-sign him from Villarreal. That deal wasn   t thought to be worth more than    3.5m, but it appears that    241,000 and a further    482,000 is still owed nearly five years on. Suarez was sold to Celta Vigo for    16m around 18 months ago. The Catalans are yet to pay most of the money for Frenkie de Jong, whose    75m transfer was completed in the summer of 2019. In the short-term    16m is owed to Ajax, and    48m in the long-term. It would appear that Bar  a have hardly made a dent in the original fee. Barcelona   s finances have been the subject of much coverage in recent weeks. Presidential candidate Victor Font admitted at the end of last year that the situation is    critical   , with the club   s overall debt now thought to be north of    800m.
