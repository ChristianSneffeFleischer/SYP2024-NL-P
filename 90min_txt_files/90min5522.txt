Tottenham Hotspur have dismissed a  £1.5m bid from Paris Saint-Germain to take Dele Alli on loan, and will now give the midfielder an opportunity to work his way back into Jos   Mourinho's plans.  Dele has been an enigmatic figure under Mourinho so far, but has fallen firmly out of favour with the Portuguese boss this season. He's played just 45 minutes of domestic football, and those came on the opening day of the Premier League season, in which he was subbed at half-time.  Naturally, his lack of involvement has led to speculation over his future, and the club were reported to have offered the 24-year-old to PSG. When he emerged from the bench to score in Thursday's 7-2 victory over Maccabi Haifa, then, some concluded that it may have been his parting gift to the club who gave him his big break.  On repeat... ?#THFC        #COYS pic.twitter.com/EKP4LBN6gc If The Guardian are to be believed, however, his role in Spurs reaching the Europa League group stages may instead mark the beginning of a resurgence. They note that PSG's bid,  £1.5m for a 12-month loan, has been rejected, with Dele now set to stay at the club and fight for his place for the remainder of the season.  With the benefit of hindsight, Mourinho's comments ahead of Thursday's resounding win might have suggested this was coming. He was full of praise for Dele's professionalism and attitude, in what he concedes has been a difficult time for the midfielder.  ? @dele_official         #THFC 7-2 #MHFC ? pic.twitter.com/ttwcnR8L3q
