Barcelona manager Xavi has insisted Raphinha is not for sale this summer, despite Arsenal keeping a close eye on the Brazilian's situation at Camp Nou. With ambitious and expensive plans this summer, including the re-signing of Lionel Messi, Barcelona are aware that some players will have to be sold this summer. 90min understands Arsenal are keeping a close eye on the availability of both Raphinha and Ferran Torres. The Gunners tried to sign Raphinha when he left Leeds United last summer and also made a tentative enquiry about his services during the January transfer window, and the 26-year-old remains on their radar. Unfortunately for Arsenal, it appears they will have to look elsewhere as manager Xavi has insisted Raphinha will not be leaving Camp Nou this summer. "Raphinha is not on the market," Xavi told the media. "He   s staying at Barcelona and will help us a lot. He   s a crucial player for me and a really important player. He makes the difference." feed Raphinha has been a regular on the right side of Xavi's attack this season, racking up ten goals and 12 assists in 49 appearances ahead of the season finale against Celta Vigo on Sunday. It was on that same right wing that Messi made his name at Camp Nou and so, with the veteran Argentine in line for a possible return this summer, questions have been raised about Raphinha's place in the team if Messi does join. However, Xavi has already made it clear that Messi may no longer be a winger, recently revealing his plans to fit the World Cup winner into his team. While Raphinha's place at Camp Nou appears safe, there are doubts over the future of Torres, another Arsenal target, and 20-year-old Ansu Fati.
