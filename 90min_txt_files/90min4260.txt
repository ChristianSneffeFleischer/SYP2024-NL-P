Tottenham are keen to add at least one centre-back to their squad this summer and have identified Jules Kounde and Joachim Andersen as two of their targets. Scoring goals didn't prove to be a problem for Spurs last season with the talents of Harry Kane and Son Heung-min leading the line. Only the top two teams in the 2020/21 Premier League campaign - Manchester's City and United - scored more than the north Londoners, but their leaky defence cost them dearly. Tottenham would undoubtedly have finished higher than seventh were it not for their shaky backline, with Davinson Sanchez and Eric Dier in particular seemingly unable to eradicate careless errors from their games. Despite being without a manager as Daniel Levy's hunt for a new boss goes on, the club are going about their transfer business as normal and centre-back reinforcements is at the top of their priority list. The Guardian report that Kounde and Andersen are among the centre-backs being considered, with both players understood to be open to a move away from their respective clubs. Kounde has attracted interest from some of European football's top sides over recent months, with Manchester United in particular monitoring his performances. The Frenchman has previously stated his desire to "play for an even bigger club" than current employers Sevilla, and reports suggest they could sell their prized asset for less than his    80m ( Â£69m) release clause.
