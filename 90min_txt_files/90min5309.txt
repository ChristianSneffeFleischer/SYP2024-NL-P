Manchester City are 'preparing' an offer in the region of    40m for Borussia M  nchengladbach midfielder Denis Zakaria, with the Citizens expected to make their move next summer.  With Fernandinho's contract due to expire next summer and Rodri still struggling to control games, Pep Guardiola is in need of reinforcements at the base of his midfield. Ilkay Gundogan can drop in, but he's more effective when operating slightly further up the field. Christian Falk of Sport Bild reports that Gladbach's Zakaria has been identified by City as the player to strengthen in the defensive midfield department. In fact, City are preparing to make their move for the 23-year-old next summer, and will submit an offer of around    40m with the hope of securing his services.  Zakaria has been out of action for the Bundesliga outfit since March due to a knee injury which has continued to trouble him. Indeed, Gladbach have missed the powerful enforcer during his time off, not only because of his ability to read the game and sniff out danger, but also because he's able to drive forward and link up with those around him.

While no move ever materialised, it has been said Manchester United, Chelsea and Bayern Munich are all still keeping a close eye on him.
