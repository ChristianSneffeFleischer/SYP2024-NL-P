Highly-rated Manchester City youngster James McAtee has joined Sheffield United on a season-long loan deal. The 19-year-old made his senior debut for Man City last season and will now get more senior football experience in the Championship with the Blades. Speaking to Sheffield United's official website after making the move, McAtee said: "I'm looking forward to the challenge, I've been building up to a loan for a few years now and I think I'm ready. "Paul [Heckingbottom] was a lovely guy to meet, he showed me around and made me feel welcome. He was telling me about how he sees me playing and that's how I see it too. The way Sheffield United play suits me and hopefully I can help with creative options. Manchester City are obviously happy with the club, they want me to get some game time and experience."
