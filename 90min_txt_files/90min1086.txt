Mason Mount is set for a meeting with Chelsea's hierarchy next week regarding his future at the club, 90min understands. The 24-year-old midfielder is entering the final 12 months of his current deal at Stamford Bridge, and the club have been embroiled in lengthy discussions with the player regarding a contract extensions. The delay in a new deal being agreed upon has sparked interest from Liverpool, and 90min also understands that Arsenal have registered their interest with Mount's representatives. Manchester United has also been thrown into the mix regarding a potential  Â£55m bid for Mount, while sources have stated that Newcastle United, who secured UEFA Champions League qualification on Monday, are keeping an eye on how negotiations are panning out. Chelsea's imminent appointment of Mauricio Pochettino has led to new confidence at the Blues that Mount will indeed rebuke interest from elsewhere to sign a new long-term deal. In light of Pochettino's proposed hiring, 90min recently reported that the club had planned to accelerate talks with Mount's representatives, and they will sit down with the midfielder next week. feed Pochettino is believed to be a huge fan of Mount and wants him to be a part of his Chelsea project moving forward. The England international has struggled with form and fitness this season as the Blues have woefully underperformed under three different managers. In just 20 Premier League starts, the midfielder has managed a measly three goals and two assists. Prior to this season's woes, however, Mount was one of Chelsea's most consistent performers, winning the club's player of the year award in 2020/21 and 2021/22.
