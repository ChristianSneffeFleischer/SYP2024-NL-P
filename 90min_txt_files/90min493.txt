Real Madrid and Federico Valverde are not looking to part ways this summer, despite strong interest in the versatile Uruguay star, 90min understands. Valverde is widely regarded as one of Real's most important players following a breakout season, but speculation over his future has ensued given summer arrivals of Jude Bellingham and Arda Guler, and the ongoing possibity of also signing PSG superstar Kylian Mbappe. Yet sources close to Real have insisted to 90min that selling the 24-year-old is not in their plans. They would not entertain a sale any time soon and point to the fact he has a    1bn release clause in his current contract that runs until 2027. feed Real's stance on the matter has still not stopped other clubs taking an interest and asking about his availability. 90min understands that Liverpool, Chelsea and Manchester City have enquired this summer, along with Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain - but none of those informal approaches were received positively and were immediately dismissed. Valverde's representatives have also been contacted by the interested parties, but they have been quick to relay the message straight from the player that he has no desire to move. Valverde's wife has just given birth to their second child and he has no desire to uproot his family out of Madrid. A sources close to the player has also informed 90min that he one day sees himself as a future Real captain and that he could imagine spending the rest of his career with the Spanish giants - that potentially means another decade or more at the Santiago Bernabeu. Valverde has been with Madrid for seven years already after joining them from Penarol and has already amassed more than 200 appearances since making his first-team debut in 2018.
