Manchester United have confirmed defender Alex Telles has left Old Trafford to join Al Nassr on a permanent deal. The Brazil international made 50 appearances in all competitions and scored once for the Red Devils after signing from Porto in 2020, vying with Luke Shaw for the left back position. However, the England international soon nailed that spot down and Telles spent the 2022/23 campaign on loan with Sevilla, winning the Europa League. feed He will now reunite with Cristiano Ronaldo, who famously left Man Utd before the 2022 World Cup and later signed for Al Nassr as one of the first major players to move to the Middle East. The deal to take Telles to Al Nassr had stalled, with the defender previously thought to be keen on returning to Brazil with Flamego instead of moving to Saudi Arabia.  He will join fellow new arrivals Seko Fofana and Marcelo Brozovic in Riyadh as well as Ronaldo and former Arsenal goalkeeper David Ospina.
