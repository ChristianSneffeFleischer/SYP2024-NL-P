Inter were unable to complete a deal to sign former Juventus player Paulo Dybala due to their inability to agree terms with Alexis Sanchez over contract termination, 90min understands.  I Nerrazurri had been long expected to sign Dybala, who was a free agent after failing to agree terms on a new deal at Juventus, but were forced to put the brakes on a deal in recent weeks due to the need to balance their books before bringing the mercurial forward to the club.  90min reported last week that Inter were keen to terminate the contracts of the highly paid Arturo Vidal and Sanchez, and sell one of Edin Dzeko or Joaquin Correa. While they were able to shift Vidal - who has now joined Flamengo - the club were unable to do so with Sanchez.  We understand that the club entered talks with Sanchez's representatives over the weekend but weren't able to come to terms on any severance deal.  Due to Inter's stalling of their move for Dybala, AS Roma were able to swoop in and agree terms with the player - despite I Giallorossi's contract offer being less than Inter had been offering.
