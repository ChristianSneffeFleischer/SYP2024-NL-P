Real Madrid stars Vinicius Junior and Eder Militao have added fuel to the fire surrounding Kylian Mbappe's future with a message to Madrid chief scout Juni Calafat. Mbappe has been made available for transfer this summer after declining to trigger the extension in his current Paris Saint-Germain contract, which now expires next summer. Real Madrid are long-term admirers of Mbappe and are planning to secure the Frenchman's signature either this summer or next year on a free transfer, while PSG have attempted to drum up interest from elsewhere to ensure they do not lost their talisman for nothing.  A world record bid from Al Hilal was accepted by the club but rejected by Mbappe himself, while Premier League sides like Chelsea have been contacted but are not confident of convincing the Frenchman, whose focus remains on Madrid. While an official offer from Madrid is yet to arrive, a number of players have taken the opportunity to fuel the speculation, with winger Rodrygo posting a picture alongside Mbappe last week with no caption. feed Now, Vinicius and Militao have continued to tease fans after a video emerged (via GOAL) with the duo telling chief scout Calafat: "We hope [Mbappe] will come. Juni has to sign him." Calafat responded to the duo, joking: "You are spending all our money in Ibiza. We   ll no longer have enough for Mbappe." PSG have returned to France to finalise their preparations for the upcoming Ligue 1 season and face a decision over what to do with Mbappe, who has been training with a group of transfer-listed players and has not yet worked under new manager Luis Enrique. The Parisians will get their season underway on Saturday when they welcome Lorient to Parc des Princes.
