Columbus Crew have signed free agent Steven Moreira on a deal until the end of the season.   Moreira has been without a club since his Toulouse contract expired at the end of last season. Prior to that he made 68 appearances for the club, also enjoying spells with Lorient and Rennes earlier in his career.

Last season he made 30 Ligue 2 appearances, providing four assists as Toulouse lost in the play-offs to Nantes.   Speaking to the club   s website,   President & General Manager Tim Bezbatchenko said he was delighted with the signing.      We are excited to welcome Steven to the Crew,    he said.      Steven is a dynamic defender who is entering the prime of his career, and we believe his addition will help strengthen our backline on both sides of the ball. As someone who has regularly played in one of the top leagues in the world, we are pleased he has chosen the Crew and we look forward to incorporating him into the team.    Moreira will be added to the roster pending receipt of his International Transfer Certificate and P-1 Visa. He will occupy an international roster slot, but has not been added as a designated player.  It is believed Moreira's contract includes an option to extend his stay by a further two seasons.
