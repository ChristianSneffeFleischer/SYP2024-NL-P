Barcelona president Joan Laporta has claimed that he has rebuilt his relationship with Lionel Messi, who wants to return to Camp Nou this summer. Messi is approaching the final month of his contract with Paris Saint-Germain and has long been in negotiations over an emotional return to Barcelona, who hope to receive the financial clearance from La Liga to announce a deal soon. Having sealed the La Liga title on Sunday night, Barcelona's attention is now firmly on transfer business, with Messi's return the top priority. "We will do everything we can to bring Leo Messi back to Barcelona," Laporta told Jijantes FC in the immediate aftermath of the title triumph. On Monday morning, Laporta went further into his pursuit of Messi during an appearance on TV3, insisting the Argentine is pushing for a return to Camp Nou as well despite an enormous offer to move to Saudi Arabia. feed "Leo is still in Paris in an unpleasant situation, I wouldn't want to bother him now," Laporta said. "We will try to improve the team all over. "I have spoken with Messi to address the situation. It was very nice. We have recovered our relationship. Messi wants Barca, he feels this club is his home, but speaking now would do him a disservice. "Saudi Arabia? Barca is Barca. In Arabia they are doing a good job and investing, but I insist, Barca is his home." Barcelona must lower their wage bill before they can make any further signings, and they have submitted a feasibility plan to La Liga in an attempt to prove their ability to get back under the salary cap. Sergio Busquets' imminent departure from Camp Nou will free up plenty of space on the wage budget, while a number of other players are also expected to be available for transfer in an attempt to raise more money.
