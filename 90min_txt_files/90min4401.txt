Southampton left-back Ryan Bertrand is on the verge of joining Leicester with a one-year deal close to being agreed. The former Chelsea man recently revealed he would be leaving the Saints after seven seasons with the south coast club. Bertrand has made over 200 Premier League appearances for Southampton and very nearly helped the club to League Cup glory in 2017 before they were denied by a late Zlatan Ibrahimovic goal against Manchester United. With his contract expiring in the summer and no news of a renewed deal forthcoming, Bertrand has been linked with a number of Premier League sides, with Arsenal in particular keen to bring him to north London. However, after Leicester emerged as favourites to secure his signature just a few days ago, TalkSport now report that Bertrand is nearing a move to the Foxes and will pen a one-year deal with the club. Brendan Rodgers already has a number of options at left-back with Luke Thomas, James Justin and Timothy Castagne all capable of playing on the left-hand side, though Bertrand is seen as good competition for the club's current crop of full-backs. While the 31-year-old doesn't really fit the expected profile of a Leicester signing, Rodgers is a long-term admirer of the Champions League winner with the pair having worked together during their time at Chelsea.
