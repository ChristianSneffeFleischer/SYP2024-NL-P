Manchester United are potentially one of the 'main options' for Real Madrid playmaker James Rodr  guez, as the player seeks to secure an exit from the club. The Colombian has been rumoured for an exit from the Spanish capital for a number of seasons having struggled to force his way into Zinedine Zidane's plans, while he also spent time out on loan at Bayern Munich. The 28-year-old was plucked from Monaco after a stellar 2014 World Cup performance, yet has failed miserably to live up to the hype that surrounded his move to the Santiago Bernabeu. After six seasons at the club however, it appears that time is up for the former Porto midfielder, with Spanish outlet Sport (via Sports Witness) reporting that there are a number of options for him to choose from in terms of his next destination - with United one of them. The report suggests that with the player only having one year remaining on his contract, the Red Devils would seek to take advantage and negotiate a 'reduced rate'. This would also allow the club to then be able to afford close to the    7.75m a year wage that he is currently earning in the Spanish capital.        ?
