Brentford goalkeeper David Raya has insisted that he wants to compete for titles and play in Europe, while he revealed why he turned down two offers of a new contract from the Bees. Since Brentford's promotion to the Premier League in 2021, Raya has established himself as one of the division's top stoppers. The 27-year-old has been capped twice by Spain and was part of their squad for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, despite being a relative unknown in his home country having spent his whole professional career in England. But Raya's time at Brentford could be coming to an end. 90min understands that he is the subject of interest from Chelsea, Manchester United and Tottenham, as well as La Liga giants Atletico Madrid. In an interview with The Athletic, Raya opened up on why he has rejected two contract offers from Brentford and outlined his future ambitions.

I can only say that," Raya began. "I want to focus on playing games and not think too much about my future. I have a contract here, so I   m willing to finish that, but you never know what   s going to happen in the summer. Maybe the club wants to sell, maybe not. Maybe I want to stay. I want to focus on football and see what happens.
