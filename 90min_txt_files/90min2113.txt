PSV Eindhoven manager Ruud van Nistelrooy has admitted he may be powerless to prevent World Cup star Cody Gakpo from leaving the club soon. Gakpo starred for the Netherlands in Qatar before they were knocked out on penalties by Argentina in the quarter finals, scoring three times in the group stage. 90min reported earlier this week PSV now expect to lose Gakpo in the January transfer window, with Manchester United leading the chasing pack over the last couple of months. However, a deal is yet to be done and the Dutch side could agree terms with any team. PSV director of football Marcel Brands revealed Gakpo could leave for a club-record selling fee and manager Van Nistelrooy has added that there may come an offer which is too good to turn down. He told Voetbal International: "If I have the choice, I prefer [Gakpo to leave in] the summer, but it can also be now. You just know there comes a time when you can't say no." As well as his impressive World Cup showings, Gakpo has also contributed nine goals and 12 assists in 14 Eredivisie appearances so far this season.
