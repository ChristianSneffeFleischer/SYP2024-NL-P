Tottenham winger Steven Bergwijn has admitted his frustration towards his lack of minutes under Antonio Conte. Despite initial optimism that Bergwijn could blossom into a star under Conte, the Dutchman has found minutes incredibly hard to come by and fell further down the pecking order following the January arrival of Dejan Kulusevski, who is already a fan favourite. Bergwijn, whose last three Premier League appearances lasted a combined five minutes, netted three goals in two games for the Netherlands during the current international break, and he admitted that he hopes his form with his country could help his club standing. "I don't get to play much at my club," he said. "I am happy that the national coach has called me up, that's not an obvious thing to do.    You don   t forget how to play football. But of course, you feel that you don   t play that much. It was nice to be here again. We have a good and fun group.    I wouldn   t know [whether form for the Netherlands will help], we   ll see. Everyone wants to play of course. I have to keep my head up and work hard in training. Then we   ll see what happens in the summer.
