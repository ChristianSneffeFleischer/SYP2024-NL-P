Inter 'don't intend to consider' Manchester City's huge asking price for right back Joao Cancelo this summer and have seemingly abandoned any potential deal. There was talk of the Portugal international being part of an audacious three-way swap deal between City, Inter and Barcelona. The Catalans are desperate to sign striker Lautaro Martinez, and it was believed that the clubs had proposed a deal that would see Bar  a swap Nelson Semedo and Cancelo in a deal and then include the Portuguese right-back in their move for the Argentine.  Simple, eh?  Nevertheless, Corriere dello Sport (via Sport Witness) understand any deal involving Cancelo is off the cards, with negotiations between the clubs stalling. City are unwilling to sell the 26-year-old for anything less than    50m this summer after splurging over    67m to secure his services from Juventus last August. It's an asking price the Nerazzurri    don   t intend to consider    despite being keen on bringing Cancelo back to San Siro.  Regardless of what happens with Cancelo, City are apparently keen to shake up their full back options with Alex Telles emerging as one target. The Brazilian had reportedly been of some interest to Chelsea in their search of superior options at that position, but their attentions have turned to Leicester's Ben Chilwell.  Telles' contract at Porto expires in 2021 and with the player unlikely to sign a new deal, the club are under pressure to sell the 27-year-old this summer.  Despite Paris Saint-Germain being hopeful of wrapping up a deal for Telles, French news outlet Le10 Sport believe Pep Guardiola is ready to 'fight' the Parisiens for his signature.
