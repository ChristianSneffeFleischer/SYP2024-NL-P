Vitor Roque's agent has insisted that Barcelona have signed a better player in his client than Real Madrid have by acquiring fellow Brazilian prodigy Endrick.  Barcelona finally announced the signing of Roque for a reported    40m last week, confirming the capture of the highly-rated youngster, with the player set to join the club for the 2024/25 season and remain under contract until the end of the 2030/31 season.  Endrick's move to Real Madrid was confirmed back in December 2022, with the talented young forward also set to arrive in La Liga in 2024 after Los Blancos agreed to pay    35m to Palmeiras for his services.  With both youngsters set to join El Clasico rivals in the same year, there's been much discussion around who will have a bigger impact at their respective new clubs. Speaking to SPORT, Vitor Roque's agent expressed his confidence that his client is better than Endrick, saying:     If you ask me who has made a better hiring Barca or Madrid, it   s very clear. I have already said it in other interviews and I reiterate it again. In my opinion, Vitor is better than Endrick.    Always in my life I try to be impartial, but I see Vitor Roque playing wearing the number nine for Brazil, for everything he does in every game with Athletico.    feed The agent also insisted that Roque was calm about his future transfer to Barcelona, saying:    Vitor is very calm, he will not have any anxiety. He is already doing Catalan classes, he wants to arrive speaking Catalan and Spanish. Everything will work out.    When his signing was closed he was elated, but he is already focused on Athletico Paranaense. He will know how to wait for the right moment to become the main man at Barca and make history.
