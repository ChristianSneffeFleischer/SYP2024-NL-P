Paris Saint-Germain have turned down the chance to sign out-of-favour Arsenal midfielder Matteo Guendouzi this summer.  The Frenchman enjoyed a promising spell under former boss Unai Emery, but has clashed with Mikel Arteta on several occasions since the Spaniard's arrival at the Emirates Stadium last December.  Guendouzi hasn't been a part of an Arsenal matchday squad since his antics in the Gunners' 2-1 defeat at Brighton in their second Premier League game after the restart, and it's understood Arteta is keen to ship the midfielder off this summer. However, the 21-year-old won't be departing for the French capital, with the Telegraph reporting that PSG have no interest in him after his availability was discussed during Les Parisiens' negotiations for full-back Hector Bellerin. Last season's Champions League finalists have sent an initial bid worth  £25m plus  £5m in add-ons Arsenal's way, with Bayern Munich and Juventus also interested in the Spaniard. But while Guendouzi is firmly on Arteta's chopping block, Bellerin is a player who he would like to keep as part of his rebuild at the Emirates. It's been reported, though, that the Gunners won't stand in the way of the 25-year-old's exit if they receive an acceptable offer - the club value Bellerin at  £35m. Nevertheless, Arteta is completely aware that players will have to be sold to fund deals for priority targets this summer, and the departures of Bellerin and Guendouzi - with Valencia tipped as a potential destination - could rack up at around  £55m in fees.
