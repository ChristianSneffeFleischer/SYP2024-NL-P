An emotional Ainsley Maitland-Niles has taken to Instagram to voice his disappointment towards a potential move to Everton being blocked. The Toffees lodged a bid to sign Maitland-Niles, who has managed just 48 minutes so far this year, on a season-long loan with an option to buy but were put on hold by Arsenal, who were evaluating the situation and deciding whether they wanted to lose the 24-year-old permanently. ?

"All I wanna do is go where I'm wanted and where I'm gonna play," Maitland-Niles wrote on Instagram, accompanied by three crying faces. He has never shied away from voicing his frustration towards his treatment at Arsenal. Last year, after he joined West Brom on a six-month loan, Maitland-Niles claimed he was 'rotting away' at the Emirates, where he started just five games in the first half of the season. Maitland-Niles, who tagged Arsenal in his message, is believed to be seeking one-on-one talks with manager Mikel Arteta to get to the bottom of the situation.
