Harry Maguire's proposed transfer to West Ham United has collapsed, 90min understands. After telling Maguire he is free to leave Old Trafford this summer, Manchester United initially rejected a  Â£30m bid from West Ham amid concerns over their ability to satisfy the centre-back's wage demands, only to eventually agree to the offer on the table. West Ham have since completed the signings of Edson Alvarez and James Ward-Prowse but talks over Maguire continued to drag on as they sought to thrash out a wage agreement with both the defender and United. 90min understands that Maguire had agreed the terms of a reduced contract with West Ham but sought a pay-off from United to compensate him for the loss in salary over the remaining two years of his deal at Old Trafford. Sources have now confirmed that no agreement was reached between Maguire and United, forcing West Ham to accept defeat in their pursuit of the centre-back. feed United had been preparing for Maguire's exit by speaking with Bayern Munich over French defender Benjamin Pavard but, as 90min revealed earlier this summer, the Red Devils fear they do not have the financial room to sign another defender with Maguire's high wages still on the books. There has been tentative interest in Maguire from elsewhere but United are not expecting more bids for the 30-year-old, who appears set to remain at Old Trafford beyond this summer. Manager Erik ten Hag is known to be happy to continue working with Maguire as a backup to Raphael Varane and Lisandro Martinez, but he recently warned the England international that he is in for a fight for minutes if he chooses to stay. Maguire remains under contract at United until 2025, with the club holding the option to extend his deal by a further 12 months.
