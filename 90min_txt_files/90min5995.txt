At least one Barcelona board member would consider selling Lionel Messi as his frustration grows at the Catalan club, with Inter, Juventus and PSG in the strongest financial position to make a move for the magician Barcelona's 8-2 defeat to Bayern Munich was very much the tip of the iceberg in a campaign of chaos at Camp Nou. From board member resignations, public spats between Messi and director of football Eric Abidal, social media controversy and swapping 24-year-old Arthur for 30-year-old Miralem Pjanic, it's fair to say the club have enjoyed happier times. In the aftermath of Barcelona's Bayern Munich humbling, reports in Brazil stated that Messi was 'determined' to leave Spain's second city in the summer. According to ESPN, the bulk of the Barcelona board are relaxed about the current situation regarding their talisman because he still has one year remaining on his contract. However, at least one member of the top brass has hinted that they would be prepared to listen to offers if the price is right in order to lower the wage bill and enable new manager Ronald Koeman to rebuild the side.

"As a coach, you want to have the best player in the world in your team and not the other way around," Koeman said. "He has a contract and from today we will talk and start our work.  I hope Messi stays here for more years."
