The upcoming 2021 summer transfer window is going to be a particularly weird one. Clubs have felt the financial impact of the pandemic, but at the same time, there seems to be more stars on the market than ever before. Stick or twist? Gamble or play it safe? Here are 25 of the biggest names that might be on the move in 2021. Current club: BarcelonaPotential destinations: Manchester City, PSGOh yeah, we're starting with the big (little) boy himself. After throwing all of his toys out of the pram last summer off the back of an 8-2 hammering by Bayern Munich, Messi agreed to honour the final year of his contract.New club president Joan Laporta hopes their all-time record everything will sign a new deal, but don't be so sure. Current club: JuventusPotential destinations: PSG, Real MadridImagine going back three or four years and saying Messi and Ronaldo might be off in the same window. Unfortunately for Juve fans, the club revealed that they intend to keep the36-year-old who broke their wage structure.But Juventus (mainly Andrea Agnelli, who didn't actually say this) have said lots of things before. Don't bank on a crazy year not getting any crazier. A post shared by Kylian Mbappe   (@k.mbappe) Current club: PSGPotential destinations: Real Madrid, Manchester CityFuture Ballon d'Or winner, future GOAT, future blah blah blah. We know who Kylian Mbappe is and what his career might look like.The summer of 2021 might present him with the biggest crossroads in his career so far, however - does he stay and further cement his legacy as possibly PSG's finest ever player, or does he make the move to Real Madrid? Current club: Manchester UnitedPotential destinations: Real Madrid, PSG, JuventusThe discourse surrounding Paul Pogba is now at the same level of discourse Moss from The IT Crowd had surrounding football in general."Did you see that ludicrous display last night?""What was Wenger thinking throwing Walcott on that early?""The problem with Arsenal is they always try to walk it in." If you were Harry Kane, would you...    Stay at Spurs. Become the club's goat.    Move to Real Madrid. One of the world's biggest clubs.    Move to PSG. Guaranteed trophies.    Move to Man City. Challenge for all trophies.?? pic.twitter.com/vZXYtL7Z1d Current club: Tottenham HotspurPotential destinations: Manchester City, Manchester United, Real MadridHarry Kane choosing between Spurs and pretty much any elite club in world football is like when Maggie Simpson had to choose between her own family, dripping wet in a dirty river, and the Flanders', portrayed against a background of sunshine and rainbows.Spurs' didn't win the Carabao Cup but Daniel Levy slapping a price tag of about  Â£12bn on him might keep Kane in north London. Current club: Borussia DortmundPotential destinations: Real Madrid, Manchester City, Manchester United, Barcelona, ChelseaHere he is, the man/machine everybody wants.The sweepstakes for Haaland feel reminiscent of those for LeBron James in 2010, not least because it appears most of Europe have given up on landing Mbappe instead. Current club: Real MadridPotential destinations: Manchester United, Chelsea, PSGBut while Haaland and Mbappe may both end up at Real Madrid (God help us all), it seems as though a few of their stars are searching for a new challenge.One of those is Raphael Varane, who's won pretty much everything this game has to offer at the highest level in a decade-long stay in the Spanish capital. Current club: Real MadridPotential destinations: Manchester United, Chelsea, PSGFrom 'a' Madrid star that could leave to 'the' Madrid star that could leave.Ramos' contract stand-off has been well documented, but we've been here before with him, more often than not using Man Utd to make his current club jealous. It tends to work, to be fair. Current club: JuventusPotential destinations: Chelsea, PSG, BarcelonaHailed by 90min's Jack Gallagher as 'simply the most talented player at Juventus Football Club', it appears the Bianconeri are more willing to listen to offers for Dybala than their other superstar attacker.At least he'll be free to blossom elsewhere, Jack, so, you know, every cloud. You're still thinking about the bad news, aren't you? Current club: Aston VillaPotential destinations: Manchester City, Manchester UnitedJack Grealish is now one of the ten best players in the Premier League, and he plays for Aston Villa. Kane being that good at Spurs is one thing, but ol' Greal boy is taking it to a whole new level.He might desire to be to be Villa what Alan Shearer was to Newcastle, or what Francesco Totti was to Roma. But if he doesn't, then there'll be plenty of huge clubs eyeing him up. Current club: Atletico MadridPotential destinations: PSG, ChelseaYou know what? Maybe Jan Oblak doesn't want to make a million saves every week. Maybe Jan Oblak wants to go somewhere else and play like Nick Pope did against San Marino, laying on his arse and doing a sudoku puzzle to pass the time. Have you ever thought of that? A post shared by Sergio Leonel Agu  ero (@kunaguero) Current club: Manchester CityPotential destinations: Barcelona, Chelsea, IndependienteIt's a real shame that two of City's best, if not the best, players of all time in David Silva and Sergio Aguero will have left the Etihad Stadium with such little fanfare because of the global climate.Aguero is expected to depart once his contract expires in the summer, so at least there may be some fans present to bid him farewell. Unless he does a reverse Frank Lampard and heads to Chelsea next season. In which case he'll be back rather sheepishly. Current club: BarcelonaPotential destinations: PSG, Inter, MilanNot many players can say they were deemed surplus to requirements by their club, loaned out and then beat their parent club 8-2 on their way to winning club football's biggest prize.Anyway, Coutinho might finally depart Camp Nou for good this summer. Current club: Borussia DortmundPotential destinations: Manchester United, ChelseaHaaland's rise to superstardom means Sancho has had to be the Scottie Pippen to the Norwegian's Michael Jordan this season. But the lad's still only 21 and puts up numbers for fun.Whoever lands him this time around will still be getting a top player for the next decade. Current club: Manchester UnitedPotential destinations: PSG, Real Madrid90min recently revealed that while Man Utd won't transfer list De Gea, they would be open to offers as they are keen to promote Dean Henderson to their starting XI without causing too much of a fuss.Would you believe the Spaniard is due a testimonial now? I know, right? Current club: NapoliPotential destinations: Everton, PSGIt feels like the ship has sailed for Koulibaly to get his biiiiig move.He's going to feel a lot like the Evergreen heading down the Suez Canal once he finds out Everton is his most likely destination. Current club: BarcelonaPotential destinations: PSG, Manchester UnitedWhy did Griezmann move to Barcelona again? Why did he leave a club who he had already teased about leaving, a club where everything went through him on the pitch, just to get shoehorned into a really dodgy Barcelona side?In all fairness, things have started to click more recently and Griezmann is finally banging in the goals, but you never know. Current club: ChelseaPotential destinations: Manchester United, Liverpool, Bayern MunichAfter such a promising debut season in west London where he over-performed, Pulisic has unfortunately follow it with a drab season where he's underperformed.Liverpool and Man Utd are said to be circling just in case Chelsea decide they've had enough of their still relatively new toy. Current club: Bayern MunichPotential destinations: Chelsea, Manchester UnitedFrom the fringes of the Bayern squad to scoring the winner in the Champions League final, Coman has finally emerged as a top winger.But unfortunately for him, his name isn't Serge Gnabry or Leroy Sane, so he won't ever be the winger for Bayern. Current club: Tottenham HotspurPotential destination: PSGMauricio Pochettino once described Hugo Lloris as an unofficial member of his coaching team during his time at Tottenham.It'd only be natural for him to pay a handsome transfer fee to bring him home to France. A post shared by Aaron Ramsey (@aaronramsey) Current club: JuventusPotential destinations: Arsenal, Liverpool, West Ham, Crystal PalaceRamsey in Italy was fun in theory, until you remembered the poor guy is made of glass and breaks every chance he gets. At least he got to follow in John Charles and Ian Rush's footsteps, eh? Current club: BarcelonaPotential destinations: Chelsea, Roma, PSGDid anyone else forget that Pjanic was essentially swapped for Arthur last summer? There's still a good player there, just needs a bit more TLC (tender loving care or tables, ladders and chairs, whichever works). Current club: Real MadridPotential destinations: Arsenal, EvertonSomeone slightly less memorable than Pjanic is Isco, who has completely fallen off the grid this season.Real's injury woes might have seen his involvement increase a little in recent months, but long term the only way is out. Fancy a reunion with James Rodriguez at Everton, buddy?
