Brighton have completed the signing of left-back Pervis Estupinan from Villarreal in a deal worth a reported  Â£15m. The Ecuador international replaces Marc Cucurella. Estupinan, who has penned a five-year deal to 2017, was part of the Villarreal side that won the Europa League in 2021 and went on to reach the Champions League semi-finals last season.    I am prepared. I had a good season at my club before and I am ready for whatever the head coach says,    the 24-year-old told Brighton   s official website.    I wanted to come and play in what I believe is the best league in the world so much and above all at Brighton. They have showed an incredible amount of interest in me, not just now but for quite a few years. I   m so happy to be here.    Estupinan is already Brighton   s third Ecuadorian player alongside Moises Caicedo and Jeremy Sarmiento, which he believes will help him settle at the Amex Stadium.    To be playing for an English team but to have two Ecuadorian teammates   it will help me a lot. I played with them for Ecuador so I know how they play. This will help me to feel good out on the pitch on a daily basis,    Estupinan said.    They have both already sent me a message saying that they are here for me for whatever I need. I think that it   s really important to have compatriots here. When they invite me to eat spectacular [Ecuadorian] food with them I   ll make sure I   m around!
