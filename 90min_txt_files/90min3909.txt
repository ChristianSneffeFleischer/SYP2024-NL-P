Manchester United starlet Amad Diallo is set to leave the club this summer, joining Dutch outfit Feyenoord on a season-long loan.  The 19-year-old has seen his path to the Red Devils' first team blocked by the arrival of Jadon Sancho, as well as the current plethora of wide forwards available to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.  Diallo will have to go out on loan to earn the minutes he craves, and Fabrizio Romano reports that the winger is now close to completing a season-long move to Eredivisie giants Feyenoord.  Solskjaer himself has confirmed that the former Atalanta star is leaving Old Trafford this summer, hinting that Man Utd had in fact already agreed a deal in principle with another club. "Yes I do [expect him to go out on loan]. It   s not 100% signed but we   ve agreed,    Solskjaer said.    I don   t have to say which team it is yet, but we   ve found a place that Amad feels excited about and we feel excited about.    The deal with Feyenoord is now in the final stages, and it will see Diallo handed the chance to show what he can do at a senior level in the Netherlands. The Ivorian signed for Man Utd in January 2021, and great expectations were immediately placed on the starlet's shoulders.
