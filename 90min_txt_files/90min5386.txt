Roma's CEO Guido Fienga has claimed that Manchester United wanted to keep Chris Smalling, who finally joined I Giallorossi earlier this month on a permanent basis. Smalling enjoyed a fruitful 2019/2020 season on loan at the Serie A club, making 37 appearances and scoring three goals.  Roma were keen to sign the 30-year-old on a permanent basis and pursued the former Fulham man throughout the summer. However, the deal nearly didn't happen - with an agreement finally being reached with United on transfer deadline day.  That came after Roma had secured the loan signing of Real Madrid forward Borja Mayoral, but Fienga - speaking at a press conference which marked both players' arrival - indicated his belief that United would have preferred to keep Smalling at Old Trafford. "Today I am particularly proud to be able to present together both Chris Smalling and Borja Mayoral," he told reporters (via Football Italia).  "They are two players coming from two of the best clubs in the world, but they chose Roma. You know the details of Smalling   s transfer and this is proof that both parties strongly wanted to make it happen. "We have a nice feeling also with Mayoral, he had other important alternatives, including staying at Real Madrid that wanted to keep him. It   s fair to say that Smalling was a cornerstone of Manchester United that wanted to keep hold of him.
