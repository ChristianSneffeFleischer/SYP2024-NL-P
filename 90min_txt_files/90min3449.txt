The 2022/23 season stands to be a particularly unique one for English and European football. The 2022 World Cup will disrupt the campaign in the Premier League and elsewhere as a result of being scheduled in winter, with club competitions put on hold. The 2022 summer transfer window will be an important one for Premier League clubs as always in planning for the new season. A good period of recruitment will be vital for all teams in terms of realising their ambitions, while poor strategy and a lack of buys could be disastrous. Here is everything you need to know about when the transfer window opens for Premier League clubs, when it closes, what time the deadline is, when the 2022/23 season itself begins and how the calendar will be affected by the World Cup... The Premier League has confirmed that the summer transfer window will be open from as early as 10 June, less than three weeks after the final day of the 2021/22 season on 22 May - and only 13 days after the Champions League final. The international transfer window for Premier League clubs, according to FIFA's registration period calendar, will begin as normal on 1 July 2022 - one day after the official end of 2021/22 on 30 June. Premier League clubs voted to repeal a brief and short-sighted early closing of the summer transfer window in 2020, having shot themselves in the foot for the previous two seasons. Normality has been restored ever since and 2022 will be no different, with the transfer deadline falling on 1 September in line with other European leagues. The deadline itself will be 11pm (BST). The 2022/23 Premier League season will begin on the weekend of 6/7 August, brought slightly forward from the usual mid-August start date to create extra space in the calendar for the World Cup, which is being played in November and December to avoid the summer heat of Qatar. The season will finish on Sunday 28 May 2023, slightly later than usual for the same reasons. As is the case with other top flight European leagues, the 2022/23 Premier League season will be paused for the duration of the winter World Cup in Qatar. Premier League players called up for the World Cup will have only a short break between the final round of domestic fixtures and the start of the tournament. The last club games will be played on the weekend of 12/13 November, with players reporting for duty with their respective national teams from 14 November and the World Cup itself commencing on 21 November.
