The teams across Europe tracking the progress of Sevilla centre-back Jules Kounde have been handed a timely boost, with a new report alleging the La Liga side have reduced their summer asking price to around  £50m. The 22-year-old has become one of the most sought after defenders on the continent after a string of impressive displays, and he's previously been linked with the likes of Manchester United and Real Madrid. Sevilla had initially slapped an asking price of around  £70m plus add-ons on Kounde, but it appears they may have had a change of heart. The Sun report that Los Nervionenses are now prepared to accept around  £20m less than figure, which could be music to the ears of interested parties. Manchester United are known to be in the market for a long-term partner for club captain Harry Maguire, and after rivals Manchester City missed out on a deal for Kounde last summer, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and the club's hierarchy may be ready to pounce. It is understood that Kounde has an  £87.4m release clause written into  £70,000 per week contract, but United are willing to more than double his base salary, while they are also prepared to includelucrative bonuses and future incentives. Question marks remain over Victor Lindelof's ability at the highest level, while teammate Eric Bailly, who has impressed when available, has been a regular visitor to United's treatment table - severely hampering his amount of on-field minutes. The 26-year-old is also thought to be annoyed by his sudden drop down the pecking order, and it's rumoured that he could seek an Old Trafford exit in order to nail down a starting position elsewhere.
