Contract talks between Bayern Munich and Kingsley Coman have broken down and the winger could now be sold in the transfer window. The Frenchman has been holding discussions with the Bundesliga champions over an contract, with the 24-year-old's current deal due to expire in the summer of 2023. However, according to BILD, the latest round of talks ended several weeks ago and the involved parties are no closer to reaching an agreement. Marco Neppe, Bayern's technical director, is leading the negotiations on behalf of the club and is said to be frustrated by Coman's financial demands.  As per the report, the former Juventus winger is currently earning a reported    12m ( £10.3m) per season and while the current offer would see him given an increase up to approximately    13m, it's understood the player's camp are demanding    12m net which would equate to over    20m gross. Coman swapped Italy for Germany back in 2015, initially on loan from Juventus before the deal was made permanent in 2017 for  £18.9m, and his value has increased significantly since the move. The France international has made 200 appearances for Bayern so far, scoring 41 goals and producing 50 assists, and netted the winner in the 2020 Champions League final.
