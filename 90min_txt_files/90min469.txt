Bayern Munich have paid the full release clause for Napoli centre-back Kim Min-jae and expect to complete the signing by Monday, 90min understands. Manchester United held talks with Kim over a possible transfer last month, but Bayern have beaten them to the highly-rated South Korea international. Kim quickly emerged as one of Europe   s best central defenders during his sole season with Napoli following an    18m transfer from Fenerbahce last summer. Having joined the Turkish giants from Beijing Guoan in China for just    3m in 2021, his rise to prominence has been rapid. feed A    50m release clause in Kim   s Napoli contract active from 1 July has been much talked about. Having been unsuccessful in offering the 26-year-old a fresh deal that would have meant a substantial pay rise while removing the clause, 90min understands the reigning Serie A champions were then never willing to negotiate a transfer fee with potential suitors and that paying the full amount specified in the contract was the only way to sign him. At one stage it is believed the preference of the player   s camp was to join United, who are looking to move on Harry Maguire. Newcastle and Paris Saint-Germain were also in touch. But Bayern surged ahead and sources close to Napoli have now confirmed the full release clause has been received. Kim is set to complete the final part of his medical with the German giants and will become the latest Korean to join Bayern after Jeong Woo-yeong and Lee Hyun-ju in recent years.
