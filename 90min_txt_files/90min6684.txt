Arsenal are ready to take a loss on left-back Kieran Tierney less than 12 months after his eagerly anticipated  £25m arrival from Celtic, which will open the door for Leicester to sign the Scotland international and reunite him with ex-Hoops boss Brendan Rodgers. Tierney has seen his time at Arsenal ravaged by two major injuries and he has struggled to settle at the club. He was carrying a hip problem when he first arrived that delayed his debut until late September, and around ten weeks later he suffered a dislocated shoulder. The shoulder problem in December required surgery and Tierney hadn   t returned by the time football was halted by the onset of the coronavirus crisis. Arsenal have also undergone a change in manager since his arrival last summer. With only four Premier League starts to his name, 90min has learned that Tierney   s representatives have been informed the Gunners are prepared to sanction a deal. 90min previously revealed in February that Leicester are targeting the four-time PFA Scotland Young Player of the Year, who was a key player in Rodgers    dominant Celtic side. At that time, 90min understood that the Foxes were prepared to offer Arsenal their money back on Tierney, which would have entailed a  £25m offer. However, things have changed, and with Arsenal willing to accept a loss, Leicester now believe a deal can be done for around  £18m instead. Leicester are expected to sell current starting left-back Ben Chilwell this summer, with both Chelsea and Manchester City already engaged in talks for the England international. But it was already Leicester   s intention to make an approach for Tierney regardless of Chilwell   s future.
