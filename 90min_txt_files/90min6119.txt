Lionel Messi will remain at Barcelona for the rest of his career, according to club president Josep Maria Bartomeu.  Messi's current Bar  a deal expires in June 2021 and he has been linked with a romantic return to former side Newell's Old Boys recently. A number of other destinations have also been mention, though none of these rumours have ever been substantiated.  Despite this speculation, Bartomeu revealed he was confident Messi would continue to ply his trade at Camp Nou for next several seasons. "It's not just me who says it. Messi says it himself, that he wants to finish his professional playing career at Barcelona and it's the only club for him," Bartomeu told beIN SPORTS (via AS).  "I don't have any doubt that when he finishes his football career in three or four years that it will be here in Barcelona. "Messi has it very clear. He's been here since he was a kid. He knows the colours and he's a part of the club's history. He's the best player in the world. Not just right now, but in the history of the game.  He's at Barcelona and has made clear he wants to stay here." ? "I don't consider myself the greatest player in Bar  a's history because it's Ronaldinho. He wasn't simply passing the ball, he was passing the torch to me."Lionel Messi's first goal for Barcelona was special for a number of reasons! ?pic.twitter.com/CX3uvsjedW
