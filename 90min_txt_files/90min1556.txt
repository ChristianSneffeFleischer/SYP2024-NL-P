Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti has urged the club to agree a new contract with Karim Benzema, as well as insisting the veteran French striker will not going anywhere in the summer. Benzema is second on Real   s list of all-time goalscorers behind only Cristiano Ronaldo and ahead of Raul and Alfredo Di Stefano. The 35-year-old has netted 202 times for Real in the last four and a half years alone and was also appointed club captain following Marcelo   s departure in the summer. This season has been a little tougher because of injury, but Benzema has still usually scored when fit. But he is out of contract this coming summer and Ancelotti is adamant his star forward needs to stay.
