Scott McTominay has been the subject of interest from a number of Premier League clubs after it emerged Real Madrid's Casemiro was to join Manchester United, 90min has learned. United have moved this week for the 30-year-old Brazilian, confirming an agreement to sign him on Friday night. He will to undergo a medical at Carrington after the two clubs agreed a fee. Casemiro will become a bonafide starter in Erik ten Hag's United lineup and United are also looking at options to sign a second midfielder before the transfer window closes. McTominay would be the player most likely to suffer in playing time, with Fred having already struck up an effective relationship with Casemiro at international level. United have been inundated with interest in the Scottish international in the hours since the move became clear, though the club have not made McTominay available at this point. The 25-year-old has not asked to leave either. Any departure for McTominay, were it to happen before the end of the window, would most likely be on loan. United have made another midfield academy graduate in James Garner available for sale but he is untried at Premier League level. Newcastle United, who have recently lost Jonjo Shelvey to injury, are long-term admirers of McTominay and are keeping tabs on his situation, while West Ham's David Moyes is another confirmed fan of the player. Everton, Southampton and Leicester are also understood to be keen, along with clubs in both Italy and Germany.
