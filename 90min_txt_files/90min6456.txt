Tottenham Hotspur are highly interested in signing Lazio star Sergej Milinkovi  -Savi   this summer, and could make a deal work financially through multiple sales, according to a report from France. The Serbian international has continued to impress for I Biancocelesti, and has been crucial to their title challenge this season. An imposing player physically, he's also talented with the ball, racking up five goals and four assists in the league this season. According to French outlet Foot Mercato, Spurs are the latest side to be considering a move for the 25-year-old, who is said to be of 'great interest' to the club, with manager Jos   Mourinho a huge admirer. The Portuguese boss is said to have noticed a lack of 'density and size' (presumably an inexact translation, but also a fun thought) among his midfield options, and has 'concretely' advocated for signing Milinkovi  -Savi   - a move which his technical staff are said to agree with.  It's understood that the north London team will have the 'sufficient' funds to make a potential deal happen, as club officials are claimed to be anticipating sales to be made in the summer.  One name who has been linked with a departure is Tanguy Ndombele after an apparent falling out with Mourinho and, despite a recent report stating the club has no intention to sell their record signing, they could be open to his departure if it was necessary to land the Lazio star.
