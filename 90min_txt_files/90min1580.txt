Barcelona president Joan Laporta has admitted the club are planning to offload another    70m in wages in the summer transfer window. The Blaugrana's financial struggled are well-documented, with their high wages seeing them fall foul of La Liga's salary cap rules on a number of occasions in the past. They were blocked from making any permanent signings during the January transfer window and face a battle to free up enough money to put their ambitious plans into action once the end of the season arrives. "It is difficult for us to register players due to the salary limit and the regulations," Laporta admitted. "La Liga sets limits based on clubs' accounts, and in the case of Barcelona, we inherited a limit exceeded by millions and millions. "There are contracts that were increased, it was exceeded by between    300m and    350m. A titanic effort has been made. As of today, we have reduced it by    100m and we hope to reach    175m in the summer, while also keeping a competitive team. The levers helped that. "As we continue with a salary that exceeds the limit, it costs the club and La Liga sets more restrictive regulations. With these regulations and the levers, we have registered players with a titanic effort, but La Liga has been changing the regulations so that we cannot do these operations. Every time we overcome an obstacle, La Liga changes the norm for us."
