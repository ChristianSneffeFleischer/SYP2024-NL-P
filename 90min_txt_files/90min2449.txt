Barcelona midfielder Sergio Busquets has played down reports linking him with a move to MLS, insisting he is yet to make a decision on his future. The veteran's contract at Camp Nou expires at the end of the season and he has been touted with a move to the United States, with Inter Miami consistently linked with a move for the 34-year-old. Busquets remains an integral part of Bar  a's side, but reports in Spain have suggested that head coach Xavi will attempt to integrate Frenkie de Jong at the heart of the midfield over the next year. A contract extension from Barcelona looks unlikely to come, but Busquets is adamant that he is yet to make a definitive decision on his next move regardless.

"There is nothing despite the rumours that have appeared. There is nothing official. I   ll see how I   m doing this season. There is nothing. "I want to enjoy myself and then I will see. It is clear that I am not 20 years old. A priori, it is the last year of my contract, but things have been made official that are false." While De Jong is likely to take over his role as Barcelona's number six, Busquets hailed Real Sociedad's Martin Zubimendi as a potential replacement in the national team squad.
