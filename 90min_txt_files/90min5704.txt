Tottenham's search for new attackers has taken them to the Bundesliga, with Bayer Leverkusen's Leon Bailey and Eintracht Frankfurt's Bas Dost on Jos   Mourinho's shortlist. Mourinho has spoken publicly about his desire to bring in some attacking reinforcements this summer, with the boss concerned by the lack of depth in his squad. Spurs have no senior striker other than Harry Kane, while the only forwards on the bench for the 1-0 loss to Everton were Steven Bergwijn and   rik Lamela. A whole host of names have been linked with moves to the club, with Crystal Palace loanee Alexander S  rloth and Torino's Andrea Belotti two of many, and now there are a few more players to add to the list. Beginning with Leverkusen's Bailey, Sky Sports News claim Spurs have followed the Jamaica international closely in recent months and are interested in a deal, although not for the  £40m the German side are looking for. Bailey, who is also wanted by Everton, is said to be keen to make the move to the Premier League this summer, but whether Leverkusen will let him go for less than  £40m is unclear. One cheaper alternative would be Dost. The Daily Mail claim the 31-year-old Dutchman is available for just  £5.5m, which could well move him towards the top of Spurs' wish list. Dost bagged ten goals in all competitions last season, down from the 23 he managed in 2018/19, and he kicked off this year with a goal and an assist in his side's 2-1 win over 1860 Munich. Mourinho's pursuit of at least one new forward is expected to be accelerated after Sunday's 1-0 loss to Everton, after which the boss described his team as 'lazy' and hit out at their poor mentality and preparation.
