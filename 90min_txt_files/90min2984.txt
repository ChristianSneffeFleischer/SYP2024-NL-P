Chelsea have reached out to RB Leipzig to enquire about a deal for defender Nordi Mukiele, who has already agreed the terms of a transfer to Paris Saint-Germain. The Ligue 1 champions initially pursued Mukiele on a loan deal but eventually gave into Leipzig's demands of a permanent transfer, striking an agreement over a    16m fee and thrashing out personal terms with the Frenchman with little issue. PSG are now hopeful of finalising the signing of Mukiele in the coming days but sources have confirmed to 90min that they may have to fend off a late challenge from Chelsea, who have got in touch with Leipzig to pursue a deal of their own. The Blues, alongside Manchester United, have been following Mukiele over the last year and Todd Boehly's side have now made contact with Leipzig to try and beat PSG to a deal. While PSG already have the terms of a bargain deal agreed - Mukiele has just 12 months remaining on his contract - what Chelsea do have in their favour is the presence of former Leipzig striker Timo Werner, who is looking to leave Stamford Bridge this summer. Leipzig are one of the sides to have reached out to Chelsea about a deal for the German, and sources indicate that the idea of sending Werner back to Red Bull Arena as part of a move for Mukiele has been discussed. Werner has gone public with his desire to play more at club level in the build-up to the Qatar World Cup later this year - comments which prompted confusion from manager Thomas Tuchel, whose desire to improve his squad has been made abundantly clear.
