Burnley have registered their interest in signing 20-year-old Amad Diallo on loan ahead of the 2023/24 season, 90min understands.  The Ivory Coast starlet was signed by Manchester United in January 2021, but has played just nine games in all competitions to date due to various loan spells. While his first loan spell at Rangers during the second half of the 2021/22 season proved to be largely unsuccessful, Diallo really found his feet during a second at Sunderland last season.  In his single season at the Stadium of Light the youngster was one of the most impressive performers in the Championship, scoring 13 goals for Sunderland as they mounted an unlikely promotion bid - a bid that would end at the hands of Luton Town in the play-offs.  For his efforts, Adam won the Sunderland Young Player of the Year award and earned the PFA Championship Player of the Month award in December too.  feed Now back at Man Utd following the spell at Sunderland, 90min understands that a number of Premier League clubs are keen to sign the youngster on a season-long loan deal ahead of the 2023/24 campaign. One such club are Burnley, who recently booked their place back in the top flight after winning the Championship league title last season in impressive fashion - finishing the campaign with over 100 points.  Everton, West Ham United and Fulham have all registered their interest too, as have Sunderland - although the Black Cats' failure to gain promotion to the Premier League has made a move back to the club unlikely.  Sources have confirmed to 90min that the interested clubs will likely have to wait until after pre-season before knowing whether or not Diallo is going out on loan again. Man Utd manager Erik ten Hag is keen to assess the player in pre-season before making a decision on his short-term future.
