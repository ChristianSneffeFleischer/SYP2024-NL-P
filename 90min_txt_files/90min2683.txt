Wolves have held talks with Stuttgart over a deal to sign towering striker Sasa Kalajdzic, 90min understands. The 6'7 striker bagged 16 goals in 33 games in the 2020/21 season before injury restricted him to six strikes in 15 outings last year, and Kalajdzic has started off the current campaign with three assists in as many outings. Kalajdzic, 25, has entered the final year of his contract and has attracted interest from around the globe, with the likes of Manchester United and Newcastle among the Premier League sides chasing the Austrian. Wolves have now joined the race, however, and sources have confirmed to 90min that negotiations are on between the two clubs over a possible transfer. Stuttgart are holding out for a fee of around  £22m but Wolves are hoping to strike a deal at somewhere closer to the  £15m mark. Goals continue to be a problem for Bruno Lage's side, whose opening-day strike against Leeds is still their only goal to date, and the boss has been exploring different lineups to try and get his team firing again. Summer signing Goncalo Guedes started up top alongside Daniel Podence in Wolves' unfortunate 1-0 defeat to Tottenham, in which Lage's side managed more shots but were again made to pay for their lack of cutting edge in front of goal. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  &  Toby Cudworth  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Erik ten Hag wanting to sign five players before the transfer window closes, and Man Utd's attitude to selling Cristiano Ronaldo.
