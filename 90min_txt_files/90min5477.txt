Bayern Munich have confirmed the signing of Brazilian winger Douglas Costa from Juventus on a season-long loan. Costa initially joined Juventus on loan from Bayern in 2017, and the move was made permanent the following summer after he impressed in his first year in Serie A. He has won three league titles in Turin, but injuries have caused him to fall out of favour, and he is yet to start under Andrea Pirlo. Bayern confirmed on deadline day that he has returned to Germany,  where he scored 14 goals in 77 appearances previously.
