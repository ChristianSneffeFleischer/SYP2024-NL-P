Brentford are hopeful that David Raya will commit his long-term future to the club, 90min understands. 90min were first to report in November that Raya was on Tottenham's list of targets to succeed Hugo Lloris, whose form has dipped this season - no player has committed more errors leading to goals in the Premier League this term. The Spain international, whose contract expires in 2024, is also admired by Atletico Madrid, Chelsea and Manchester United, while there have been suggestions in the English press that Spurs could bring forward their succession plan for Lloris with a bid for Raya this month. But sources have told 90min that Brentford hope Raya will stay beyond this summer and want to agree terms over a new contract after roughly a year of negotiations. Raya's performances following Brentford's promotion have not gone unnoticed, emerging as one of the Premier League's finest goalkeepers both between the sticks and with the ball at his feet. He has made the most saves in the top flight this year (86), with the Bees rising up the table and fighting back against any notions of 'second season syndrome'. Raya was named to Spain's 26-player squad for this winter's World Cup in Qatar, though did not make an appearance and remains a relative unknown in his home country having joined Blackburn Rovers as a teenager.
