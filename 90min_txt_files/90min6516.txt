Frank Lampard has denied that Chelsea have submitted a bid for Bayer Leverkusen star Kai Havertz.  Chelsea have already secured deals for Hakim Ziyech and Timo Werner and there have been reports linking Havertz with a move to west London.  The 21-year-old is one of the most in demand players in Europe with Manchester United, Bayern Munich, Liverpool and Real Madrid just some of the other names that have been mentioned as potential destinations.  The Blues are also in the hunt for his signature but Lampard was quick to dismiss the rumours when quizzed prior to his side's game against Manchester City on Thursday. "He   s obviously a top player but we   re not going to comment on other players at other teams,    the Chelsea boss insisted (via the Independent). When pushed on the issue of whether any bids had gone in for the midfielder, Lampard replied: "no bids have gone in," though he did let out a suspicious smirk in the process.   Havertz has been in inspired form for  in recent times, racking up 12 goals and six Bundesliga assists for Peter Bosz's side this season. Leverkusen are increasingly resigned to losing their prize asset and it is understood that the player would favour a move to Real.  One possible scenario could be Havertz remaining in Germany for an additional season while Los Blancos raise funds to finance a deal that could cost close to  Â£90m.  During his socially distanced press conference Lampard also addressed the new contracts of Willian and Pedro who have both extended their stays at Stamford Bridge until the end of the season.  "I am pleased and the negotiations were relatively easy,    he said. It   s a good think Frank Lampard doesn   t play poker, he barely could keep a straight face when asked if any bids for Kai Havertz been made by Chelsea.  pic.twitter.com/WSygSBuKG4
