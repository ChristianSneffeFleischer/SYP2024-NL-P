Udinese midfielder Rodrigo De Paul has confirmed his desire to join Leeds United this summer in response to another social media post, but quickly removed the update.  De Paul has been identified as the ideal target by Marcelo Bielsa as he looks to strengthen in midfield this summer, with the Argentine's eye for goal a particularly impressive attribute of his. The 26-year-old made 34 appearances in Serie A last season, grabbing seven goals and six assists.  Leeds are said to be pushing hard to sign De Paul, but the two clubs appear to still be some way apart with regards to the fee. Udinese are standing firm over their valuation and are looking for as much as    40m for his services, as he still has four years to run on his current contract.  While there is no agreement yet, De Paul made his positions regarding the move to Elland Road very clear on Monday. Leeds fanzine The Square Ball provided an update on the potential deal on their Twitter, stating that De Paul is indeed keen on the move, and it was simply now a matter of the two clubs trying to reach an agreement.  Responding to this (as captured by The Square Ball), the Udinese man very simply yet effectively replied 'Yes' with a fingers crossed emoji. De Paul quickly removed his tweet, before seemingly deleting his account not long after.  ? #LUFC pic.twitter.com/nEvj0Z7bEL
