Tottenham and Brighton are both looking to sign Udinese left-back Destiny Udogie, 90min understands. Udogie emerged as one of the best young defenders in Serie A last season during his loan from Hellas Verona to Udinese, which was made permanent earlier this summer as the latter's obligation to buy for    4m was triggered. There has been interest in the 19-year-old from Serie A, where Juventus and Inter have asked to be kept informed, but sources have confirmed to 90min that the interest from England could push the prospective deal beyond their valuation of the player. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  &  Sean Walsh  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Chelsea's plans to sign Marc Cucurella and Wesley Fofana. There's the latest on James Maddison, Jamie Vardy, Cristiano Ronaldo and Frenkie de Jong, and chat on Diogo Jota's new deal and Roberto Firmino's Liverpool future.
