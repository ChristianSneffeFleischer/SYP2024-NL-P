Barcelona sporting advisor Jordi Cruyff has hinted that the club's transfer activity may again be hindered by La Liga's financial regulations.  Last summer Bar  a were forced to part with prized asset Lionel Messi as economic problems would have prevented him being re-registered at the Camp Nou.  Although the club are now on a more even keel financially, they still have a significant amount of debt and after their final game of the season - a 2-0 defeat to Villarreal - Cruyff admitted that the club may be prevented from doing all the business they would like to this summer. "We will try to reinforce the squad. There is plan A, plan B, plan C and D, but we will see what we can do because we have to comply with financial fair play," he told Movistar F  tbol. After initially improving when Xavi took over as manager in November, Barcelona ended the campaign with a few bumps.  They crashed out of the Europa League to eventual winners Eintracht Frankfurt at the quarter-final stage and also saw their La Liga form dip - though they did still finish second.  And Cruyff went on to reveal his belief that significant investment in the squad was required ahead of next season.
