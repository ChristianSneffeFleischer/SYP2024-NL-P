Leicester City manager Brendan Rodgers has confirmed the club have rejected two bids from Chelsea for centre-back Wesley Fofana. As previously reported by 90min, Chelsea started the bidding at  £60m but soon raised that proposal to  £70m. However, Leicester continue to play hard-ball and are looking to bring in a fee of over  £80m to part ways with the 21-year-old Frenchman. Chelsea are yet to meet that fee but sources close to the negotiation expect such an offer to arrive imminently, particularly as Fofana is now pushing for a move to Stamford Bridge this summer. Meanwhile, Rodgers has maintained his public stance that Fofana is not for sale.    There have been no new bids this week," the Leicester boss told a press conference. "There were two [bids], but nowhere near what the club would consider. We   re not looking to sell.  "Naturally if there   s interest from other clubs, that is looked at by the club. He   s a top young defender and there are not too many around his age.
