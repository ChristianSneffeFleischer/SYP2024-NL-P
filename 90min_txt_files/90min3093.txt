Alessio Romagnoli turned down offers from Premier League clubs to join SS Lazio as a free agent this summer, 90min understands. The former AC Milan captain became a free agent in June after the expiration of his contract at San Siro - bringing an end to a seven year spell at the club. Romagnoli won his first Serie A title at Milan last season, but was a bit-part player during the 2021/22 season, making 16 league starts. The 27-year-old, who began his career at AS Roma, officially joined Lazio on Tuesday, signing a five-year deal at the Stadio Olimpico. Speaking after the announcement, Romagnoli said: "The first Serie A game I saw was a Lazio game. [Sven-Goran] Eriksson's Lazio. "I always saw Nesta as captain. I also had his poster. He was the strongest of all in my opinion, no one will ever be like him. "I am a Lazio fan, I have never hidden it and I think it is also right to say it because there is no problem."
