Vasco da Gama have confirmed they have struck an agreement to sell midfielder Andrey Santos to Chelsea. 90min confirmed last month that Chelsea were closing in on the signature of the 18-year-old, who was previously on the radars of Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain and Newcastle. Now, Vasco have confirmed the deal is done, bidding farewell to Santos and confirming he is heading to join Chelsea. Santos has shone in the Brazilian Serie B this season and has quickly established himself as one of the most intriguing prospects in the country, with a number of European heavyweights keen to land his signature. Chelsea were not in that initial chasing pack but soon forced themselves to the front of the queue as part of their new strategy to snap up some of the game's top young talents.
