Fulham striker Aleksandar Mitrovic has emerged as the Saudi Pro League's latest high-profile transfer target, while his manager Marco Silva is also the subject of interest, sources have confirmed to 90min. Mitrovic proved many doubters wrong last season upon his return to the Premier League, finishing the campaign with 14 goals in 24 games. The Serbia international is contracted to Fulham until 2026 and just as is the case with Portugal midfielder Joao Palhinha, the west London outfit are not planning on losing their prized assets. 90min understands an opening offer has arrived from Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal, who tabled an initial bid worth  £25m. But sources close to Fulham insist Mitorvic is not for sale and the bid was quickly rebuffed. It remains to be seen if Al Hilal will try again, with sources telling 90min the 28-year-old does want to move to Saudi Arabia where he has been offered a three-year deal worth more than  £20m per season. feed 90min understands that Al Ahli also have an interest in Mitrovic, but Al Hilal are seen as the most likely option given they already have a deal in place to sign his good friend Sergej Milinkovic-Savic. While Fulham are adamant that Mitrovic will not be leaving, they are also continuing to try and persuade manager Marco Silva to reject advances from the Saudi Pro League. Silva has already rebuffed an offer earlier this summer this to move to Saudi Arabia, but 90min can confirm that efforts are still being made to land the Portuguese coach. His current deal expires in 2024 and Fulham are working hard to convince Silva to sign a new deal, but they know they are unable to hand him the kind of money on offer from Saudi Arabia. Al Ahli are believed to be the side eyeing Silva.
