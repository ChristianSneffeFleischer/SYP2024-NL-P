Manchester United have rejected  £30m offers from West Ham for Harry Maguire and Scott McTominay, sources have confirmed to 90min. West Ham saw an opening offer for former captain Maguire worth  £20m rebuffed last month before a more recent second proposal of  £30m was also dismissed by United. The Hammers also firmed up their interest in another United star in the shape of Scottish midfielder McTominay but, like with Maguire, the Red Devils were not willing to do business at the  £30m mark. 90min understands the actual offers were not too far away from United's valuation, but the overall deals including the wages West Ham could afford or were willing to provide were not sufficient enough to tempt the Old Trafford giants into selling either player. United, who themselves have spent more than  £100m this summer on Andre Onana, Mason Mount and Rasmus Hojlund, are anxious to move players on to finance other deals and Erik ten Hag has sanctioned the departures of both Maguire and McTominay.  However, neither player is desperate to move. feed Maguire remains unconvinced that his future is best served away from the club despite having the captaincy stripped, while McTominay also believes he could yet play his way into Ten Hag's plans given fellow midfielders Donny van de Beek and Fred are expected to move this summer.  West Ham - who are the only team to make firm offers for either Maguire or McTominay this summer - are now considering improved bids for the two players. They are also looking to complete the signing of Ajax midfielder Edson Alvarez in the coming days.
