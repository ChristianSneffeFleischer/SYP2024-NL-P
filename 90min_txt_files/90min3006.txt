Declan Rice has confessed seeing his name in the transfer rumour mill can be 'annoying' at times.

Speaking to Sky Sports News, Rice confirmed he will remain at West Ham this season, taking the captain's armband following the retirement of Mark Noble, and admitted he will keep working to drown out the transfer rumours. "I'm going to be captain of West Ham this season. It's an honour," he said. "When I came into the team five years ago, I would have never thought I would be West Ham club captain one day.

On whether he can get frustrated by the speculation, Rice admitted he does not enjoy being the focus of the transfer headlines. "It is annoying because of the numbers that get attached to your name," he said. "Obviously, you can't control that at all.
