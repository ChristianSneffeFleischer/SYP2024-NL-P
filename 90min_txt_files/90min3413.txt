Barcelona manager Xavi has ruled out a move for Frenkie de Jong this summer, insisting the midfielder 'can mark an era' at Camp Nou.  De Jong was linked with a move to Manchester United swiftly after it was announced that Ajax manager Erik ten Hag would be taking over at Old Trafford at the end of the season. The midfielder broke through under Ten Hag, enjoying a wonderful trophy-laden few years at Ajax with the manager before moving to Barcelona for  Â£75m.  Following a slow start to his career at La Blaugrana, De Jong has found his best form again since Xavi took charge at the end of 2021. Since then the 24-year-old has contributed seven goal contributions as Bar  a have flown up the league table.  Speaking (via Mundo Deportivo) ahead of Sunday's clash with Rayo Vallecano, Xavi insisted that De Jong will not be leaving Barcelona. He said: "Frenkie  [de Jong] is very important for me, for the club and for the team. He is a footballer who  has to mark an era with his quality and personality.
