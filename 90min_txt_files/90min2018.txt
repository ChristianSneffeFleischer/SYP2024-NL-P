Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag has admitted it will be    difficult    for the club to sign a striker during the January transfer window due to the inflated costs at this time of year. United are in desperate need of additional firepower, with Cristiano Ronaldo   s sudden departure in November leaving Anthony Martial as the only recognised number nine in the squad. Ten Hag was keen on Cody Gakpo, but Liverpool beat United to a transfer worth up to    50m for the Dutch international. Reports following initial news of the deal suggested that United are limited to loan deals in January, with that hesitation enough to allow Liverpool to jump ahead. Now, United find themselves having to potentially get    creative    in the market.    It is always difficult, strikers are expensive and especially in the winter, you set the limits high so maybe we have to be creative,    Ten Hag explained.    We do everything in our power to get it done and get the right player who fits the balance.    I don   t think you can judge [the chances of making a signing] and rate it. It is about timing, availability, about so many circumstances playing a role.    It is now [late] December     the window has not even started.
