Manchester United have reached a broad agreement with Ajax for the signing of Lisandro Martinez, 90min understands. The Red Devils have previously made two offers for the Argentine, who is capable of playing at centre-back, full-back and in a holding midfield role, and have been keen to wrap up a deal as quickly as possible amid interest from Arsenal. Ajax have been firm in negotiations with United, and have attempted to drive his price up on numerous occasions, but Erik ten Hag's desire to bring him to Old Trafford has seen talks continue. 90min understands that a broad agreement has now been reached between United and Ajax, with the 13-time Premier League winners agreeing to pay a    55m fee for the 24-year-old -    50m in guaranteed payments and    5m in add-ons. Ajax had been hoping to push United closer to    60m, but Martinez has made his desire to move increasingly known over the last 48 hours - perhaps prompting an agreement to be reached. Listen now to 90min's Talking Transfers podcast, with  Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey,  Harry Symeou  &  Toby Cudworth. On the latest show they discuss Chelsea's interest in Antony and Serge Gnabry, why Man Utd have still not signed Frenkie de Jong, Man City's pursuit of Marc Cucurella and more. Available on  all audio platforms  and the  90min YouTube channel.

Ajax want    80m for the 22-year-old and, at this stage, a deal is not close to being agreed.
