Pep Guardiola has ruled out a move away from Manchester City for Bernardo Silva, adding the club had not received contact from Barcelona or Paris Saint-Germain regarding a possible transfer. Barca's admiration of Silva has been very public this summer while PSG have been linked with a move too, though City CEO Ferran Soriano recently insisted that the Portuguese midfielder had not asked to leave the club. And speaking ahead of City's Premier League clash with Crystal Palace at the weekend, Guardiola added that clubs have not been in touch about Silva's future, and with so little time remaining in the summer transfer window, he will be staying put. "He will stay here. Absolutely," Guardiola said. "We don   t have any phone call from any club regarding Bernardo Silva, so he is staying."
