Leicester City boss Brendan Rodgers has spoken about Demarai Gray's future at the club, revealing the winger is unlikely to be playing his football at the King Power Stadium next season. The former England Under-21 international has only made one senior appearance this season, in the Foxes 2-0 home defeat to Arsenal in the Carabao Cup. He hasn't featured at all in the Premier League or Europa League, even off the bench. The 24-year-old's contract expires in the summer, and it now seems highly likely the Foxes will attempt to cash in in January or allow the winger to leave for free at the end of the campaign. Rodgers said (as quoted by the Daily Mail): "It's pretty clear with Demarai he's looking to move on. His attitude to training has been first class, he has been very professional. "He is at the stage of his career where he has been here a long time and hasn't maybe nailed down a place. A fresh start may be the course for him." Gray has been at Leicester since 2016, playing 168 games. His best season came in 2018/2019 when he scored four goals for the Foxes, but since then he has seen his game time drop dramatically, starting only three Premier League games last season. With the Foxes through to the round of 32 in the Europa League as group winners after their 2-0 win against AEK Athens, and sitting comfortably at the top end of the Premier League, it seems Rodgers has finally deemed Gray surplus to requirements.
