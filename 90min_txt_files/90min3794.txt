Matthijs de Ligt is not happy with his current role at Juventus, amid interest from Barcelona and Chelsea.  De Ligt has not pushed on as much as he was expected to since arriving in Turin from Ajax back in 2019. Injuries and spells out of the team due to the form of Leonardo Bonucci and Giorgio Chiellini have led to him missing extended periods for Juve.  According to Calcio Mercato, the Dutchman is not satisfied with his position at the club and the recent arrival of new manager Massimiliano Allegri has done little to quell his unrest.  De Ligt's agent, Mino Raiola, is already sounding out possible destination for his client in the near future. One club in the running are Barcelona, who are eager to replace the long-serving Gerard Pique in their backline.    Bar  a were among the favourites to sign De Ligt back in 2019 but they were eventually outmanoeuvred by Juventus. The player is now understood to regret his decision and could be open to a move to the Camp Nou - where he would be a guaranteed starter. Raiola has also spoken with Chelsea, who could have defensive issues of their own. Uncertainty remains over Antonio Rudiger's contract and Thiago Silva is likely to leave at the end of the season. Andreas Christensen, whose deal also expires in the summer, is close to penning fresh terms, though.
