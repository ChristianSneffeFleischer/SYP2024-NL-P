Real Madrid have completed the signing of Jude Bellingham from Borussia Dortmund on a six-year contract. The 19-year-old moves to the Santiago Bernabeu in a deal that 90min understands will be worth an    100m plus add-ons after an outstanding three-year spell in Germany that has made Bellingham one of the most sought after players in world football. Manchester City and Liverpool had been tracking Bellingham in the hope of luring him to the Premier League, but the teenage prodigy opted to move to Madrid in mid-May and agreed personal terms with the 14-time Champions League winners. His move to the Spanish capital has now been confirmed by both Real Madrid and Dortmund, with Carlo Ancelotti now boasting a midfield talent pool that includes Aurelien Tchouameni, Eduardo Camavinga, Fede Valverde and veterans Toni Kroos and Luka Modric. Bellingham will be presented as a Real Madrid player on Thursday at noon having made 132 appearances for Dortmund. manual Manchester United had hoped to sign the then 16-year-old Bellingham from Birmingham City - Sir Alex Ferguson even met with the player's family - but he opted to follow in the footsteps of Jadon Sancho, who sealed a big-money move of his own to Old Trafford after honing his craft in the Bundesliga. It didn't take long for Bellingham to become one of Dortmund's most important players, and he finished runner-up to Pedri in the 2021 Kopa Trophy. Bellingham is already a regular fixture in Gareth Southgate's England side, too, and played a starring role for the Three Lions at the 2022 World Cup having made the squad for the delayed Euro 2020 when he was just 17 years old.
