Manchester United have confimed they have reached an agreement to sign Antony from Ajax, subject to a medical, personal terms and international clearance. 90min first reported of United's interest in the Brazilian winger back in February, and their willingness to complete a move for him only increased after hiring Erik ten Hag as their new manager. Ajax have held out for a record fee for Antony, and they have got their wish with the Red Devils set to pay them    100m including add-ons - the highest transfer fee of all time for an Eredivisie player. United submitted a    90m bid for Antony last Friday, and after it was knocked back by the Dutch champions, Antony pleaded with the club in an interview with Fabrizio Romano to let him leave.
