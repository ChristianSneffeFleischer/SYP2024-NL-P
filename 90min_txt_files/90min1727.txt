Nicolo Zaniolo has decided against accepting Bournemouth's offer to move to the Premier League, 90min understands. The Italian international was the subject of a bid from the Cherries after they were made aware of his possible availability as they closed on a deal for his team-mate Matias Vina. But while Vina is on his way to England, Zaniolo won't be joining him at the Vitality Stadium. AC Milan and Tottenham made loan offers, but both those deals have stalled which opened the door for Bournemouth to make an offer. Bournemouth offered a deal worth over    30m to Roma, which they accepted. Zaniolo at first refused to even talk terms, but later in the week he asked his agents to listen to the proposal from the Premier League minnows. They made him an offer to become their highest paid player, but after considering the deal on Friday evening, Zaniolo informed his agents that he would not be taking up the offer.
