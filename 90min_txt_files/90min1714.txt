Zenit Saint-Petersburg manager Sergei Semak has confirmed that Paris Saint-Germain are interested in signing winger Malcom this month. 25-year-old Malcom, a    41m signing for Barcelona in 2018, joined Zenit just 12 months later after his move to Camp Nou and currently sits second in the Russian league's scoring charts with 12 goals from 17 games. PSG have been touted as suitors for Malcom recently and the Ligue 1 side's interest has now been confirmed by Semak. "No official offer has been received for Malcom, but there is interest from Paris Saint-Germain," Semak told reporters.  "I spoke to him and we are waiting for a formal proposal, and if it comes, we will examine it."
