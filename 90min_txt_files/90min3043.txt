Manchester United have confirmed an agreement for the transfer of Lisandro Martinez from Ajax, subject to a medical and personal terms being agreed. The Dutch giants have revealed United will pay    57.37m ( £48.8m) for the 24-year-old, potentially rising to    67.37m ( £57.4m) with add-ons. The Argentine is set to become the third signing of the Erik ten Hag era, after Tyrell Malacia and Christian Eriksen, with United identifying the utility man as their priority defensive target some time ago.  Martinez was also strongly linked with Arsenal this summer, but 90min understands that he spurned the Gunners' advances to link back up with former Ajax manager Ten Hag.  A club statement from Man Utd read: "Manchester United is delighted to announce the club has reached agreement with Ajax for the transfer of Argentine international defender Lisandro Martinez, subject to medical, to player terms being finalised, and to UK visa requirements." Ajax also released a statement confirming the transfer fee: "Ajax and Manchester United have reached an agreement for the transfer of Lisandro Mart  nez," it read.  "The transfer is still subject to a medical examination and the contractual agreement of both clubs with the player. The defender is still under contract with Ajax until June 30, 2025. Ajax agreed a transfer fee of     57.37 million with the English side. That amount can increase to     67.37 million through variables."
