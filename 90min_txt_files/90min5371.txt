Chelsea have announced that Victor Moses has joined Spartak Moscow on loan until the end of the season. The Nigerian has not featured for the Blues since 2018 and was clearly not part of Frank Lampard's plans for the forthcoming campaign. Because of this, Moses has jumped at the chance to enjoy some first team football at Spartak.  Chelsea announced the news on their official website, wishing the 29-year-old well in the process. The move includes an option to buy, meaning that his career in the capital could be over. The latest switch is the sixth loan move of his Blues career so far. He first spent time at Liverpool during the 2013/14 campaign, taking in spells at Stoke City and West Ham afterwards. Moses has occasionally enjoyed time in the Chelsea first team, however. Most notably, he played a pivotal role in the club's 2016/17 Premier League title win. Operating as a right wing-back in Antonio Conte's 3-4-2-1 formation, Moses enjoyed the best season of his career, racking up three goals and three assists. When Conte departed the club the following season, Moses fell out of favour and was again shipped out on loan. In January 2019, he joined Turkish side Fenerbahce before reuniting with Conte at Inter almost exactly one year later.
