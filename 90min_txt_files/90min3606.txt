FC Dallas are close to signing Independiente winger Alan Velasco, putting in a   $7m bid for the 19-year-old rising talent. Argentine journalist Matias Martinez was the first to report that both sides are nearing the deal, agreeing on terms to send Velasco to the Major League Soccer side. The completion of the deal could be made as soon as this week, according to Martinez.   The player has made 69 appearances in all competitions for Independiente, recording eight goals and ten assists. He   s also featured for the Argentine national team, playing five times for the Under-17 squad and representing the side at the FIFA Under-17 World Cup.     It   s been a busy offseason for the Western Conference side, who sold USMNT breakout star Ricardo Pepi to FC Augsburg before bringing in Nanu on loan from FC Porto. Pepi   s transfer broke the club record, offloading the player for a reported $18m to the German Bundesliga side.   ?
