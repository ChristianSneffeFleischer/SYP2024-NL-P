Brighton and Hove Albion are preparing a club-record  £40m bid to sign talented centre-back Levi Colwill this summer, 90min understands. The 20-year-old centre-back was a regular under Roberto De Zerbi during his loan spell at Brighton during the 2022/23 Premier League season, becoming one of the most highly-regarded young defenders in Europe through his impressive showings. feed Following the expiration of his loan deal, Brighton have been keen to re-sign Colwill on a permanent basis. 90min understands they are now willing to make a bid in excess of  £40m to sign the defender. If that bid doesn't entice the Blues, Brighton have also told Chelsea they'd be willing to consider offering midfielder Moises Caicedo in part-exchange for Colwill. Manager De Zerbi all but confirmed Caicedo is set to leave the club this summer after his side's final game of the season, with Chelsea, Man Utd, Arsenal and Man City all retaining an interest. 90min recently reported Brighton are willing to listen to offers for their star midfielder. Despite the Seagulls' strong interest in Colwill, Chelsea currently consider the defender 'unsellable' and are keen to see how he performs in pre-season. The player himself has told the Blues he wants to leave if he is not part of the the first-team, but the club has ensured him he is indeed part of Mauricio Pochettino's first-team plans heading into the 2023/24 season.
