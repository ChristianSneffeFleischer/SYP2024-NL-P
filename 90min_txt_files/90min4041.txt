Tottenham are thought to be unhappy with Atalanta's handling of talks for Cristian Romero, with an agreement between the two clubs still yet to be reached. 23-year old Romero has been on Spurs' radar for a while, and the Premier League side recently had an opening bid of just over  £42m rejected by Atalanta - the Italians wanting around  £5m more. Talks have been continuing between the two clubs, but Italian journalist Fabrizio Romano claimed on his Twitter account on Friday that an agreement was still yet to be reached - adding that Tottenham are growing dissatisfied with the situation.  The saga becomes even more frustrating for Spurs considering their target is keen to complete the switch to the Premier League himself. It was recently revealed by 90min that Romero told his current employers of his desire to move to Tottenham. "This is a big move and a big opportunity, and personal terms have already been agreed," a source told 90min. "Romero wants to move to Tottenham and has told Atalanta as much. He does not want them to stand in his way." Spurs are going after Romero in a bid to to freshen up their backline. The club are reportedly happy to move away from Davinson Sanchez this summer, while 32-year Toby Alderweireld has already said goodbye to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium after completing a move to Qatari side Al-Duhail. The Belgian joined Spurs back in 2015 and made 236 appearances for the club before departing for the Qatar Stars League for a fee rumoured to be around the  £13m mark.
