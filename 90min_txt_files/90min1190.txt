Bayern Munich have met with the representatives of Randal Kolo Muani as they consider making a move for the Eintracht Frankfurt forward this summer, 90min understands. The 24-year-old has enjoyed an outstanding debut campaign in the Bundesliga, contributing 13 goals and ten assists in 28 appearances after joining on a free transfer from Nantes following the expiry of his contract. Kolo Muani has added a further seven goals in Champions League and DFB-Pokal competition, while he also enjoyed a prominent showing at the World Cup finals with France. Able to play anywhere across the forward line, Kolo Muani has attracted the interest of a number of top clubs through his good form - Napoli, Barcelona, Atletico Madrid, Newcastle and Paris Saint-Germain among the sides to show interest. Manchester United have also looked at Kolo Muani as they bid to sign a new number nine, but sources have confirmed to 90min that Bayern Munich are firmly in the mix and have held talks with the player's representatives over a potential summer move.  feed The Bavarians are still looking for a replacement for Robert Lewandowski, who departed for Barcelona last summer, and are exploring their options with Sadio Mane's arrival not working out as planned. Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting has led the line for Bayern for most of the season, with Mane playing a peripheral role because of injury and ill-discipline, but he's 34 and unlikely to fire Bayern to domestic and European glory - his ten-goal return this season is the best of his career to date. Frankfurt would like to keep Kolo Muani for one more season and have made it clear up to this point they do not want to sell, but 90min understands that they will allow him to leave if their valuation is met - though it may take a bid close to    100m for Bayern or any other interested party to get a deal done.
