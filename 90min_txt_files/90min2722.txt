Exclusive - The New York Red Bulls have rejected two offers for Scottish forward Lewis Morgan this summer, 90min understands.  Morgan joined the Red Bulls from Inter Miami ahead of the 2022 MLS season for $1.2m General Allocation Money (GAM) - a then-record figure for guaranteed GAM. Since then, Morgan has proved a hit at Red Bull Arena, scoring 11 goals in 24 MLS appearances - at least six more than any other teammate - while he's first among RBNY players for chances created (32) and tackles (104).  1     £... 2     £... 3     £... Hat trick for Lewis Morgan! #RBNY pic.twitter.com/qdUuYWI9Kb Naturally, Morgan's form has attracted the attention of clubs in Europe. Sources tell 90min that RBNY have already turned down two bids from Championship clubs this summer, with Huddersfield offering around  £750k ($905k) plus add-ons, while Millwall attempted to sign the former Celtic man on loan.  90min understands that there remains substantial interest in Morgan among clubs in the English second tier, while the player himself would be open to making a move back to the United Kingdom should the chance arise. Beginning his professional career with a 118-game spell at Scottish Premiership side St. Mirren between 2014 and 2018, Morgan has also represented Celtic and Sunderland during his time in British soccer. Still thinking about this Lewis Morgan volley.      // @NewYorkRedBulls pic.twitter.com/0HEqFtjEZb Moving to MLS with Inter Miami in 2020 proved to be a revolutionary move for Morgan, who was named the Herons' first-ever MVP that year.  Across all competitions this season, Morgan has 14 goals and three assists to his name in 28 appearances for RBNY, often figuring as a No.10 in Gerhard Struber's 3-4-2-1 formation, while the 25-year-old can also play as a winger or wing-back.
