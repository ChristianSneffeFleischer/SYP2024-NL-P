Fernando Llorente has claimed Real Madrid made multiple unsuccessful attempts to sign him earlier in his career, but would happily join Los Blancos even now as a back-up to Karim Benzema. Llorente made his name with Athletic Club, progressing through the Basque club   s youth ranks, becoming one of La Liga   s most consistent strikers by the late 2000s. He eventually left for Juventus on a free transfer in 2013, before later going on to have spells of varying success with Sevilla, Swansea, Tottenham, Napoli, Udinese and Eibar. As of now, a 37-year-old Llorente is a free agent following his departure from second tier Eibar at the end of last season. Internationally, he won the 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012 with Spain.    I never really was [close to joining Real Madrid],    he admitted in quotes published by Marca.    Whenever  Real Madrid  wanted me I was under contract at  Athletic, and well...Athletic  never wanted to let me go and  Madrid  never wanted to pay my release clause at the time. When the opportunity was there...Juventus  were quicker.    Llorente continued,    I would have liked to wear the white shirt. Right now  Real Madrid  are the best team in the world and it's incredible what they are doing in the Champions League. Of course [I would join them tomorrow]. Of course.
