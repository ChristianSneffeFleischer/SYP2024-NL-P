Newcastle United are set to make an offer for Inter midfielder Nicolo Barella, sources have confirmed to 90min. Newcastle are aiming to bring in two midfielders this summer and Barella has emerged as a player very high on their radar. Newcastle's owners, the Saudi PIF, are ready to back Eddie Howe in the transfer market with a bumper transfer budget and would need a sizeable sum to land a target like Barella. 90min understands that the Magpies are ready to tempt Inter with a deal worth  £50m, but it remains to be seen if that would be enough as the likes of Liverpool and Paris Saint-Germain have previously been told that it would take nearer to  £75m to land the 26-year-old.  Italian sources have stressed that an agreement for Barella is not close to being reached at this point. feed One of the stars of Inter's run to the Champions League final, Barella is understood to be happy with the Nerazzurri and sources insist it would take 'something special' to persuade him to leave the club. Newcastle, who are also pushing hard to beat Tottenham to the signing of James Maddison, could meet with Inter this week with their sporting director Piero Ausilio due to fly into London. Ausilio is set to meet with Chelsea about various issues including Andre Onana, Romelu Lukaku and Kalidou Koulibaly - but he is believed to be meeting other clubs as well. Aside from Barella, Newcastle have been making enquiries about a number of younger players as they look to bolster their player pool. Having completed a deal for teenage Gambian winger Yankuba Minteh from OB in Denmark, they have also enquired about Wolfsburg's Felix Nmecha and Rennes midfielder Desire Doue.
