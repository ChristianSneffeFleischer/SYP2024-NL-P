As is all too often the case, the individual that lent their name to a significant ruling didn't benefit from the law change. Jean-Marc Bosman's disgust at being discarded by Standard Liege in the 1990s ultimately led to the freedom of movement among out-of-contract footballers; a Bosman transfer. However, the litigious Belgian never reaped the rewards of his legal victory, rapidly spiralling out of the limelight before hitting the nadir of an assault charge in 2013. Bosman may not have been a beneficiary, but clubs from across Europe continue to exploit the free agent market. As league campaigns across the continent conclude, clubs will be sniffing out a bargain.
