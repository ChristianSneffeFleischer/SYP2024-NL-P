Serie A giants AC Milan have confirmed the signing of US men's national team midfielder Yunus Musah from Valencia. The 2021/22 Scudetto winners have splashed the cash this summer after Sandro Tonali joined Newcastle, with Musah now the second USMNT player to join the historic Italian side after star forward Christian Pulisic made the move from Chelsea to Milan earlier this summer. The 20-year-old leaves La Liga side Valencia after making 108 appearances and scoring five goals in all competitions. Before joining Valencia in 2019, Musah was part of Arsenal's U18 squad from October 2017 to August 2019. At the international level, Musah represented England at the U17 and U18 level before switching his allegiance to the US in 2020. He's 27 appearances for the USMNT since 2020 and was key to the Stars and Stripes' Nations League triumphs in 2019/20 and 2022/23. "AC Milan is pleased to announce the signing of Yunus Musah on a permanent basis. The midfielder has signed a contract with the Club until 30 June 2028," an AC Milan club statement read.        The ink is dry, and the future is bright!                #ACMQuest #SempreMilan pic.twitter.com/k8Tl84wUWH
