Chelsea Women forward Bethany England has committed her long-term future to the reigning Women   s Super League champions by signing a new four-year contract until 2024. It is a tremendous show of faith in England and a sign of the increasingly professional and long-term approach in the women   s game, where contracts are more typically much shorter.  Great news! ? @BethanyEngland4 has signed a four-year contract extension with the Blues! ? #CFCW #CFC #Chelsea A post shared by  Chelsea Football Club Women (@chelseafcw) on Jul 29, 2020 at 5:02am PDT With an unbeaten Chelsea awarded the title on points per game when the 2019/20 was abandoned due to the difficulties attached with restarting amid the coronavirus crisis, England finished second in the WSL Golden Boot race and was crowned the WSL   s Barclays Player of the Season. All in all, England got 21 goals in 24 appearances in all competitions and also established herself at international level as a member of the Lionesses squad.    It means a lot to me, especially being at such a great club that Chelsea is,    the 26-year-old told the club   s official website in reference to her new contract.    I   ve spent a lot of time here already, so being able to extend that and hopefully kick on with what I   ve already achieved at this club is exciting.    Team general manager Tom Green commented,       We   re delighted to have extended Beth   s contract, as she has been outstanding in the last 18 months, playing a big part in the team   s success. We feel that she is now coming in to her peak as a player and look forward to seeing how she continues to develop for both club and country in the upcoming years.    England started the 2019/20 campaign with a stunning goal against Tottenham in front of 25,000 people at Stamford Bridge and later scored in eight consecutive WSL games between November and February, a run of results which ultimately secured Chelsea the title.
