Manchester United have confirmed the loan signing of midfielder Marcel Sabitzer on loan until the end of the 2022/23 season. The Red Devils were forced into the market late in the January transfer window after it was confirmed that Christian Eriksen is likely to miss up to four months of action due to an ankle injury.  As 90min confirmed, the club entered talks with Sabitzer over a potential move to Old Trafford on loan for the remainder of the season on Tuesday, and were able to get the deal through before the 12pm deadline after receiving an extension.
