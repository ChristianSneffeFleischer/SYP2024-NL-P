Leicester City have completed the signing of midfielder Harry Winks from Tottenham on a permanent basis. The two clubs did business late last month as James Maddison moved to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium for a fee of around  Â£40m, and Winks has now sealed his move in the opposite direction. "I   m delighted," Winks said after joining Leicester. "I   m really excited for the challenge ahead. It   s an amazing club with great history and the facilities are incredible. I   m just so happy to be here and ready to get going. "I   m looking forward to getting started, to have a full pre-season with the team and come here early to get ready for the games coming up. It   s going to be an important few weeks to get everyone ready and to push myself getting fit.  "I   m also looking forward to a new challenge and to challenge myself. Coming to a club like Leicester is the perfect chance to do that." feed A boyhood Tottenham fan, Winks came through the club's academy and went on to make 203 appearances for Spurs, chipping in with five goals and six assists. The 27-year-old even managed ten caps for England between 2017 and 2020 but lost his place in the international setup as he fell out of favour at club level. Winks started just nine Premier League games in the 2021/22 campaign and would join Serie A side Sampdoria on loan last summer. An ankle injury delayed his start in Italy but Winks became a core part of the Italian side's midfield. His loan to Sampdoria did include an option to buy which was not triggered after their relegation to Serie B, and now Winks has accepted a drop down to the Championship with Leicester.
