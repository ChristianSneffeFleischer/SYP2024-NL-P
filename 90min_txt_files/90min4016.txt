Barcelona midfielder Ilaix Moriba looks increasingly likely to leave Camp Nou after rejecting the club   s offer of a new contract, president Joan Laporta has confirmed. Bar  a have had high hopes for Moriba after he burst onto the scene in the second half of last season and made 18 appearances for the first-team, including four starts in La Liga. However, the youngster   s current contract is due to expire in 2022 and he has informed the club that he doesn   t wish to sign a new one with the terms that are on the table.    He has a year on his deal and doesn   t want to renew with the conditions offered by the club,    Laporta said as he explained the situation to the media. Laporta clear on Ilaix: He has a year on his deal & doesn   t want to renew with the conditions offered by the club. So we have to send a message. He   s a great player but if he doesn   t renew there are other solutions. I feel bad but the club comes first    We have to send a message,    the president continued, hinting that Bar  a will refuse to bend over backwards to keep the 18-year-old.    He   s a great player but if he doesn   t renew there are other solutions. I feel bad but the club comes first. "I ask him to reconsider and come to an agreement. I don   t understand why he doesn   t recognise what Bar  a have done for him.    Laporta added that Moriba will be allowed to leave, but only if a club makes a suitable offer. It was reported over the weekend that Bar  a have become    fed up    of Moriba   s contract demands and have no intention of improving their offer to meet said demands, as Laporta has now alluded to. Moriba has been left out of Bar  a   s pre-season trip to Germany and Austria, while it has been suggested that he will be excluded from first-team training until he signs the contract on offer.
