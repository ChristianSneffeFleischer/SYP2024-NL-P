Newcastle United are in talks with Vasco da Gama over midfield starlet Andrey Santos, and 90min understands that they are also keen on his teammate Eguinaldo. The Magpies are working hard to find some of the world   s top young talents and in the last few weeks secured the signing of Australian starlet Garang Kuol. Holding midfielder Santos is a player that has been on Newcastle   s radar for more than 12 months, and lines of communication between the two clubs have been open since the summer. Vasco are believed to be looking at a deal worth over  Â£20m for the midfielder, as they believe him to be one of the best young players in Brazil, and Newcastle have not been scared off by such a price tag. Indeed, Newcastle are confident a deal can be agreed, but 90min can also confirm that they have also enquired about fellow 18-year-old Eguinaldo. Eguinaldo is a forward who can play across the front three, and like Santos, has enjoyed an impressive season thus far in Brazil   s top flight. Eguinaldo has only just broken into the Vasco first team this season and has shown his ability with three goals in six starts, and his form has also seen him recognised internationally after being called up to Brazil   s Under-20 squad for the first time.
