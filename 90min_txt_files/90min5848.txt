Barcelona presidential hopeful Victor Font has admitted that Lionel Messi reversing his recent transfer request and staying at Camp Nou is unlikely, suggesting it is already too late to go back to the way things were before last week   s seismic developments. Font is trying to get elected as president to replace under pressure incumbent Josep Maria Bartomeu early next year. But while he says he would do as much as he can to get Messi to stay, the most likely outcome is just ensuring it is an amicable parting of ways after 20 years. Speaking to Sky Sports, Font said:    Until it's over there is always hope. And therefore I really hope the decision can be changed. It doesn't seem likely, though, and therefore if that's the case, the focus should be on making the transition as smooth as possible.    The relationship between club and player is already threatening to sour, with each side differently interpreting the clause in Messi   s contract that allowed him to leave for free this summer. That has prompted a legal battle and the 33-year-old has not been reporting for training.    I would try, as much as possible [to keep him]. But I think we also need to ensure that the dynamics, the legal battle between the club and Lionel Messi, stop,    Font explained.    We sit down, we talk. He loves the club, the club loves him, so let's make sure we don't get into an even worse situation.  Where will @LeoMessi be playing next season? ? - - - #leomessi #messi  #barcelona #fcb #barca #campnou #mancity #mcfc #psg #paris #inter #internazionale #seriea #italy #laliga #premierleague #epl #pl #ligue1 #football #90min A post shared by  90min (@90min_football) on Aug 28, 2020 at 10:55am PDT    There is an inconsistency, right? Probably due to mismanagement by the current administration and the current board, trying to hide behind these wrongdoings. That's why it's extremely important to the history of the club that we do what it takes.    Barcelona are refusing to negotiate a transfer fee below a    700m buyout clause and La Liga have publicly backed the Catalans, insisting any club wishing to sign Messi must trigger that clause.
