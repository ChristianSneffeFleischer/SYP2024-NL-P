Juventus have been one of the most active clubs in the summer transfer window thus far, making high profile moves for Paul Pogba, Angel Di Maria and Gleison Bremer, as well as selling star defender Matthijs de Ligt to Bayern Munich.  They look set to be even more active before the window slams shut at the start of September too, with the club being linked for moves for a forward, a midfielder and a new full-back.  Here's everything 90min knows about these pursuits:  90min understand that Juventus are interested in Liverpool's Roberto Firmino and have approached intermediaries about a possible move to Turin. However, Liverpool are currently showing very little interest in selling the Brazilian international this summer.  Jurgen Klopp has even publicly stated that Firmino remains 'crucial' for Liverpool. With that in mind, La Vecchia Signora are targeting Alvaro Morata as their 'preferred' striker option this summer. The Spain international spent the last two seasons on loan at Juve, scoring 32 goals in all competitions before returning to Atletico Madrid in June. Juventus had a    35m option to sign Morata the end of his loan deal, but have allowed him to return to Atleti in the hope of getting negotiating a smaller fee. 90min can also report that the Bianconeri have been offered the chance to sign Barcelona's Memphis Depay and Chelsea's Timo Werner. With Paul Pogba potentially out until the end of the year due to a knee injury, 90min understands that Juve are still very much interested in signing Chelsea's Jorginho.  We reported back in May that Chelsea were willing to let the midfielder leave Stamford Bridge this summer and that the player's preferred move - if he were to leave - would be to Serie A.
