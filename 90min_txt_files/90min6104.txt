Newcastle are plotting loan moves for Chelsea attacking midfielder Conor Gallagher  and Liverpool winger Harry Wilson ahead of the 2020/21 campaign. The Magpies' proposed  £350m takeover fell through at the end of July after Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund pulled out, ending hopes of a lavish summer of spending at St James' Park. Mike Ashley's natural stinginess coupled with the financial impact of the coronavirus means Steve Bruce will likely be restricted to a budget of around  £35m in the transfer window. As a result, the Newcastle boss will be forced to turn his attentions to the loan market, and according to the Northern Echo, Gallagher and Wilson top his wish list. However, a deal for either player will not come easily, with the pair both in high demand after impressing out on loan last season. Gallagher spent the season at Swansea, scoring six goals and providing 11 assists in 45 Championship appearances as the Swans made the playoffs during a dramatic final day of the season. The 20-year-old is eager to try his hand at the Premier League, but with Chelsea's squad already filled with attacking talent and a heavy summer of spending in the pipeline, his opportunities in the Blues first team will likely be limited. Newcastle have formally registered their interest in Gallagher - but so have at least eight other clubs, including Crystal Palace and West Ham. The England international was born and raised just south of London, meaning the Eagles and the Hammers may have a geographical advantage over Newcastle when it comes to attracting Gallagher. Wilson meanwhile enjoyed an impressive year out on loan at Derby during the 2018/19 campaign, before joining Bournemouth the following season.
