Virgil van Dijk threw a fierce jab at Manchester United when asked about Cody Gakpo's imminent future at club level. Gakpo scored three times in the group stages of the World Cup and has become one of the tournament's most courted stars. 90min understands Man Utd are now convinced the PSV Eindhoven forward is ready for the Premier League and manager Erik ten Hag is pushing for a transfer soon. Real Madrid have also been linked with a move for the 23-year-old, though when both European giants were put to Van Dijk as potential destinations for Gakpo, the Liverpool defender dismissed his side's bitter rivals. Asked if Gakpo is ready for a new challenge after the last 16 victory over the United States, he responded:    Are Manchester United and Real Madrid the same level at this moment? No disrespect, not at all.    I think he definitely has a next step in him. I definitely feel like it could happen.
