Slavia Prague right-back Vladimir Coufal will undergo a medical with West Ham on Thursday as the two clubs agreed a fee for the player. The 28-year-old, who has appeared in the Champions League for the Czech side, was the subject of a rejected loan bid by the Hammers earlier in the week. Manager David Moyes has been keen to strengthen his defensive options for some time now and had identified Coufal as the ideal player to compete with Ryan Fredericks for the right-back spot.  It would now seem as though West Ham have got their man. On Wednesday evening, Slavia president Jaroslav Tvrdik confirmed the news that a bid had been accepted for Coufal via social media, with the fee reported to be around  Â£5m.  "I had to thank the great warrior Vladim  r Coufal for his fantastic spell in Slavia. The deal for EUR 6m was signed, he moves to @WestHam. The last condition is the medical tomorrow in London. Thank you and good luck in PL!"Chairman of Board Jaroslav Tvrd  k on @Coufi5 https://t.co/GEAS3d4UV9 Coufal, a former teammate of West Ham's Tomas Soucek, has also impressed at international level. Capped eight times by the Czech Republic, Coufal impressed during their EURO 2020 qualifying win over England last year and recently scored his first international goal in a win over Slovakia.  He would also represent West Ham's first summer signing. After months of frustration at the London Stadium, it would appear as if the club are moving to strengthen their porous backline. Bids for Burnley's James Tarkowski and St Etienne's Wesley Fofana have been rejected and Moyes has been keen to sign players who would strengthen the first-team after years of failed transfers by the club.
