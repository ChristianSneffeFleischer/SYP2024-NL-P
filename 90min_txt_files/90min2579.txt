Manchester City are in discussions with Borussia Dortmund over a deal for Manuel Akanji, 90min understands. The Switzerland international has less than a year left to run on his contract at Signal-Iduna Park and has not made an appearance so far this season. He has been linked with moves to Leicester and Manchester United in recent times, but 90min understands talks are ongoing with Man City over a move instead. John Stones' poor start to the season and the need for Nathan Ake to cover at left-back following Oleksandr Zinchenko's departure means Pep Guardiola is looking towards the transfer market to find a solution. A deal for Akanji is expected to cost less than  Â£15m, which makes him an attractive option to Man City. The Premier League champions have already brought in Erling Haaland, Kalvin Phillips, Stefan Ortega Moreno and Sergio Gomez this summer, while Julian Alvarez has joined up with the squad after his January signing from River Plate. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  &  Toby Cudworth  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Lucas Paqueta's move to West Ham, Chelsea's plans to sign Anthony Gordon, Wesley Fofana and Arsen Zakharyan and the latest from Old Trafford.
