Leeds United were    very serious    about trying to sign Stuttgart striker Nicolas Gonzalez this summer, the German club   s sporting director Sven Mislintat has confirmed. But a deal is not currently considered likely unless Leeds improve their offers to both the player and club. Only turning 22 in April, Gonzalez enjoyed a breakout season with Stuttgart in 2019/20, scoring 14 times in 2. Bundesliga to help drive Stuttgart   s promotion back to the top flight. His form piqued Leeds    interest, but Mislintat, a former head of recruitment at Arsenal, has revealed that Stuttgart have not been in a position where a deal to sell has been close.    I don't see [a departure] coming for now,    Mislintat told the German media this week, as reported by the Yorkshire Evening Post.    We had a lot of rumours in the beginning. It was very serious with Leeds. But at no point it was really convincing for him or for us.    Leeds secured the permanent signing of Helder Costa last month and recently also brought in Wigan teenager Joe Gelhardt, but the club is keen to further strengthen in attacking areas to ensure that a first spell back in the Premier League in 16 years lasts longer than one season.
