Aston Villa have confirmed they have reached an agreement with Sevilla over the signing of central defender Diego Carlos for an undisclosed fee. The Brazilian had been heavily linked with a move to Newcastle during the January transfer window, having impressed for a Nervionenses side that won the 2019/20 Europa League. However, the Magpies - alongside fellow interested parties Arsenal, Tottenham and West Ham - have been beaten to the punch by Villa, who are keen to make another splash in the market this summer. Their statement reads: "Aston Villa can confirm the Club has reached an agreement with Sevilla FC for the transfer of Diego Carlos for an undisclosed fee. "The player will travel to England in the next few hours to complete a medical and finalise personal terms. A statement from Sevilla adds: "Sevilla FC would like to thank the player for his work during all these years in Seville and wishes him the best of luck in his new journey."
