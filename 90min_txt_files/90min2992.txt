Carlo Ancelotti has suggested that Real Madrid will not make any further signings this summer, though admitted some players could still depart the Santiago Bernabeu. The European champions have welcomed two new players to the club this window, with Antonio Rudiger joining from Chelsea on a free transfer and Aurelien Tchouameni signing for a nine-figure sum from Monaco. Though this could be considered a quiet window by Real Madrid's standards - particularly after missing out on the signing of Kylian Mbappe - Ancelotti has revealed that he will not add anymore players to his squad for the upcoming season. "The squad is closed and it is better than last year," he said. "Two new players have come in and they are going to add a lot. There are 27 players [in the squad], it   s a lot and coaching them is not easy, but the ones I have are intelligent and they understand the difficulty I have."
