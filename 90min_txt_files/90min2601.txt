Ajax forward Antony is to undergo a medical at Manchester United on Monday after the Red Devils finalised terms on a Dutch record deal, 90min can confirm. United verbally agreed to pay    100m ( £85m) - which includes add-ons - for Antony on Saturday, as 90min revealed, and the finer details were hammered out by the two sides over the remainder of the weekend. 13-time Premier League champions United had lodged three previous bids for Antony, the last of which was worth    90m ( £76.7m), but had seen Ajax dismiss the offers as they sought a club-record sale. Indeed, the Eredivisie giants have stood firm on their lofty valuation of Antony all summer long, and have demanded that United exceed the    92m ( £78m) received from Barcelona for Frenkie de Jong in 2019. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  &  Toby Cudworth  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Lucas Paqueta's potential move to West Ham, Chelsea's plans to sign Anthony Gordon, Wesley Fofana and Arsen Zakharyan and the latest from Old Trafford.
