Bayern Munich forward Sadio Mane is a new target for Saudi Pro League side Al Ettifaq, who are managed by Liverpool legend Steven Gerrard, sources have told 90min. Mane, an Anfield icon in his own right, swapped Merseyside for Bavaria last summer following an incredibly successful six-year spell with the Reds. He was tipped to hit those same heights at the Allianz Arena, and while Bayern just about managed to win an 11th-successive Bundesliga title, Mane underperformed and found himself at the centre of controversy when he got into a fight with Leroy Sane towards the end of the season. In 38 games across all competitions, Mane scored 12 goals and added six assists for Bayern. feed 90min reported in June that Mane was wanted by clubs in the Saudi Pro League, but he was not giving any thought to a move to the Middle East. However, 90min now understands Bayern are trying to move Mane on and they see Saudi Arabia as an ideal landing spot as there is scarce interest from across Europe. Al Ettifaq, who recently appointed Gerrard as manager and want to sign Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson, want to challenge the league's PIF-owned clubs - Al Ahli, Al Ittihad, Al Hilal and Al Nassr - for Mane. In addition to Mane and Henderson, Al Ettifaq remain in talks with Aston Villa over the signing of another ex-teammate of Gerrard's - Philippe Coutinho. The Brazilian emerged as one of the former midfielder's first transfer targets upon taking the job.
