Thomas Meunier has signed a four-year deal with Borussia Dortmund, with the right back to leave PSG on a free transfer. Meunier's deal with the Ligue 1 outfit expires on 30 June, and he had turned down the opportunity to negotiate a contract extension prior to the coronavirus outbreak. The global pandemic resulted in the French season concluding prematurely, with Meunier picking up his third Ligue 1 title with PSG. However, the French champions have qualified for the Champions League quarter-finals and therefore still have European fixtures to fulfil in August. While Layvin Kurzawa and Thiago Silva are poised to sign short-term extensions to stay with PSG for the remainder of their Champions League campaign, according to Bild, Meunier is on his way out and has signed a four-year deal with Borussia Dortmund.  An RMC Sport report stated that the defender had been offered a short-term deal to keep him in France to see out PSG's Champions League fixtures, but he has opted not to accept in order to seal his move to Dortmund sooner. Tottenham had also been in pursuit of Meunier, with Jose Mourinho keen on adding a new full back to his squad this summer. The Spurs budget has been stretched further as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, and snapping up Meunier on a free would have been ideal business for Daniel Levy.
