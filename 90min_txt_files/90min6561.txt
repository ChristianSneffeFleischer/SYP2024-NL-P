Inter could be set to do Manchester United an almighty favour - some would argue - as discussions are taking place about the possibility of extending Alexis Sanchez's loan at San Siro by another 12 months. Following his high-profile swap move from Arsenal, the Chilean, who previously tore up the Premier League, simply forgot to turn up. His form dropped off a cliff and he lost his place in the side.

Talks have already taken place to extend his deal briefly to make up for the months lost during football's halt - which would allow him to complete the season - but Sky Italia have revealed that Inter are exploring the option of renewing the loan for another year on top of that. Obvious financial restrictions could hamper the deal, as Inter would likely need to stump up  £175k of  Sanchez's   £390k weekly salary, just as they had done for this season. However, the move is not considered 'impossible', with talks ongoing. On the face of it, it's a deal which suits both parties. Conte can retain some depth in his squad for the next campaign, meanwhile Ole Gunnar Solskjaer will be temporarily rid of player he has little faith in. The reduced salary they'll need to pay will also be a welcome relief.
