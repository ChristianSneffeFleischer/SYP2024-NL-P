On 9 September 2020, Aston Villa forked out a staggering fee for Championship Player of the Year Ollie Watkins, in a deal that could be worth up to  £33m.  In the process, Watkins became the most expensive player to ever be bought from a Championship club (excluding relegated players), but he wasn't the only player from the second tier to move for big money that summer.  Birmingham City teenager Jude Bellingham went overseas to join Borussia Dortmund, while QPR's Eberechi Eze and Nottingham Forest's Matty Cash both secured Premier League moves for eight-figure sums.  Buying from the Championship is always a risky move, especially with such massive fees involved. Some have thrived, but others haven't been able to adjust to the higher division. Here are the 30 most expensive Championship players of all time. Best remembered for his comically awkward announcement video, Jordan Hugill played just 22 minutes for the Hammers. After a couple of loan spells at Middlesbrough and QPR, he was sold to Norwich for a significant loss.Verdict: Miss In January 2016, Bournemouth smashed their transfer record to bring Wolves striker Benik Afobe to the Vitality Stadium.After an encouraging start to life in the top flight, Afobe went off the boil, scoring 11 goals in 70 appearances for the Cherries. However, Bournemouth were able to recoup the  £10m they paid for him.Verdict: Miss Scotland international Jordan Rhodes was one of the most prolific forwards in the Championship at Blackburn, so it was no surprise when promotion-chasing Middlesbrough splashed out the big bucks to bring him further north in January 2016.Although he helped them achieve automatic promotion, Rhodes never recaptured his best form at the Riverside and failed to net a single goal in the following Premier League campaign. Although, like Afobe, Boro managed to break even on the transfer when he was sold to Sheffield Wednesday in 2017.Verdict: Miss Following their promotion in 2018, Neil Warnock's Cardiff needed someone who could score goals; so Bristol City's Bobby Decordova-Reid was brought in for a hefty fee.He only netted five times as a Bluebird, before he was on his bike again to join Fulham.Verdict: Miss Having established himself as one of the brightest young talents in the division, Wilfried Zaha was Sir Alex Ferguson's last signing as Manchester United boss, for a fee of  £10m with potential  £5m add-ons.Things didn't work out for the youngster, who made just four appearances for the Red Devils before being sold back to Selhurst Park for a massive loss.Verdict: Miss Newly-promoted Burnley brought in Jeff Hendrick from Derby County on deadline day 2016 for a then-club record fee.The Irishman made 122 Premier League appearances for the Clarets, scoring nine times. He may not have been a superstar, but Hendrick was an ever-reliable asset to Sean Dyche's side.Verdict: Hit Off the back of their relegation to the second tier, Fulham raised eyebrows all over the country when they shelled out  £11m to bring Golden Boot winner Ross McCormack to Craven Cottage.While the Whites underperformed, McCormack shone, scoring 38 league goals in two seasons - effectively keeping them in the Championship single-handedly.He was later sold on for a profit, but more on that later.Verdict: Hit Jonathan Kodjia enjoyed a fantastic debut season at Ashton Gate, scoring 19 goals. This prompted Aston Villa to bring the Ivorian to the Midlands in a deal worth  £11m with an extra  £4m in add-ons.Kodjia managed to equal his previous season's tally in his first campaign at Villa Park in nine fewer games. However, injuries and high competition for places left the former Reims man out of favour under manager Dean Smith, and he was let go to Qatari side Al-Ghafara in January 2020.Verdict: Miss  With a Player of the Year award in 2013 and a Golden Boot in 2018, Matej Vydra was one of the Championship's most emphatic forwards.However, he has never managed to replicate this form in the Premier League and has often found himself stuck on the bench at Burnley.Verdict: Miss Another player brought in following Cardiff's promotion, Josh Murphy joined from Norwich for  £11m in 2018.His career in Wales hasn't hit the heights that many hoped it would, but there's plenty of time to turns things around.Verdict: Miss Wales international David Brooks moved to the south coast in 2018 for a sizeable sum, aged just 21 at the time.The former Sheffield United man enjoyed a fine debut season at the Cherries, scoring seven and finishing as the club's third top scorer.A long-term ankle injury kept him out for large parts of the 2019/20 campaign as Bournemouth were relegated. Nonetheless, Brooks has done well at the Vitality.Verdict: Hit Sure to cause tension at the next Sunday roast in the Murphy household, Jacob Murphy was sold to Newcastle for  £1m more than twin brother Josh.Much like his brother, Jacob Murphy's career has gone downhill since leaving Carrow Road, struggling for minutes at St. James' Park. He has had spells on loan at West Brom and Sheffield Wednesday.Verdict: Miss  Patrick Roberts had attracted a lot of attention for his performances at Craven Cottage, leading to his  £12m move to Manchester City.Roberts has since made just one league appearance for the Cityzens, with his most notable contribution at the Etihad being a goal for Celtic against his parent club in a Champions League group stage game.Verdict: Miss While languishing in mid-table, Aston Villa forked out for one of the division's top marksmen on deadline day of January 2017.The Republic of Ireland international managed to find the net just seven times for the Villans in 56 outings, and was later sold to Birmingham City for a loss.Verdict: Miss Following the same path as Hogan, Ezri Konsa joined Dean Smith's ranks after an impressive season at the Bees.The 22-year-old made 25 league appearances in his debut season at Villa Park, regularly partnering England international Tyrone Mings at centre-back.Verdict: Hit Following an encouraging two seasons at Griffin Park, Eddie Howe's Bournemouth splashed out  £12m for the services of the young Welshman.A serious knee injury kept him out for large parts of his debut season, but the Wales international has all the qualities required to put that disappointment behind him.Verdict: Miss Another Cherries defender joins the list.After breaking through the ranks at Bristol City, Kelly made the switch to the Vitality Stadium in the summer of 2019. Unfortunately, his career in red and black has been blighted by injuries, with the England Under-21 international making just eight appearances as Bournemouth were relegated.Verdict: Miss Burke made a flying start to the 2016/17 Championship season, scoring in four of his first five games. This encouraged newly-promoted RB Leipzig to take a gamble on the youngster.The move had mixed success. He only made five starts for Die Roten Bullen, scoring just once. However, the Bundesliga side were somehow able to sell him a year later for a  £2m profit, so it wasn't a complete disaster.Verdict: Miss Making his second appearance on this list, McCormack was brought to Villa Park for a hefty price in 2016. Unfortunately for the Midlands side, his signing was a miserable failure. McCormack scored only three goals for the club before falling out with manager Steve Bruce over fitness and attitude problems.Verdict: Miss After finishing the 2016/17 season as the Championship's top scorer, Leeds United forward Chris Wood was snapped up by Burnley in the summer transfer window.Since his arrival, Wood has been Sean Dyche's top scorer at Turf Moor and continues to bully Premier League defences week after week.Verdict: Hit What on Earth happened to Ben Gibson?The Middlesbrough man looked to be a promising young centre-back, earning an England call up in 2017. So when Burnley made the decision to spend  £15m on the Englishman, it seemed like a shrewd signing.Wrong. One appearance and loan spells later, he's been a complete waste of money.Verdict: Miss Ralph Hasenhuttl opted to spend the big bucks to bring Birmingham City striker Che Adams to St. Mary's. Did it work out?Well, for a long time it looked like he would be a disaster signing, as Adams failed to score in any of his first 24 outings. However, four goals in six games towards the end of the 2019/20 season turned things around.Alongside Danny Ings, Adams is now flourishing - but still has a long way to go.Verdict: Miss Arriving from Swansea in 2019, Daniel James wasn't exactly the marquee signing that Manchester United fans were looking for. However, after scoring three in his first four appearances, it looked like the Red Devils had picked themselves up a bargain.It's been all downhill from there, especially after the Welshman lost his place to 18-year-old Mason Greenwood. And, with the club still looking to secure a deal for Jadon Sancho, it is looking increasingly unlikely that he'll ever find his way back into the starting XI at Old Trafford.Verdict: Miss Britt Assombalonga established himself as one of the second tier's top strikers after three successful years at Nottingham Forest. Seeking an instant return to the Premier League, Middlesbrough coughed up  £15m for the DR Congo international.While Boro struggled for promotion, Assombalonga has had a decent spell up north, netting approximately a quarter of Middlesbrough's league goals between 2017//18 and 2019/20.Verdict: Hit Daniel James wasn't the only Swansea player to make the step up to the Premier League during 2019/20 as newly-promoted Sheffield United brought Scottish forward Oli McBurnie to Bramall Lane.While his tally of six goals wasn't exactly groundbreaking, McBurnie ended the season as the Blades' top scorer - helping Chris Wilder secure a surprise top ten finish.Verdict: Hit  The Spaniard had struggled to make an impact in the top flight with Aston Villa and Middlesbrough, gaining a reputation as a player who was all physique and no end product. However, he began to emerge as a more complete player when Tony Pulis arrived at the Riverside.Traore's performances in the 2017/18 Championship earned him a move to Molineux, and he hasn't looked back since. The former Barcelona man is now one of the most feared wingers in the league, despite some very average 2020/21 displays.Verdict: Hit Centre-back Adam Webster joined the Seagulls off the back of an impressive season at Bristol City - winning their Player of the Year award for the 2018/19 campaign. Since arriving at the AMEX, Webster has formed a solid partnership with Lewis Dunk and is a regular starter each and every week.Verdict: Hit After finishing as runner up to Norwich's Teemu Pukki in the Championship Golden Boot race, French forward Neal Maupay earned a big money move to Brighton.He netted ten goals in his debut season at the Amex, and even ruffled a number of Arsenal feathers during a feisty home game. Plenty more to come too.Verdict: Hit James Maddison enjoyed a sensational 2017/18 season, recording 14 goals and eight assists in a mid-table Norwich side, so it was no surprise when he got his move to the Premier League.At Leicester City, he's become one of the most reliable attacking midfielders in the country, helping the Foxes establish themselves as credible Champions League qualification contenders.Verdict: Hit
