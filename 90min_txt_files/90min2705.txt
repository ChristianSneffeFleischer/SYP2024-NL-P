Chelsea have completed the signing of Italian midfielder Cesare Casadei from Inter on a permanent deal. The 19-year-old, who is yet to play a minute of senior football, impressed at this summer's European Under-19 Championships opposite England's Carney Chukwuemeka, who joined Chelsea for around  Â£20m earlier this window. Casadei has now followed suit, putting pen to paper on a six-year contract in a deal which 90min understands is worth an initial    15m, plus a further    5m in add-ons. "Cesare is a player we have tracked for some time and we are delighted that he has now agreed to join Chelsea, where he will initially strengthen our Under-21s squad," said head of youth development Neil Bath.  "He is another exciting emerging talent who we are looking forward to seeing develop and progress further as he breaks into senior football in the coming years." Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  &  Toby Cudworth  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Erik ten Hag wanting to sign five players before the transfer window closes, and Man Utd's attitude to selling Cristiano Ronaldo.
