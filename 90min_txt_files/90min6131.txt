Manchester City have confirmed the signing of young winger Ferran Torres from Valencia on a long-term deal. Following the decision to overturn Man CIty's ban from Europe, the club have been linked with a number of players. With Pep Guardiola seeking a replacement for the departed Leroy Sane, Torres was identified as the player who could fill the role.  The Spaniard had an  Â£87m release clause in his contract, but Manchester City have been able to take advantage of the fact that he was in the final year of his deal and have agreed to pay around    25m up front for his services, with a further    10m in add-ons. With his signing confirmed in a statement on the club's official website, Torres said:    I am so happy to be joining City. Every player wants to be involved in attacking teams and Manchester City are one of the most attacking in world football.    Pep encourages a really open, aggressive style, which I love, and he is a manager with a proven track record of improving players. To have him overseeing my development is a dream. Here we go!

The fee was the last remaining obstacle for the Premier League club, who had already agreed personal terms with the player. It may come as somewhat of a surprise just how quickly and efficiently City were able to land the 20-year-old, but 90min learned that negotiations were straightforward as Torres made it clear he wants to follow in the footsteps of his idol David Silva.
