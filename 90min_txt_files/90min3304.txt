Liverpool are confident they have won the race for Darwin Nunez, having reached an agreement with the player over personal terms.  However, Manchester United have not given up hope of hijacking the move with agent Jorge Mendes set to hold talks with the club soon.  Liverpool hope that part of the funding for the Nunez transfer will come from Bayern Munich meeting their  Â£40m valuation of Sadio Mane.  Barcelona are considering moving for Manchester City's Bernardo Silva, but the finances of a deal will only work if the Catalan giants can offload Frenkie de Jong this summer. Silva's agent has also raised the prospect of the Blaugrana signing Rafael Leao from Milan.  Raheem Sterling could be on the move this summer. Europe's top clubs are on high alert and Chelsea are among those weighing up a bid. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is attracting interest and Manchester United could be ready to make a surprise swoop.
