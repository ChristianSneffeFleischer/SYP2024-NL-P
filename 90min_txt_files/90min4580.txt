Argentine giants Boca Juniors are interested in signing Arsenal midfielder Lucas Torreira when the summer transfer window opens.  The Uruguayan joined the Gunners from Sampdoria back in the summer of 2018, but having failed to settle in at the Emirates in the way he and the club would have hoped, he currently finds himself on loan at Atletico Madrid. The 25-year-old has struggled for game time under Diego Simeone this season, starting in La Liga on just three occasions. His current contract with the north London side runs until 2023, and given he doesn't appear to be part of Mikel Arteta's plans, he could be sold at the end of the campaign. According to Argentine journalist Diego Monroig - whose focus is the goings on at Boca - Torreira and Man Utd's Edinson Cavani are targets for the Xeneizes, who are on the lookout for a defensive midfielder and a striker. He said, as quoted by ESPN: "In normal situations Boca would not have thought of players like Torreira or Cavani, it will depend on them." Torreira has made no secret of the fact he is a Boca fan and revealed as much during an interview with ESPN Uruguay back in 2020.    This love for Boca was born many years ago," he said. "We are a very soccer family and Uruguayans consume a lot from Argentina, we watch that football a lot and I have been passionate about Boca from a very young age, I like the Boca world."
