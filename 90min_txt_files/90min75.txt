Liverpool have held talks over potentially trumping Chelsea's latest offer for Brighton midfielder Moises Caicedo, 90min understands. Chelsea have seen multiple bids for Caicedo rejected already this summer, with Brighton holding out for  £100m. While talks between the two sides remain on, Chelsea have also stepped up their pursuit of potential alternatives. Indeed, a bid was recently lodged for Southampton midfielder Romeo Lavia - the subject of three failed offers from Liverpool. With Chelsea threatening to hijack the pursuit of Lavia, sources have confirmed to 90min that Liverpool have made a late move over potentially beating Mauricio Pochettino's side to Caicedo. Sources have stressed that Liverpool have not yet submitted a formal offer for Caicedo but have held talks with Brighton as they explore a possible move to exceed Chelsea's  £80m proposal. feed 90min understands that Caicedo's preference would be to join Chelsea over Liverpool, but it remains to be seen whether that stance would change if the Reds see an offer accepted. Chelsea sources insist that the Blues remain well in the fight for Caicedo as well as Lavia, with Leeds United's Tyler Adams another target on the table. Liverpool are desperate to continue bolstering their midfield after the surprise departures of Jordan Henderson and Fabinho to Saudi Arabia, and Jurgen Klopp's side have spent a large part of the summer focused on Lavia. Three bids have been knocked back by Southampton, the latest of which was worth around  £46m, and Chelsea have moved to try and win the race for Lavia with an offer of  £48m -  £2m short of the Saints'  £50m asking price.
