Goncalo Guedes has left Wolves to return to former club Benfica on loan for the remainder of the 2022/23 season. The Portugal international only joined the Wanderers in the summer, contributing two goals in 18 appearances after impressing in five seasons with Valencia. He will swap the Premier League's relegation dog fight for a title contest in Portugal, with Benfica four points clear of closest challengers Braga. "It is an enormous happiness to return home, to the place where I grew up. I am very happy and I hope that all Benfiquistas are too. This, for me,  is very important, coming home is always very good," Guedes said. "It's an enormous happiness, I still can't describe the happiness I'm feeling. Being able to return to the club where I was born, where I did all my training, being able to be with my family, with my friends...it's a unique feeling and I want to enjoy it this moment to the fullest" On this edition of Talking Transfers, Scott Saunders hosts Toby Cudworth & Graeme Bailey to discuss all the big transfer stories.

"As soon as they spoke to me about Benfica's option, I was immediately delighted, obviously, because it is a club that would make an impact on me and to which I had already thought I wanted to return. I was  very happy, I immediately gave the endorsement that I would like to go, and then it was up to the clubs to reach an agreement. It was possible, I am very happy with that. "My ambition is to help. I'm one more to help the team, give everything, I'll try to  adapt as quickly as possible  and help the team as much as possible in its objectives."
