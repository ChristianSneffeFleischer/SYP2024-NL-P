Bayern Munich are targeting a move for Tottenham's Tanguy Ndombele as the Bavarians prepare for a mass exodus of midfielders this summer. Ndombele has endured a frustrating campaign in north London thus far as a result of fitness woes, while his supposed strained relationship with manager Jose Mourinho and lack of minutes following the Premier League's restart has thrust his future at the club into considerable doubt. Despite the Lilywhites insisting the Frenchman's not for sale this summer, Ndombele may seek to force an exit from N17 if he doesn't see his future brightening up under Mourinho.  And one of the clubs looking to pounce on the incredibly talented midfielder are Bayern, with French news outlet Le10 Sport suggesting that Die Roten's lack of funds following the purchase of Leroy Sane this summer mean they're keen on an initial loan deal for Ndombele with an option to buy. It's the sort of move they've been able to pull off in recent times, most notably with James Rodriguez and Philippe Coutinho, although it appears unlikely that Spurs will agree to such a deal. Nevertheless, with Thiago, Javi Martinez and Corentin Tolisso all potentially departing the Allianz Arena this summer, the need for midfield reinforcements is clear for Hansi Flick.  If they're unable to broker a deal for Ndombele, Chelsea's Tiemoue Bakayoko has emerged as a fall-back option.
