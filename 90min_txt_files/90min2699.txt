Ajax star Antony has admitted that he can   t rule out leaving the club this month, after Manchester United made a fresh bid to take him to Old Trafford. The 22-year-old emerged as United   s top attacking target early this summer, but Ajax   s demands of a club-record  £78m fee seemingly ruled out a move. However, United returned with a  £68m bid earlier this week - which was rejected - and the expectation in Amsterdam is that they will be back with a new offer. Now, speaking to De Telegraaf, the Brazilian has admitted that he can't promise that he will stay at Ajax this summer - with an Erik ten Hag reunion awaiting him in Manchester. "No, to be very honest I can't do that," Antony said when asked if he could promise Ajax's fans that he would stay put. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  &  Toby Cudworth  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Erik ten Hag wanting to sign five players before the transfer window closes, and Man Utd's attitude to selling Cristiano Ronaldo.

"What I can say is that I want to come to the right decision with my family, agents and Ajax, which is good for everyone. Ultimately, God determines my future." Sources have confirmed to 90min that Antony, who did not train with Ajax on Friday after United's rejected bid, wants to join up with Ten Hag, though he insisted that he loves playing for Ajax and would have no issues continuing with the club if a transfer fails to materialise.
