Chelsea have put the finishing touches on their deal to sign Christopher Nkunku at the end of the season, 90min understands. The RB Leipzig forward underwent a medical with the Blues during the summer and the two sides have spent the past few months in talks over a transfer which has now been finalised and is simply awaiting public confirmation. Chelsea had hoped to convince Leipzig to sell Nkunku in January but the Bundesliga side refused to part ways with their star forward midway through the season, while the Frenchman also suffered an injury that derailed any hopes of an earlier signing. Instead, a full agreement has been reached that will bring Nkunku to Chelsea at the end of the 2022/23 season. The 25-year-old has signed a long-term contract and his transfer has finally been sealed. Nkunku's contract with Leipzig contains a release clause worth just under  Â£60m which would have become active at the end of the season, but to beat the rush, Chelsea acted early and agreed to pay slightly over that fee in a structured deal which benefits both sides. Leipzig will receive more than Nkunku's release clause, while Chelsea have arranged a payment plan which will allow them to spread the cost out over a number of years, freeing up funds for more moves in 2023.
