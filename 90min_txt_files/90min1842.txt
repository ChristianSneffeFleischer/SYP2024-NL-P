Lyon are making a last-ditch attempt to sign Flamengo midfielder Joao Gomes, sources have told 90min. The 21-year-old is currently in England having undergone a medical ahead of a potential transfer to Wolves. However, 90min understands Flamengo have not yet signed off on the deal and are now in negotiations with Lyon. Les Gones have already agreed to match any other offer for Gomes and are attempting to thrash out personal terms, though his current preference is to play in the Premier League and he would need persuading to abandon his agreement with Wolves. Bruno Cheyrou, Lyon's chief scout, has confirmed their interest, commenting: "He is a player we have been watching for a year and a half. Before, the timing was not good. Financially, we couldn't afford it. A window has opened [with the arrival of John Textor as majority shareholder] and we are trying to rush in. I really like this player and it would be a dream to sign him." Gomes has already played 122 senior games in his professional career, scoring four goals during his time in Flamengo's first team. Julen Lopetegui has been busy adding to his new squad this transfer window, particularly in midfield. Mario Lemina joined from Nice last week, while PSG's Pablo Sarabia was unveiled as Wolves' newest player prior to Tuesday's FA Cup loss to Liverpool. 90min reported on Tuesday that despite these new additions to midfield, Wolves are not interested in selling Ruben Neves this month. Liverpool, Newcastle and Tottenham had been eyeing a move for the Portugal international, whose contract runs out in 2024.
