Manchester United are close to finalising a deal to sign Partizan Belgrade youngster Filip Stevanovic after agreeing a    12m fee - but the youngster is expected to stay where he is on loan for the 2020/21 season.  Despite his age, the 17-year-old was a key player for Partizan in 2019/20, making 35 appearances in all competitions. Two of these appearances came against United in the Europa League, with the winger coming on as a substitute in both clashes. Regarded as one of the most exciting young talents in Serbia, 90min learned in April that Man Utd, Manchester City, Chelsea and Liverpool were among the many clubs tracking the progress of Stevanovic. However, Republika now report that it is the Red Devils who have won the race for his signature after agreeing a    12m fee with Partizan.  It is claimed that Partizan have already 'sold' the winger to United and it has been agreed that Stevanovic will remain with the club for the 2020/21 season on loan.  Partizan's vice president Vladimir Vuleti   has since spoken out on the alleged agreement and while he refused to admit whether a deal has been finalised, he did reveal that the two clubs are in contact. Vuleti   briefly told Buta Sport on Friday: "Negotiations are ongoing." Partizan boss Savo Milosevic has previously suggested that the club will look for around    20m for his services, but they have now decided to cash in on Stevanovic. Equally, the player himself has pushed for the move after recognising that a club of United's size does not 'call every day'.  The Serbian has since taken to his Instagram to not-so-subtly hint that he is indeed signing for the Premier League outfit. Posting a picture of himself playing against United, Stevanovic tagged Old Trafford as his location with an eye-rolling emoji.   ??
