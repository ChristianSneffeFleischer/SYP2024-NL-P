The latest round of contract talks between Ousmane Dembele and Barcelona have broken down, leaving the Frenchman free to talk to other clubs in January. Dembele is approaching the final six months of his deal, and while Barcelona have always claimed publicly that the winger wants to renew, Dembele himself has repeatedly pushed back negotiations. Barcelona had hoped to get an answer from Dembele before January. Gerard Romero claims they've had one, but it's not the one they were hoping for. Talks are understood to have ended without a resolution, and now Dembele appears to be inching closer to the exit door at Camp Nou. AS note that Dembele and his agent have been frustrated by Barcelona's desire to cut his wages. While the winger has no problem accepting a cut to help the club's finances, he has not been impressed by the decision to commit  Â£55m and some high wages to sign Ferran Torres from Manchester City. The 24-year-old believes the money is there and his agent has been made aware of teams prepared to pay him a significantly higher salary, and that has contributed to the breakdown in talks. Barcelona are expected to look to sell Dembele in January, rather than wait for him to walk away for free.
