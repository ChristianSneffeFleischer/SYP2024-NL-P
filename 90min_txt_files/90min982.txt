Porto goalkeeper Diogo Costa has insisted he wants to stay with his current club this summer, despite interest from Manchester United. United want to sign a new stopper this summer to provide a higher level of competition for David de Gea, who is expected to sign a new contract to remain at Old Trafford for the foreseeable future. Costa has long been admired at United but 90min understands the 23-year-old is one of a handful of names on a shortlist which also includes Brentford's David Raya, among others. Asked about a possible move to Old Trafford after the Taca de Portugal final on Sunday, Costa made it clear that he is not listening to the speculation. "That's the internet," the goalkeeper said of the rumours. feed He added: "I love Porto, it   s the club of my life. I would give my life for it. My life is resolved with Porto. It is a happiness and an honour to play for my favourite club. "What they say is what they say, there is nothing concrete, I have a contract until 2027 and I hope to continue, let   s see." De Gea came under fire from United fans after his performance in the FA Cup final defeat to Manchester City, failing to keep out Ilkay Gundogan's tame winner and struggling with the ball at his feet. Manager Erik ten Hag, who has publicly admitted his wish to sign a new goalkeeper, has tried to shield De Gea from the criticism but did concede 'there are issues' with the Spaniard's style of play.
