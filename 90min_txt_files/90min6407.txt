Chelsea and Real Madrid have both reached out to the representatives of Lazio midfielder Sergej Milinkovi  -Savi   over a possible transfer this summer. Now 25, Milinkovi  -Savi   has been heavily linked with a move away from Lazio for years, but he appeared to kill talk of an exit when he signed a five-year contract at Stadio Olimpico last summer. Sporting director Igli Tare recently revealed that Lazio would not block a move if they received the right offer - which is believed to have piqued Chelsea's interest - and now La Gazzetta dello Sport have backed that up. As the story goes, Chelsea and Real have both 'started to move' on Milinkovi  -Savi  , letting him know that they would be interested in signing him this summer - despite Chelsea prioritising Kai Havertz and Real not planning to spend any money this summer. Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester United are both thought to be in the race as well, and the next few weeks are expected to be 'decisive' as Milinkovi  -Savi   figures out his next move.

Calciomercato predict the final fee will be closer to    70m. Lazio are not thought to be interested in a swap deal and only want straight cash, meaning a move to any other Italian side is seen as incredibly unlikely. This season, Milinkovi  -Savi   has managed six goals and seven assists in 35 appearances in all competitions, starting every Serie A game in which he was available to guide Lazio all the way up to second in the table.
