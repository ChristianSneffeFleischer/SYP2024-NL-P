European champions Bayern Munich are keen to add another right-back to their ranks this summer and have identified Brighton's Tariq Lamptey as a potential target.  With Thiago Alcantara's departure placing greater onus on Joshua Kimmich in midfield, Die Roten are looking to provide cover for Benjamin Pavard on the right side of defence.  The German giants were interested in signing Ajax starlet Sergi  o Dest but the Dutchman is poised to join Barcelona in a    23m deal, much to the Bavarians dismay. Norwich City's Max Aarons is another option, although German news outlet Sport1 reports that Bayern have enquired Brighton regarding the availability of Lamptey.  It's understood that the Bundesliga monopolisers would be willing to spend up to    15m to bring him to Munich, but the Seagulls are currently demanding a    25m fee for the Englishman's services.  Lamptey's current contract on the south coast runs until 2023 after signing from Chelsea in January.  The 19-year-old has since lit up the Premier League. Blessed with a remarkable change of pace and the most dynamic of dribbling abilities, Lamptey is currently one of the most entertaining players to watch in the English top-flight. After making just three senior appearances for Chelsea before his winter exit, Lamptey has since appeared 11 times for new club Brighton, particularly shining at the start of the 2020/21 campaign following Graham Potter's switch to a three at the back formation.  The 19-year-old has three assists in the Seagulls' opening three games, excelling in his wing-back role.  Lamptey would be a fantastic option for a Bayern side who you feel need to be active in the transfer market before the deadline next week if they're to maintain their domestic and continental supremacy this term.
