Nottingham Forest have announced the signing of Danilo from Palmeiras on a deal running until 2029. The Reds have been on the hunt for a 24th signing following promotion to the Premier League last summer. 90min recently reported that Forest had moved ahead of Arsenal and Monaco in the race to sign Danilo, and the East Midlands side confirmed the transfer on Monday night. Speaking to Forest's club channels, Danilo said:    I   m really happy to be fulfilling my dream of playing in the Premier League and playing for Nottingham Forest.    I learnt a bit about the history of the Club and saw they had won two European Cups. I spoke to Gustavo Scarpa as well, and he told me that Nottingham is a great city and Forest have a quality squad with really good staff.       I will show a lot of determination and a strong desire to win and will always look to do my best on the pitch to achieve positive results.    I   m excited about getting started and meeting my new teammates.
