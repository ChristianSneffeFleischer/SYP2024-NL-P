Newcastle United winger Allan Saint-Maximin is emerging as the latest Premier League star to be targeted by the Saudi Pro League, 90min understands. The Frenchman saw his game time limited last season, making just 12 Premier League starts, and is understood to be considering his options in the long-term. Although there are three years left on his current contract, Newcastle don't see a new deal beyond that as an option. 90min understands that a number of clubs have checked on his situation, including Premier League rivals Everton and Crystal Palace. Champions League semi-finalists AC Milan and French giants Marseille are also believed to have shown an interest from the continent. However, additional interest has emerged from Saudi Arabia and it could see Newcastle majority owners PIF sanctioning a move to one of the four Pro League teams they control - Al Nassr, Al Hilal, Al Ittihad and Al Ahli. feed Newcastle are looking to bolster their squad this summer and have already landed Italy international midfielder Sandro Tonali from AC Milan. But they are trying to ensure they comply with Financial Fair Play regulations, which means they need to keep one eye on their wage bill. The Magpies have limited the amount of huge salaries they pay at the top end, but their squad is too big and they hope to move on a host of names this summer. That means the likes of Matt Ritchie, Jamaal Lascelles, Martin Dubravka, Karl Darlow, Ryan Fraser, Jamal Lewis, Javi Manquillo and Jeff Hendrick could depart. In terms of bringing in a big sale, Saint-Maximin would be the most likely. It remains to be seen whether at this point of his career Saint-Maximin would be willing to leave European football, given he is only 26 years of age. He has been at Newcastle since 2019, but has returned just 12 Premier League goals in 111 appearances in the competition.
