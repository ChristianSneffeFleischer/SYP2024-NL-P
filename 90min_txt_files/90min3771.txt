New Barcelona head coach Xavi has convinced those in charge at Camp Nou to strike a deal to bring right-back Dani Alves back to the club. Now 38, Alves offered his services to his former club following his departure from Sao Paulo, but the Barcelona board were not initially convinced and rejected his offer as they wanted to focus on signing younger players. However, Xavi made it abundantly clear that he wanted Alves to help both on and off the pitch, and president Joan Laporta ultimately decided to pull a U-turn and strike a deal with the Brazilian. Fabrizio Romano says a one-year contract has been agreed and both parties are now just waiting for La Liga approval before they can finalise the deal. Alves is expected to start training with his former side next week, but Sport note he will not be able to be officially registered until the winter transfer window opens in January. Xavi does not care about the delay and wants Alves in as soon as possible. He believes the 38-year-old can offer some real experience to the young players in the squad, while also helping convey his message of what it means to play for Barcelona. For Alves, it's a return to the club he left back in 2016 and a chance to add to the 391 appearances he made for the Blaugrana.
