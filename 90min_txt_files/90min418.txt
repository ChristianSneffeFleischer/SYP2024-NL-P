Aston Villa have announced the signing of Pau Torres from Villarreal. The centre-back will reunite with Unai Emery in the West Midlands having won the Europa League together with the Yellow Submarine back in 2021. The transfer is subject to international clearance and a successful visa application. Villa have been on the hunt for squad reinforcements after securing an unlikely spot in next season's Conference League. They have now confirmed Torres as their second signing of the summer, following on from Youri Tielemans' free transfer from Leicester City. feed 90min first reported at the start of June that Torres was of interest to Villa, as well as Manchester City's Aymeric Laporte. Negotiations advanced throughout the following weeks and an agreement was reached on the final day of the month, with the Spain international granted permission to travel for a medical. Torres' move was confirmed on Wednesday after returning from his honeymoon. Villa have further plans to bring in a winger this window, but have failed in their attempts to sign Nico Williams from Athletic Club and are struggling to persuade Ferran Torres to leave Barcelona.
