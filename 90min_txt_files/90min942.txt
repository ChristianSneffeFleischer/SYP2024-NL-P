Luis Suarez is set to join Inter Miami alongside former Barcelona teammates Lionel Messi and Sergio Busquets, sources have confirmed to 90min. 90min confirmed on Wednesday that Lionel Messi would be joining Inter Miami this summer, where he would be joined by close friend Sergio Busquets. Now 90min can also confirm that veteran Uruguay star Suarez, who was very close with Messi at Camp Nou, will also be joining the Major League Soccer outfit going through a huge revamp. Messi is arriving on a free transfer after he ran down his contract at Paris Saint-Germain, and likewise Busquets comes in for nothing after leaving Barcelona at the end of the 2022/23 European season. Suarez has been with Brazilian side Gremio since last year following a stint in his homeland with Nacional. The 36-year-old is contracted to Gremio until 2024, but he has a release clause which he and Miami have activated and his signing will soon be confirmed. Suarez's arrival in south Florida will mean he returns to the same squad as Messi and Busquets for the first time since 2020, when he left Camp Nou for Atletico Madrid.
