Juventus are said to have 'opened talks' with Donny van de Beek's agent over a possible January transfer, with the midfielder continuing to endure a frustrating time at Manchester United.  Van de Beek has failed to nail down a regular starting spot since arriving at Old Trafford from Ajax at the beginning of last season. During his maiden campaign he made just 19 Premier League appearances, the vast majority of which came from the bench.  His struggles have continued this season with the Dutchman enjoying just a few minutes of playing time in the Premier League so far. That led to the 24-year-old recently letting his frustrations boil over, reacting angrily on the substitutes bench as he was again overlooked by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in a Champions League game against Villarreal.  He was linked with a move away from the club in the summer and the rumour mill has not stopped spinning with newly-monied Newcastle United among those recently linked. But over in Italy, La Stampa (via Football Italia) state that Juventus are also in the race, claiming the Serie A giants are currently in dialogue with the player's agent regarding a January switch. Van de Beek's close friendship with former Ajax teammate Matthijs de Ligt is mentioned as a possible reason why Juve's pursuit could be successful, while their desire to strengthen in midfield is no secret, even if they did sign Manuel Locatelli from Sassuolo in the summer.
