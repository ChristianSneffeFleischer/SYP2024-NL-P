Chelsea consider talented young centre-back Levi Colwill unsellable despite interest from Brighton and Hove Albion, 90min understands. Colwill was one of the breakout starlets of the 2022/23 Premier League season, putting in eye-catching performances while out on loan at Brighton. The 20-year-old became a regular at the AMEX Stadium following Roberto De Zerbi's appointment as manager and was key in the club's qualification for next season's UEFA Europa League.  As expected, Brighton are now keen to sign the defender on a permanent deal, with Sky Sports reporting that the club lodged a  Â£30m for the player's services. Sources have confirmed to 90min however that Colwill's parent club Chelsea consider the defender to be unsellable and are keen to see how he performs in pre-season under new manager Mauricio Pochettino. feed After a pre-season assessment there does remain the possibility that Colwill will be sent out on loan for another campaign, but there is no scope for a permanent departure. Chelsea are keen to sell 12-14 first-team players during the upcoming summer transfer window. 90min understands one player set to leave is Mason Mount, who has agreed personal terms with Manchester United ahead of a move. Mount has been heavily linked with a number of different clubs in recent weeks - including Liverpool and Arsenal - due to the Blues' difficulty in tying the midfielder down to a long-term deal at Stamford Bridge.
