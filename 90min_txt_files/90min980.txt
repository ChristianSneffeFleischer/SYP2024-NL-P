Barcelona manager Xavi is expecting the club to make significant moves behind the scenes 'this week' as they look to finalise their plan for the summer transfer window. The Spanish champions have submitted plans, including for the possible re-signing of Camp Nou legend Lionel Messi, to La Liga and are awaiting approval. 90min understands a final decision from league officials is expected imminently. Currently, Barcelona have been banned from registering new players after exceeding their salary cap but a 'viability plan' has been put to La Liga in the hope of proving their ability to get spending back under control - a cause which has been aided by the departures of Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba. Xavi is expecting some positive moves in the coming days and, after Sunday's surprise defeat to Celta Vigo to finish the season, confirmed the club will finalise their plans soon. "We have had a great season. We have to reinforce ourselves to fight for all the titles and compete especially in Europe. There we must take a step forward and we need two players per position. But we have gotten a lot out of this squad," he said. feed "This week is already decisive to know the real scenario that we can sign and strengthen ourselves, we must strengthen ourselves to compete in Europe. The definitive step to be competitive in all the titles is to strengthen yourself well." Barcelona are expected to offload further members of their first team and Xavi admitted decisions on a number of fringe players will also be made in the coming days. "I don   t know if it was the last game for some players, it will depend this week, which will be decisive," he continued. "We are on    standby   , but it will be a key week to find out what stage we are in."
