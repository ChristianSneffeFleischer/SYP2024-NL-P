Fulham have rejected a fresh approach from Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal for star striker Aleksandar Mitrovic, sources have told 90min. The Serbia international solidified his place as one of the Premier League's leading forwards last season, scoring 14 goals in 24 games following the Whites' promotion back to the top flight and finishing above rivals Chelsea in the table. Mitrovic has become a cult figure at Fulham during his six seasons in west London, but his future is uncertain amid interest from Saudi Arabia. 90min reported earlier this week that he and manager Marco Silva are being targeted by the Saudi Pro League, with Fulham already rejecting a  £25m offer from Al Hilal for Mitrovic. feed Sources have now confirmed to 90min that Al Hilal returned with a new bid of nearly  £30m, but this was again quickly knocked back by Fulham. Mitrovic is believed to be open to a move to Saudi Arabia and would like to at least have the chance to explore such a transfer, but Fulham are standing firm and at this stage do not have any plans to sell him. Al Hilal recently completed the signing of Mitrovic's compatriot and close friend Sergej Milinikovic-Savic from Lazio. They have also brought in Ruben Neves from Wolves and Kalidou Koulibaly from Chelsea. Meanwhile, 90min understands Fulham are looking to beat a number of Europe's top sides to the signature of 21-year-old Brazil midfielder Andre Trindade.
