Ousmane Dembele has warned Paris Saint-Germain that he has no interest in leaving Barcelona in the near future. PSG were among the sides chasing Dembele as his previous contract wound down towards the end of last season and the Ligue 1 leaders have been tipped to lodge a bid for the 25-year-old as he enters the final 18 months of his current deal. Asked for his feelings towards an imminent move to PSG, Dembele made it abundantly clear that his focus is solely on Barcelona.    Four months ago, I signed a new contract with FC Barcelona,    he told Eleven Sports. "I'm happy here. We will continue to work with Bar  a. "Does Paris interest me? No, I'm fine in Barcelona. There's a good living environment. I'm also fine with the coach. I have the confidence of the coach but also of the leaders of the club. When you have that confidence...I feel good and happy."
