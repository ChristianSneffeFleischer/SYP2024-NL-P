Barcelona's pursuit of Manchester City defender Eric Garcia could lead to a swap deal involving forgotten midfielder Rafinha. The Catalan giants are known admirers of Garcia, who was on Barcelona's academy books for nine years and has just one year remaining on his City contract. The 19-year-old has already turned down the chance to extend his contract at the Etihad, meaning he'll be free to negotiate a move away from the club in January. Although the club will not be able to command a transfer fee, City would be entitled to compensation of some sort - because of his age - if he does decide to run his contract down. Barcelona would prefer to get a deal over the line for Garcia now, as they look to rebuild and revamp a squad that needs a complete overhaul to compete for Champions League honours, and Mundo Deportivo claim that Bar  a could offer Rafinha to City in order to push through a move. Rafinha is the younger brother of new Liverpool recruit Thiago, and has largely been on the periphery throughout his time at Barcelona. He's spent time on loan at Inter and Celta over the past couple of seasons, and doesn't feature in the plans of new head coach Ronald Koeman. The 27-year-old is understood to have a market value of around    16m, but Barcelona will still need to include a nominal amount of cash if they are to persuade City into letting Garcia go now. That's despite Pep Guardiola bringing in Ruben Dias from Benfica for  Â£62m, to complement the signing of Nathan Ak   earlier in the transfer window.
