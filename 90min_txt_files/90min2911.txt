Brendan Rodgers has warned Newcastle that their  £40m bid for playmaker James Maddison wouldn't even be enough to buy one of the Englishman's legs. With Leicester looking to trim their squad to abide by Financial Fair Play rules, Newcastle tried to take advantage with a  £40m bid for Maddison's services, but the Foxes rebuffed their advance almost immediately and offered no encouragement that a deal would be done. When asked about Newcastle's approach for Maddison, Rodgers could hardly hide his laughter. "He   s still very much a player here," Rodgers said. "Naturally the players are sought after because they are talents. "You see his performance, you see how happy he is and he   s not a player we want to sell. It   s not for me to put valuations on the players, it   s not my side, but that might just cover three-quarters of his left leg, that price. He   s a top player."
