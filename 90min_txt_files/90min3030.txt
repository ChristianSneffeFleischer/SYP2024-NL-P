Thomas Tuchel does not 'expect' Armando Broja to leave Chelsea this summer, despite strong interest from West Ham.  Broja impressed on loan at Southampton last season, featuring in all but six of Saints' Premier League games and scoring six goals.  As reported by 90min, there has been significant interest in the 20-year-old's services this summer. Everton, Newcastle and Southampton had all been keen, but West Ham have now moved into pole position.  However, Tuchel has insisted that he does not envisage Broja - who recently had to depart the Blues' US tour due to injury - leaving the club during the current transfer window.  "I don   t expect him to leave," Tuchel said. "We are aware of interest and offers, which just tells us there is a lot of potential, and the owners and me will take this decision together in the end, also with the player. "Right now when he arrived, it   s clear he   s trying to impress and is just trying to become a Chelsea player as soon as possible. After his loan at Southampton, the situation was very clear for him to make the next step, to show his improvement and make an impression in pre-season. "Unfortunately he injured himself and of course there is a lot of noise going on because there are offers and interest in him. Let   s see how this goes but I   m pretty calm about it because we know the situation and we have a contract."
