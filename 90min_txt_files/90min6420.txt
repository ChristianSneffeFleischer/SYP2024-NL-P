Juventus boss Maurizio Sarri has identified AS Roma striker Edin Dzeko as a top priority for the summer transfer window, as the Italian coach looks to line up a replacement for the potentially outgoing Gonzalo Higuain.  I Giallorossi are prepared to offload the Bosnian hitman this summer, as the club has been severely hit by the coronavirus crisis, and are in dire need of the cash. And Dzeko, who is on a contract worth  Â£6.6m a year, could be one of the major casualties as Roma look to cut their costs.  According to Tuttosport, Juve are prepared to take advantage of their Serie A rival's troubles, and Sarri is excited by the prospect of adding Dzeko to their ranks, as the ex-Chelsea coach has been a long-standing admirer of the forward.  The 34-year-old extended his contract with the capital city club at the start of the 2019/20 season, and his new deal is set to run until the summer of 2022. Dzeko has been a star performer in a struggling Roma side this season, bagging 14 goals in 28 appearances.  His impressive strike rate will seemingly not be enough to secure Champions League qualification for I Giallorossi next season, and subsequently the club may not be able to afford his wages for the following two years.
