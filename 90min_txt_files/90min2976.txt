Troy Parrott has joined Preston North End on loan for the 2022/23 season, signing a contract extension at Tottenham Hotspur before making the move.  The 20-year-old forward has long been touted as one of the most talented young players at the Lilywhites, with 90min sources previously confirming that the club's backroom staff believe that he can become the 'new Harry Kane'.  Parrott's development is taking a similar path to Kane's, enjoying loan spells at a number of clubs in recent years. The forward's next loan move is to Preston in the Championship where he will join up with fellow Republic of Ireland internationals Alan Browne, Robbie Brady and Sean Maguire.  The forward has signed a new Tottenham deal which runs until 2025 before making the loan move.
