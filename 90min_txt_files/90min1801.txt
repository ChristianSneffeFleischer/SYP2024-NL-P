Sporting CP wing-back Pedro Porro and head coach Ruben Amorim have both been asked about Tottenham's ongoing pursuit to sign the former before the end of the January transfer window. 90min first reported of Spurs' interest in Porro in December, and while Sporting have repeatedly insisted that a transfer will only be sanctioned if his    45m release clause is met up front, some behind the scenes have been tempted by an offer in instalments. Porro continued his fine season with a goal and assist in their late 2-1 win at home to Vizela on Friday night, and speaking to the press post-match, he remained tight-lipped about his future. On this edition of Oh What a Night, Sean Walsh and Jude Summerfield discuss Tottenham's derby loss to Arsenal, the futures of Harry Kane and Antonio Conte and more.

"I   m focused on Sporting and I'm happy here."
