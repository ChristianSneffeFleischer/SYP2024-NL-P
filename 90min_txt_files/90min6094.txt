Everton manager Carlo Ancelotti is considering launching a bid for Manchester United right-back Diogo Dalot this summer. The 21-year-old was an expensive arrival from Porto in the summer of 2018 but managed just four Premier League appearances this season, with a combination of injuries and the form of Aaron Wan-Bissaka keeping Dalot on the sidelines. With United planning a hectic summer transfer window, The Mirror suggest that Dalot could be one of several players sold to raise money, and Everton may be ready to take advantage of that with a cut-price bid. Ancelotti has no plans to offload current right-back Seamus Coleman just yet, but with the Irishman now 31 years old, plans are being made for the future and the boss sees Dalot as the ideal candidate to replace him down the line. Dalot's versatility also works in his favour. He is comfortable playing on the left of defence and could therefore replace Leighton Baines, who retired at the end of the campaign. While United spent  £19m to bring Dalot to Old Trafford two years ago, the Toffees believe he could cost closer to the  £10m mark now after failing to make the predicted impact at the club, although United will likely be determined to negotiate a higher price as he still has three years left on his contract. It is thought that Dalot might be interested in the move as he understands displacing 22-year-old Wan-Bissaka, who arrived for  £50m just last summer, will likely be a tough task, whereas he would have a better chance of cementing a spot at Goodison Park. There has also been talk of an unlikely move to Barcelona, but if Dalot wants to find a club who can offer him regular first-team minutes, heading to Camp Nou might not be the best move.
