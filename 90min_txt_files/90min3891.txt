Arsenal are closing in on the signing of Bologna defender Takehiro Tomiyasu, with an announcement due after the completion of a medical. The 22-year-old was a near ever-present for the Serie A side last season, missing just six league games. A versatile operator, Tomiyasu split his time between right-back and centre-back fairly evenly last term.   News of his imminent arrival, as reported by Fabrizio Romano, is somewhat surprising considering how well-stocked Arsenal already are in defence. Saying that, they are set to lose at least one right-back before the transfer deadline with Hector Bellerin agreeing a move to Real Betis. Ainsley Maitland-Niles, who can also play in midfield, is also agitating for a move away. Everton have tabled a season-long loan offer for the player with an option to buy but Arsenal are yet to respond.   Their slowness has frustrated Maitland-Niles with the player taking to Instagram to voice his displeasure over the weekend. He still intends to push for a move and has set up a meeting with Mikel Arteta to discuss the situation.   Tomiyasu   s imminent arrival makes Maitland-Niles    exit more likely. Arsenal are said to be paying    20m ( £17.2m) plus    3m ( £2.6m) in add-ons for his services and he will soon become their sixth signing of the summer.     The Gunners were always planning to spend big, earmarking a spend of around  £250m at the start of the transfer window. Since then Ben White has arrived from Brighton for over  £50m, while Martin Odegaard has joined permanently from Real Madrid after a loan spell last season.
