Inter are working on a deal to re-sign Romelu Lukaku on another loan from Chelsea next season, sources have confirmed to 90min. Lukaku returned to Inter last summer on a season-long loan after just one year back at Chelsea, but the 29-year-old has endured a troubled campaign blighted by injuries and has only just returned to full fitness. Sources have told 90min that Inter would like to re-sign Lukaku on loan next season, though not for the same financial commitment as their current arrangement. The striker and Chelsea have already discussed extending his spell at San Siro. 90min understands that Lukaku is willing to defer some of his wages in order to remain at Inter, while Chelsea currently have no plans to bring the Belgian back to the club this summer. Inter believe they are in a strong negotiating position for these reasons. READ NEXT manual When discussing Lukaku's future, Inter CEO Beppe Marrotta recently told Sky Sport Italia: "The loan was for one season so on June 30 regardless of how well he plays, he   ll go back to Chelsea. "This has been an unprecedented season. I   m referring of course to the [winter] World Cup. The problems we   ve experienced have been experienced by other clubs too and the players who played at the World Cup. "Lukaku is a case in point. [Marcelo] Brozovic isn   t the Brozovic we know. Lukaku hasn   t found the fitness he needs to play his best football. He   s still not at his best or the player we got to see in years gone by." LISTEN NOW
