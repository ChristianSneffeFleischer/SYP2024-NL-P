Manchester United have been linked with Leicester defender Wesley Fofana as part of the club   s ongoing search for a new centre-back. Fofana only joined Leicester last summer in a  £36.5m deal from Saint-Etienne, but the 20-year-old has enjoyed an impressive debut season in the Premier League. Since making his debut back in October, Fofana has started every Premier League game when fit, aside from one substitute appearance when he came back from a recent thigh problem.  United are in the market for a centre-back this summer as they try to secure a long-term partner for Harry Maguire. Jules Kounde and Pau Torres have been the primary targets up to now, but there has been a longer shortlist and top clubs will stay alert when it comes to recruitment. It is French outlet Foot Mercato that claims there are eyes from Old Trafford on Fofana. There are also said to be other English clubs taking an interest, although they remain un-named in the report. However, the problem for any potential suitor would be what fee Leicester demand. Because of his age, long-term potential and lengthy contract until 2025, the Foxes are in a very strong position and would value Fofana at the same price at which they sold Maguire to United 2019. That potentially means an  £80m valuation on Fofana, which is likely to be prohibitive in the current financial climate. That figure is more than either Kounde ( £68m) or Torres ( £52m) would cost, while Raphael Varane has also been valued at an estimated  £60m.
