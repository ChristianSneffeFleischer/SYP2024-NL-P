Naby Keita is fielding offers from around Europe with his Liverpool contract due to expire in the summer, and as yet talks not advanced over a new deal, sources have confirmed to 90min. Keita told Liverpool as early as last summer that he was contemplating his future amid concerns that they had not offered him a new deal at that point. 90min understands he was also concerned by missing out on a starting spot in the Champions League final against Real Madrid, despite showing some of the best form of his career at the end of last season. Jurgen Klopp remains a big fan of the Keita and has told Liverpool's hierarchy not to rule out handing him fresh terms, but a lack of first-team guarantees remains an issue. 90min revealed in October that a number of Premier League clubs were keeping tabs on him, and it is understood that Tottenham are among those who are still considering a contract offer. Keita has options elsewhere, with Ligue 1 sides Lyon and Monaco believed to have expressed an interest. In Italy, Milan and Inter are fans of the player, and the prospect of landing him on a free is more than tempting. However, 90min understands that the chance to move back to RB Leipzig is a huge consideration for Keita. He remains a hugely popular figure in the Bundesliga and there are a number of sides interested, but a return to Leipzig is seen as the most likely at this point.
