Torino midfielder Sasa Lukic is undergoing a medical ahead of a move to Fulham, 90min understands, but the Cottagers will have to fend off interest from Newcastle if they are to sign Sheffield United's Sander Berge. Bolstering in midfield has been key to Marco Silva's January plans and a fee of    8m has been agreed for 26-year-old Serbia international Lukic, whose move is expected to go through without concern before the closure of the transfer window. Fulham are not finished there, however, and hope to see Berge follow Lukic through the entrance door at Craven Cottage. As reported by 90min on Sunday, Fulham have made contact with Sheffield United over Berge and hope to take advantage of his expiring contract - Berge's deal has 18 months left to run - and the club's transfer embargo to strike a deal for the Norway midfielder. Fulham are believed to have offered around  Â£25m in cash for Berge's services, and the Cottagers are hopeful that will be enough to trump interest from Newcastle.

Newcastle are exploring a loan deal for Berge which would see them make his move permanent at the end of the summer, and Eddie Howe's high fliers are prepared to exceed Fulham's bid with a summer transfer. The issue for Sheffield United is their transfer embargo, which was issued by the EFL after they missed a payment to another club over an unnamed player signing.
