Manchester United have signed young central defender Willy Kambwala from French side Sochaux for a fee thought to be in the region of    4m. The 16-year-old has signed a four-year deal with the Premier League outfit and will join their Under-18s squad, though he needs to complete a mandatory period of self-isolation first. A statement on United's website reads: "Manchester United is pleased to confirm the signing of Willy Kambwala from Sochaux.  @mih.management @mikeleemadeit @tshimen @nskl.design A post shared by  Willy Kambwala??

"Kambwala will join Neil Ryan   s Under-18s squad once his mandatory period of self-isolation is complete." The deal is worth    4m with bonuses, with a sell-on fee clause also included. Premier League champions Liverpool were previously linked with the teenager. Regarding their senior set-up, United have been pretty slow to act in the transfer market. Donny van de Beek, who joined from Dutch giants Ajax, became their first signing of the window back in September, and the deal for Porto full back Alex Telles was only confirmed on Monday.
