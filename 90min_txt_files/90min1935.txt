Mateusz Klich has arrived in the United States with 90min sources confirming his move to D.C. United is set to be confirmed in the next 24 hours. The Polish midfielder has been linked with a move from Leeds United for some time and although multiple clubs from across top European leagues showed an interest, it is D.C. United of MLS that won the race for his signature. Klich posted an image on his Instagram story where he appears to be having coffee and watching Leeds United's FA Cup tie with Cardiff City on Sunday, tagging his location in Arlington, Virginia, which is just across the Potomac River from D.C. United's Audi Field stadium. Mateusz Klich is in Arlington, Virginia     His move to DC United has been agreed and he's arrived to finalize. Leeds United have terminated his deal.                pic.twitter.com/9kP5ERTNoT A source has informed 90min that Leeds have already terminated Klich's deal, with the Poland international now set to sign a multi-year contract with D.C., joining the four-time MLS Cup champions on a four-year deal as a Designated Player. The club is expected to announce the transfer within the next 24 hours. Prior to joining Leeds, Klich enjoyed a career across Europe with the likes of Cracovia in Poland, Wolfsburg and Kaiserslautern in Germany, and PEC Zwolle and FC Twente in the Netherlands. However, it was at Elland Road that the 32-year-old had his best spell, making 195 appearances across all competitions in a five-and-a-half-year spell that saw him score 24 goals, provide 21 assists, and help Leeds achieve promotion back to the Premier League. Klich has made 16 appearances for the Whites this season, and his departure clearly hasn't sat well with head coach Jesse Marsch, who has been public in his desire to keep the midfielder.
