Leicester City are in talks with RB Leipzig over a deal to sign English winger Ademola Lookman on a season-long loan. The 23-year-old has struggled to hold down a starting spot at Leipzig and spent last season out on loan with Fulham, where his four goals and four assists in 34 appearances were not enough to save the Cottagers from relegation. Lookman is now looking for a new home and The Athletic state that Leicester are hopeful of bringing him to the King Power Stadium on a season-long loan with an option to buy. The former Everton winger is keen to link up with Brendan Rodgers' side for the remainder of the season, so it is now up to the two teams to agree on the finances of the loan and any potential future transfer. There is still work to do to get to that point, however, with Leipzig reluctant to lose Lookman for cheap. Leicester are also working on potential outgoings from the club, with Belgian midfielder Dennis Praet inching closer to a loan move to Serie A side Torino. According to The Telegraph, Praet is due to undergo a medical in Turin on Monday ahead of a season-long switch, although the deal could be made permanent should things go well. Praet has never really reached his full potential since arriving at Leicester from Torino's Serie A rivals Sampdoria in the summer of 2019, struggling both with form and niggling fitness issues.
