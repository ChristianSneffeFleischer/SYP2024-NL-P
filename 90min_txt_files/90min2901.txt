Barcelona president Joan Laporta has revealed the deadline by which Barcelona must register their hoard of new players, putting pressure on Manchester United to conclude a transfer for Frenkie de Jong. Despite the financial uncertainty surrounding the club, Barcelona have spent lavishly this summer on the likes of Robert Lewandowski, Jules Kounde and Raphinha, while Andreas Christensen and Franck Kessie have also arrived on free transfers. However, none of those new signings have been registered with La Liga yet ahead of the new season, with Bar  a hoping De Jong's sale to United will balance the books and smoothen that process. Speaking at Kounde's unveiling as a Barcelona player, Laporta revealed that the club was working hard to register their new arrivals within the next fortnight. "We are doing everything possible to register the signings," he said. "We have to do it before 13 August." The club president claimed he was 'optimistic' they would get it done and added: "Let's hope that the league sees it that way too."
