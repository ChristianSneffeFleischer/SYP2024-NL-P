Bayern Munich CEO Oliver Kahn has revealed the club have no plans to sign another striker following Robert Lewandowski's departure. The Poland international signed for Barcelona for a fee that could reach    50m earlier this month, bringing an end to his eight-year stay in Bavaria. The Bundesliga champions managed to bring in Sadio Mane from Liverpool prior to Lewandowski's exit and head coach Julian Nagelsmann has since revealed he sees the Senegal star as a centre forward. Nagelsmann has admitted he is an admirer of Harry Kane amid talk that he is a transfer target for next summer - a matter which has annoyed Tottenham boss Antonio Conte - and Kahn has said another number nine will not walk through the Allianz Arena doors this window. Listen now to 90min's Talking Transfers podcast, with  Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey,  Harry Symeou  &  Toby Cudworth.
