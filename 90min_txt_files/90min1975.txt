A host of Premier League clubs are battling to sign Spanish starlet Ivan Fresneda this month, 90min understands. The 18-year-old Real Valladolid right-back has emerged as one of Europe   s top defensive prospects having only made his league debut at the start of September. Fresneda has had scouts from almost every major club in Europe check on him in the last few months and Valladolid are now ready to sell. It is believed they will do business at    20m. 90min understands that Newcastle United are targeting the signing of a new right-back to provide back-up for Kieran Trippier and that they have held talks over a potential deal - although there is no agreement as it stands. The Magpies are, however, not the only club interested in signing Fresneda. Real Madrid, who had Fresneda in their youth system as a young teenager before he left for Leganes and then Valladolid, have been following him along with city rivals Atletico Madrid, while Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund and Juventus have also watched him closely. In terms of Premier League interest, 90min understands that Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur have also watched the player and are considering making approaches of their own.
