Napoli president Aurelio De Laurentiis says a new two-year contract was agreed with Victor Osimhen before the Scudetto celebrations but opened the door for a summer departure should an "indispensable" offer come in for the striker. The Nigerian forward is one of the summer transfer window's most eyed players after bagging 26 goals in Serie A to win the Capocannoniere trophy and deliver Napoli's first league title since 1990. Chelsea made the 24-year-old their top striker target for the year earlier in 2023, while 90min understands he is also on Manchester United's radar. Osimhen previously said he will "just go with the flow" with regards to his immediate future and De Laurentiis has now opened the door for other players to also leave. He said: "I have said for a while that Osimhen has to stay. Then, if an offer came in that I could not refuse for the good of Napoli, then we would consider it, as is only natural. feed "We already talked to Osimhen before the Scudetto celebrations, so we already have a basic agreement on a two-year extension of his contract. The other players, that is something we need to study with Rudi [Garcia], because I have for many years been convinced that pre-season training is fundamental. "We refused to play the Gamper Trophy with Barcelona, refused to play Manchester United, because we want to remain together and bring international teams to Castel di Sangro, so we avoid too much travelling." One player also potentially on the move is star defender Kim Min-jae. The South Korean centre back recently turned down a new contract in Naples and 90min understands Bayern Munich are now in talks with his representatives as they prepare to trigger his    50m release clause.
