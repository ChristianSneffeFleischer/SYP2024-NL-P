Crystal Palace have joined Leeds United in showing their interest in Manchester United and Wales winger Daniel James. Leeds were linked with James over the weekend and wish to take him on loan, but now face competition from Palace, who are still looking to bolster their attack and bring down the average age of their squad. Sky Sports reported over the weekend that the Whites had made a loan offer to United for James, while the Daily Mail now report that Palace are also interested in his services. But the Welshman has no desire to leave Old Trafford and instead wishes to fight for his place. James featured against Palace in United's season opening 3-1 defeat, but failed to leave his mark on the game once again. The 22-year-old has struggled for form in 2020 and subsequently lost his place in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's usual starting lineup to Mason Greenwood. Sky Sports state that United's situation regarding James could still change depending on their pursuit of Jadon Sancho, who remains the Red Devils' priority transfer target despite Borussia Dortmund not budging from their  Â£108m asking price. United are expected to make another offer for the England international imminently.
