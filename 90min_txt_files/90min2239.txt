Chelsea were one of the more prominent suitors for Cristiano Ronaldo during the summer as co-owner Todd Boehly met the Portugal international's agent, Jorge Mendes, to discuss a possible transfer. While Boehly was open to pursuing Ronaldo, then-Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel was not as keen and the decision was made to abandon their interest, with the Blues ultimately bringing in Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang from Barcelona instead. However, with Ronaldo now a free agent following his departure from Manchester United and Graham Potter now in the dugout at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea have once again been named as potential suitors. 90min understands that Boehly is yet to rule out pursuing Ronaldo, whose performances at the World Cup are being watched incredibly carefully by the American. Harry Symeou hosts Scott Saunders, Grizz Khan and Jack Gallagher to look back on France '98 as part of the 'Our World Cup' series. We take a trip down memory lane - join us!
