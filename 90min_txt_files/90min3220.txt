Mohamed Salah has vowed to deliver more trophies to Liverpool after signing a new contract at the club. The 30-year-old has put pen to paper on a three-year contract which 90min understands includes the option to extend for a further 12 months, with Salah agreeing to become the club's highest-ever earner. With his future now settled, Salah has his sights set on more accolades.    If I look back to that time when I came [here], the club were not winning many things but I think I told you I had come [here] to win trophies," he said.    I think we have won good trophies together [since]! And I think we can do it again. We won so many things together. We had some disappointments, but this is football.    I have enjoyed my football here at the club and hopefully I will continue to enjoy it and win many trophies.

The Egyptian sits ninth on the club's all-time scoring charts and should climb a few places higher over this coming season if he continues finding the back of the net at his recent rate.    It's great to see yourself as the ninth-highest top goalscorer for the club, especially when you do it in a short time," he added.
