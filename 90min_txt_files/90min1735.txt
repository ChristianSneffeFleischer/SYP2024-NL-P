Marco Reus is continuing talks with Borussia Dortmund, but his agent is assessing possible options in Europe, 90min understands. Reus is a Dortmund legend having spent over a decade with the club after arriving from Borussia Monchengladbach in 2012. The 33-year-old's current deal is due to expire in the summer and talks are ongoing with Dortmund about an extension, although his agent is also talking with other clubs about a potential summer deal - one of which is understood to be Manchester United. Cristiano Ronaldo's Al Nassr have also show an interest, but Dortmund's sporting director Sebastian Kehl remains confident he will stay. "We are in trusting talks with the player and the agent, " Kehl told Sky Germany this week. "There is nothing more to say about it at the moment. We don't let ourselves be carried away either. We know each other very, very well and have a good relationship of trust.
