American defender Chris Richards is in London having a medical ahead of a move to Crystal Palace which could be announced as early as this weekend, 90min understands. The 22-year-old has attracted interest from across Europe's top five leagues this summer, with sources close to the player telling 90min his main focus has been finding a club where he can play regularly to win his spot on the USMNT's World Cup roster. Leeds United, Southampton, and Brighton were among the Premier League outfits linked with a move for Richards, but it's Palace who have won the race.

Earlier this week, former Bayern sporting director Hasan Salihamidzic confirmed to Bild:    We   re holding talks.     Sources later confirmed that while talks were progressing well, reports suggesting personal terms were agreed were a little premature. However, 90min now understands Richards arrived in London last night to undergo a medical. Palace will pay  £10m ($12.2m) to Bayern for Richards, who will sign a five-year contract, with another  £6.8m ($8.1m) payable to the Bundesliga champions in add-ons. MLS club FC Dallas expect to receive 35% of that fee as a sell-on clause. Sources say the transfer could be announced as early as this weekend, though Monday seems more likely. Richards has been with Bayern Munich since 2018 following a successful trial period having previously developed in the  FC Dallas  youth system - also responsible for talents such as Weston McKennie, Ricardo Pepi, Reggie Cannon, and Justin Che.
