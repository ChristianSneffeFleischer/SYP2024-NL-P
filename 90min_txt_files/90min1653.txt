He joins on an initial loan deal which includes an obligation to buy. Enzo Fernandez will sign an EIGHT-AND-A-HALF-YEAR contract at Chelsea, 90min understands, to tie him to the club until 2031. Graeme Bailey, 90min's transfer correspondent: "Behdad Eghbali has taken control of this deal - original record deal was agreed with Benfica on Monday, but instalments not right. Eghbali had to almost start again and now instalment plan has been confirmed - at  £105m, but first instalment is bigger. British record deal done!" Bournemouth have finalised the signing of Ivorian midfielder Hamed Traore from Serie A side Sassuolo. The 22-year-old joins Ukrainian centre-back Illia Zabarnyi through the Vitality Stadium arrivals door, and is the Cherries' sixth signing of the winter window.                                                            s £o as tuas cores        Bem-vindo, @HectorBellerin        #EuSouSporting Hector Bellerin's Barcelona return has ended up being rather short and sweet, with a move to Sporting CP now finalised.

He'll spend the remainder of the 2022/23 season in the Spanish capital. Watford have turned down an approach from Everton for winger Ismaila Sarr, 90min understands, which was a loan bid with an obligation to buy at  £30m if the Toffees stay up. Sean Dyche really needs reinforcements but there's still nothing do on Merseyside. Nottingham Forest have completed the signing of Brazilian centeal defender Felipe from Atl  tico Madrid. He has put pen to paper on an 18-month contract and becomes Forest's 476th* signing of what's been a crazy 2022/23 season. *may not be 100% accurate Everton's efforts to strengthen Sean Dyche's goalscoring options are not panning out as planned, and their could even be bad news in their bid to sign free agent Andre Ayew. 90min understands that the 33-year-old's wage demands are proving to be a stumbling block, even though he is without a club after leaving Al Sadd, and he might not even get a work permit. No pressure to get this one wrapped by 11pm as Ayew is not transferring from another club, but yikes...

Welcome to The Arsenal, Jorginho      pic.twitter.com/jHXqAUBKKQ It's a done deal for Premier League leaders Arsenal and a huge boost for Mikel Arteta and the depth of his midfield. 31-year-old Jorginho, who made 143 appearances for Chelsea, has signed an 18-month contract at the Emirates Stadium with the option of a further year, having lifted the Champions League, Europa League, Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup while in west London. "We are so pleased to sign Jorginho and welcome him and his family to the club,    was Arteta's reaction to his new signing. Juventus full-back Luca Pellegrini has been on loan at Eintracht Frankfurt for the first half of the season, but he's heading back to Italy after seeing that stint cut short. But instead of heading back to Turin, Pellegrini is now off to Lazio for another loan spell - one which may turn into a permanent move if things go well. Ladies and gentlemen, he   s here and he   s      and       #AnnounceThorgan pic.twitter.com/X021j7JsJ6 Eden Hazard is continuing to plug away at Real Madrid, but it's pastures new for his brother Thorgan this January.

A bit boost for Marco Silva's Cottagers. Nottingham Forest's sensational season of signings looks to have gone to another level of crazy, with a loan deal close for Paris Saint-Germain's backup goalkeeper Keylor Navas. The Costa Rican, who counts Real Madrid among his former clubs, is on the verge of joining until the end of the season, and should step into the side immediately because of an injury to Dean Henderson. In terms of an outgoing, Lewis O'Brien looks to be heading to Blackburn Rovers on loan with an option to buy for  £10m. West Brom and Sheffield United were also interested. Leicester have confirmed the departure of Ayoze Perez to Real Betis on a loan deal until the end of the season. The 29-year-old Spaniard has scored just one goal in 13 appearances across all competitions, with his eight Premier League games failing to deliver what Brendan Rodgers would have hoped.
