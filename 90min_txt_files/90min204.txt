Bayern Munich have held talks with Brentford over signing goalkeeper David Raya, 90min understands. The German giants are set to part ways with Yann Sommer this summer and are on the lookout for a new high-level stopper to cover for the injured Manuel Neuer, who has not played since breaking his leg during a holiday after the World Cup. Sources have confirmed to 90min that Raya has emerged on Bayern's radar and talks have been held with Brentford, but the Bees remain adamant that they will only do business if their asking price of  £40m is met. Raya is in the final year of his contract at the Brentford Community Stadium and has previously admitted concerns over his asking price, which proved problematic in talks with Tottenham earlier this summer. Spurs did not want to pay  £40m and ended up turning their attention to Guglielmo Vicario, eventually signing the stopper from Empoli for less than half that figure. feed The same fee has been put to Bayern, who are considering their next move in a summer which has already seen Kim Min-jae, Raphael Guerreiro and Konrad Laimer make the move to the Allianz Arena. Bayern brought in Sommer in January after learning of Neuer's injury and the Swiss international helped lead the team to yet another Bundesliga title, but the 34-year-old is now expected to leave just six months later. Inter are known to be keen as they seek to replace Andre Onana, who has joined Manchester United. Sommer has a release clause in his Bayern contract and the club's honourary president, Uli Hoeness, recently confirmed they would not stand in the goalkeeper's way if he chooses to leave. "He has a clause that he could leave if he wanted to," Hoeness revealed earlier this month. "We have opened talks with him, we told him so. We will consider each other's perspectives."
