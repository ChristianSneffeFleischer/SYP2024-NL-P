Chelsea had a  £50m bid for Southampton teenager Romeo Lavia turned down before the transfer deadline. The young Belgian had only just the Saints from Manchester City. Chelsea also expressed interested in signing Sander Berge from Sheffield United. Despite the need to raise cash, Barcelona rejected a  £30m Arsenal offer to take Ferran Torres back to the Premier League. Xavi wanted to keep the Spanish forward. Liverpool held interest in Juventus midfielder Denis Zakaria, who eventually joined Chelsea on loan, while the Reds captured Arthur instead. Carlo Ancelotti has claimed that Real Madrid never thought about signing more players after wrapping up deals for Antonio Rudiger and Aurelien Tchouameni early in the summer. Manchester United walked away from the chance to sign Moises Caicedo for  £4.5m in January 2021 over potential complicated payments. But Brighton concluded the deal anyway and the Ecuadorean has impressed in the Premier League and has since been linked with Liverpool.
