Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has confirmed that he plans to send Facundo Pellistri this season, with the teenage Uruguayan likely to get more game time elsewhere in the short-term. Pellistri impressed during the club   s opening pre-season game of the summer, scoring as a predominantly young United side beat Wayne Rooney   s Derby 2-1 at Pride Park. The 19-year-old   s second half strike, which saw him calmly take the ball round Derby goalkeeper Kelle Roos after slot into an empty net after being fed by Shola Shoretire, proved decisive. Pellistri joined United from Uruguayan giants Penarol last October and initially spent time with the Under-23 squad, impressing at that level before moving to Spain with Alaves on loan for the second half of the season. This @FPellistri07 finish is ?????????? worth another look ?#MUFC pic.twitter.com/vmW2BaWJl5 He is yet to make a competitive first-team appearance for the club but the plan is for the player to head out on loan again this season as a result of the interest in him.    I can see a loan deal for him," Solskjaer told ManUtd.com.    There   s been loads of interest and for his best interests as well, I think a loan will be what we look for.    On the player   s performance, the boss added,    I thought he was bright, of course he takes his goal really well. First touch, good pass from Shola, but great first touch sets him up.    I think he shows what he is, he   s a difficult player to play against. One against one he can go up past people and I   m very pleased with him.
