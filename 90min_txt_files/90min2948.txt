Cristiano Ronaldo is so adamant on leaving Manchester United this summer that he has asked the club to release him from his contract. Atletico Madrid and Bayern Munich have both distanced themselves from Ronaldo, whose contract has one year left to run plus the option of a further 12 months, in recent days. Juventus are trying to finalise an agreement to sign Roberto Firmino from Liverpool, which would bring an end to their pursuits of Timo Werner, Anthony Martial and Memphis Depay. Werner and Depay have both been offered to Newcastle United in recent weeks, as have Arsenal winger Nicolas Pepe and PSG playmaker Julian Draxler. Barcelona remain confident of signing Cesar Azpilicueta and Marcos Alonso from Chelsea, having already poached long-term target Jules Kounde from under the Blues' noses. Arsenal have no intention of reigniting their interest in Juventus midfielder Arthur Melo, who is likely to join Valencia on an initial loan instead. A knee injury to Paul Pogba means that Weston McKennie will not be allowed to leave Juventus this window. The USMNT midfielder had been linked to Tottenham and Southampton. Manchester City are assessing alternate options to Marc Cucurella after baulking at Brighton's  Â£50m asking price, and Benfica left-back Alex Grimaldo has emerged as a target. Frenkie de Jong has informed his Barcelona teammates that he will be staying at Camp Nou this summer despite Manchester United's confidence of eventually completing a deal. PSG made one final late move to try and sign Gianluca Scamacca, but he knocked it back as he had already given his word to West Ham. Leeds United and Leicester City's hopes of signing Charles De Ketelaere are all but over after AC Milan finally agreed a fee with Club Brugge for the young forward.
