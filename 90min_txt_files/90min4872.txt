Martin Odegaard's proposed move to Arsenal is nearing completion, with a loan fee and wages agreed to take the midfielder from Real Madrid to the Emirates. Odegaard requested a temporary move away from Los Blancos earlier in January having failed to break into Zinedine Zidane's starting XI following a successful loan spell at Real Sociedad last season. The Gunners' interest in the Norway international was known before it became clear he wanted to again depart on loan and a number of outlets have now reported that the deal is edging closer and closer to completion. The Times say a  £1.8m loan fee for the rest of the season has been agreed, with Arsenal also paying Odegaard's  £38,000-per-week wages, taking the cost of the deal to  £2.5m. The move is expected to be completed in the week - possibly even on Monday at the very earliest. AS add he will fly to London on Sunday, while Fabrizio Romano has stuck his patented 'here we go' trademark on the move with a tweet. There is no option to make the signing permanent, with the Times adding Real want Odegaard to be available for the next manager should Zidane leave his post at the Bernabeu by the end of the season. A telephone call from Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta is said to have convinced Odegaard to make the temporary switch to the Premier League rather than return to La Real, where he excelled during the 2019/20 term. The 22-year-old contributed four goals and six assists for the San Sebastian side and has previously spent time on loan in the Netherlands.
