Fifteen years after departing the club, Theo Walcott has re-joined Southampton - the club where he began his professional career - from Everton on a season-long loan. Walcott joined the Southampton youth system in 2000, making his debut as a 16-year-old in 2005, before moving to Arsenal the following January. Welcome home, @theowalcott! ? pic.twitter.com/WjyIqHQEcH    I was seriously lost for words when Southampton came on the table, and for me it was such an easy decision," Walcott told Southampton's official club website.     I will probably cry, I bet, when I first play, and it means so much. All the people that made it happen, I can   t thank them enough. Honestly, I   m so pleased. To get the chance to work with the manager as well and these young players that are coming through, I feel like I   ve made the right choice.    Manager Ralph Hasenhuttl added:    There is a lot of history between this club and Theo, so I know how special this will be for him and for our supporters. But what is most important to me is that we have signed a player who can help our squad and give us another strong option in our attack. It   s been some start to the season @Everton We have a great squad and with Mr Ancelotti in charge I   m sure it   s going to be a great campaign! Wishing the fans, players and staff the best of luck   see you soon! ? pic.twitter.com/yuYnZRtcag
