Arsenal are in talks over a deal for Benfica full-back Alex Grimaldo having submitted a  £6m bid, 90min can confirm. The Spaniard is available for a cut price with his contract in the Portuguese capital set to expire in 12 months' time. An attacking left-sided defender, Grimaldo has spent six years with Benfica following a move from Barcelona. However, he has reportedly been training alone during pre-season having turned down a new deal at Estadio da Luz. Although his defensive ability has been called into question, the former Spain Under-21 international is productive going forward - contributing a combined 15 goals and assists last season. Arsenal are on the lookout for a covering left-back for current starter Kieran Tierney - who has had his injury problems - with Nuno Tavares' future uncertain, and Grimaldo has emerged as a viable option given he could be available for a relatively low fee. 90min understands the Gunners have tested the water with a  £6m bid for the 26-year-old and are now engaged in talks with the Portuguese giants over a possible transfer.
