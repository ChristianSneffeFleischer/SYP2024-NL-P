Saudi Pro League champions Al Ittihad have announced the signing of N'Golo Kante from Chelsea. The Frenchman will join on a three-year contract which is worth roughly    86m and becomes Al Ittihad's second high profile signing of the summer following Karim Benzema's arrival.  Al Ittihad said in a statement: "The contract [with Kante] was finalized on Tuesday, June 20th, after he completed his medical tests at a specialized medical center in Dubai. "This move comes as Ittihad, who recently won the Saudi Professional League, aims to strengthen their squad. "Kante's addition to Al-Ittihad is considered one of the most high-profile and impactful signings in the club's history. It is part of the club's efforts to establish itself as a top choice for world-class players in the Saudi Professional League." manual Kante has brought to an end his seven-year stay at Chelsea, where he helped the club win six major honours, including one Premier League title and their second-ever Champions League. He arrived in England back in 2015, spending one year at Leicester City and playing a starring role in their miraculous title-winning season. The 32-year-old's final year at Chelsea was hampered by injury, picking up a hamstring problem against Tottenham on the second weekend of the campaign and not featuring again until the spring.
