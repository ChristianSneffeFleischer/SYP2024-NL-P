Crystal Palace starlet Zion Atta is leaving Selhurst Park after turning down their latest contract offer. 90min first revealed in January that Atta was looking to leave, and he now looks destined to move to France to join Ligue 1 club Nice. The 16-year-old has long been heralded as one of the best young players in England, and up to this point was considered one of the best for his age in Europe. Despite off-field issues that have seen him switch representation to super agent Mino Raiola, Atta has still had a host of clubs chasing him throughout his time at Palace. Atta joined Palace when he was 14 from London rivals Millwall, and his progression has continued - the Eagles even believed that he could push for a first team squad place before he was 17. However, Atta's demands were too much for Palace and now they are set to lose him. Most of England's top clubs have been chasing him for years - but the youngster has always had an ambition to play abroad. Although an England youth international, Atta was actually born in Italy, and the Italian FA are fighting hard to convince him to switch allegiance.
