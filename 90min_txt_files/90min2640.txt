Wesley Fofana will not take part in Leicester City's match with Chelsea this weekend amid the Blues' ongoing pursuit of the defender, Foxes boss Brendan Rodgers has confirmed. Chelsea have had multiple bids for Fofana knocked back by Leicester this summer already. 90min understands it will take an offer of at least  £80m in order for the Frenchman to make the move to Stamford Bridge, with both Chelsea and Fofana frustrated at this impasse.

"He won   t be available for for the weekend. He has trained with the with the Under-23 squad," Rodgers confirmed. "My concentration is with the players that we have in the team so I can   s lose energy thinking too much about it for myself, but it   ll be something that will be done between the clubs. Until that happens and we have the continued to work with what we have."
