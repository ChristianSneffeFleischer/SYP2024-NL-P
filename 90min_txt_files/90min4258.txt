Ajax are interested making a move for out-of-favour Tottenham Hotspur winger Steven Bergwijn, who wants away from Spurs in search of regular first-team football.  The Dutch winger was one of Jose Mourinho's first signings at the club, arriving in January of 2020, but after strong half-season after signing, he struggled to impress in his first full season of Premier League football, only starting 13 league fixtures during the 2020/21 campaign.  According to the Daily Mail, his struggles in north London may be brought to an end this summer, as Ajax are keen to bring the 23-year old back to the Eredivisie. The move, however, would require the Dutch giants to match what Tottenham forked out for him. Spurs brought Bergwijn to England from PSV Eindhoven in a deal worth  Â£27m - a substantial fee for Ajax, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. Furthermore, it is thought that the club want the wide midfielder to remain at Tottenham for the start of pre-season with Mourinho's permanent successor (increasingly likely to be Nuno Espirito Santo) at least - allowing the faint possibility of a regular, long-term future at Spurs for Bergwijn. The 23-year old's move to Ajax would suit him, though. Bergwijn would be returning to the Eredivisie , where he has proven his quality, while his international ambitions would regain momentum.
