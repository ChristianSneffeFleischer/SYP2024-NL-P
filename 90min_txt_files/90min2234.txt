Barcelona midfielder Pedri has sent a message to Real Madrid's Marco Asensio, telling his Spain teammate that 'all good players have to be at Barcelona'.  Asensio is out of contract at the end of the season and, although he has stressed his desire to sign an extension, he has publicly flirted with a move to Barcelona - comments he later claimed were 'misinterpreted'. With a new contract yet to land on his table, Asensio continues to be linked with a free transfer to Barcelona. While Pedri did not want to make a direct plea to Asensio, he could not resist sending a clear message to his Spain teammate.    He has a lot of quality, let   s see what happens with his contract but all good players have to be at Bar  a," Pedri told COPE when asked about Asensio.  "Let   s see what happens with his contract but he has plenty of qualities. It is a decision that he has to make." Asensio had previously refused to rule out making the move across the Clasico divide but publicly changed his tune in a recent interview, in which he insisted he wants to remain in Madrid for a little whole longer. Scott Saunders  hosts  Graeme Bailey  in the latest episode of Talking Transfers, discussing Cristiano Ronaldo's interview and his future, Man Utd's interest in Cody Gakpo, plus the latest on Endrick and Rafael Leao.
