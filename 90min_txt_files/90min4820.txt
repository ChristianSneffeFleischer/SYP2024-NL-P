Manchester United have placed Sevilla centre-back Jules Kounde at the top of their shopping list ahead of the summer transfer window. Despite their rampant spending on defenders in recent years, United still haven't managed to find a formula at the back to help take them back to the very top. Kounde, who Sevilla reportedly value at around  Â£60m, was linked with a host of top clubs around Europe last summer, including United and Manchester City, and the Mirror write that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has identified the 22-year-old as his top target for the 2021 summer window. The Frenchman has emerged as one of the most talented young defenders in Europe since moving to Sevilla in 2019. His athletic ability and impressive reading of the game makes Kounde an exciting prospect for clubs in need of a progressive, young centre-back. He has been on United's radar for a while, but sold his qualities even more when Sevilla knocked the Red Devils out of the Europa League on their way to winning the competition last season. Kounde has carried that form into this season, having already racked up 27 appearances. Man Utd have failed to find the ideal partner for Harry Maguire despite boasting a wealth of defensive options. Eric Bailly has impressed recently but continues to fight a tiresome injury record, as does Axel Tuanzebe. Victor Lindelof is usually the go-to man and has featured 23 times so far this season. Utility player Timothy Fosu-Mensah departed for Bayer Leverkusen earlier in the window, while Marcos Rojo is expected to join Boca Juniors.
