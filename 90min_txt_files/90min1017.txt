Atalanta will not sell Rasmus Hojlund cheaply this summer despite the in-demand striker's request to leave, sources have told 90min. Hojlund joined Atalanta in a    17m deal last summer from Sturm Graz, who themselves had only signed him from Copenhagen the previous January. The Dane has scored eight goals in 31 Serie A appearances this season and has attracted interest from Manchester United. 90min understands Hojlund has made it clear to the Serie A club through agents SEG that he would like to move on following their failure to qualify for the Champions League. Chelsea have already held talks with Atalanta about a possible deal, with Atalanta chief executive Luca Percassi visiting England in April for exploratory discussions. Man Utd are now talking with Percassi, while Arsenal, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain have also touched base with Atalanta and the player's agents. SEG are also the agents of United manager Erik ten Hag, who has been looking at Hojlund for much of this year. feed United's prefered plan is to bring in two strikers this summer. The Red Devils are targeting one younger option and a more established version. Hojlund would fit into the former category, but he would not come cheap. 90min understands United among other suitors have been informed by Atalanta it will take    65m to    70m ( Â£55m) to prise the 20-year-old away from Gewiss Stadium. That figure would see Atalanta earn more than quadruple what they paid for him in just one season. As well as Hojlund, United are still assessing other targets such as Harry Kane, Victor Osimhen, Lauturo Martinez, Benjamin Sesko, Mohammed Kudus and Randal Kolo-Muani.
