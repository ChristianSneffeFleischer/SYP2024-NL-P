Bayern Munich are interested in completing a loan deal for struggling Atletico Madrid winger Thomas Lemar. The Frenchman was tipped to reach the very top of world football after a number of sizzling displays at AS Monaco, performances which earned him a whopping    70m move to Atletico. But the 24-year-old has struggled to make any kind of impression in La Liga, and failed to register a single goal during the 2019/20 campaign. His nightmare spell in the Spanish capital could have a happy ending though, as Sport Bild report that Bayern Munich - who have ruled the Bundesliga for as long as anybody can possibly remember - are interested in signing him on loan. Die Roten already have Serge Gnabry and Kingsley Coman on their books, and also completed the signing of Manchester City winger Leroy San   over the summer. But manager Hansi Flick, who has done an incredible job after succeeding Niko Kovac as boss, wants increased depth and competition for places as Bayern look to maintain their domestic and European dominance. The congested fixture schedule that teams around Europe are facing is mooted as another reason for Bayern's interest, as players are expected to play games once every three days in the early stages of this season. That has put an inevitable strain on player fitness, and Flick is keen to ease the burden on his squad by widening his options. If Bayern wish to push forward with a deal for Lemar, they must conclude a deal within the week - as the transfer window closes on 5 October.
