Manchester United are said to be in 'concrete negotiations' with Milan creator Hakan Calhanoglu over a potential free transfer next summer.  After often flattering to deceive following his 2017 move from Bayer Leverkusen, the 26-year-old Turkish international has emerged as one of the key protagonists in Stefano Pioli's Rossoneri.  Calhanoglu has been influential in Milan's current 18-game unbeaten run, starting the season with a pair of assists after notching 18 goal contributions last time out.  He's now into the final year of his contract at San Siro and despite his stellar form, recent reports suggest talks have stalled regarding a new deal.  It's understood that the creative midfielder isn't satisfied with the terms Milan are offering - thought to be the equivalent of  Â£54,000 per week - and Manchester United are thought to be one of the clubs to have shown an interest in picking him up on a free transfer at the end of the season. United are supposedly willing to offer the Milan man a five-year deal at Old Trafford and double his current Rossoneri salary. The claims are somewhat supported by Bild's Christian Falk, who reports that that Red Devils are currently negotiating with Calhanoglu's representatives after initially showing an interest in the summer.  It's understood that Calhanoglu rejected an approach from Juventus after United's interest surfaced.  Nevertheless, this whole situation has to be met with plenty of scepticism.  The player himself isn't said to be pushing for a move away from an exciting project in Milan, and it's certainly feasible that this is another example of agents and representatives leaking stories to the press in a bid to hand them greater leverage on the negotiation table, in this case with the Rossoneri.
