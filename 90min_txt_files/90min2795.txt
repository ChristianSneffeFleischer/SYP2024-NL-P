Juventus are close to finalising a deal for Barcelona forward Memphis Depay, 90min understands. Barca are desperate to trim their squad to help them meet La Liga financial regulations which have thus far meant they have not been able to register the new players that have arrived this summer. One of the most saleable assets at Camp Nou is Depay, with a number of clubs showing an interest in him. The Dutchman, who arrived from Lyon as a free agent just last year, was informed by the club earlier this summer that he could move on. Tottenham, Newcastle, Lyon and Paris Saint Germain have all been linked with an approach, but Juventus are very much in pole position to finalise a deal.  Barcelona secured Robert Lewandowski earlier this summer but cannot afford to go into the season with him, Depay and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who has also been in talks about his future. Sources have told 90min that it is 'highly unlikely' that the Catalans would allow both Depay and Aubameyang both to leave this month. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  &  Sean Walsh  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Man Utd's transfer market implosion in targeting deals for Adrien Rabiot & Marko Arnautovic, Man City's stance on selling Bernardo Silva to Barcelona, Wilfried Zaha's future and more.
