Barcelona are prioritising the signings of a centre-forward and a left-back in the summer transfer window, with Valencia defender Jose Gaya becoming 'an obsession' for the Catalonian board. The Blaugrana were busy in the winter window, bringing Ferran Torres, Dani Alves, Adama Traore and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to Camp Nou. Bar  a director Jordi Cruyff recently admitted that the club were keen to strengthen at left-back last month to but were unable to find a suitable player at the right place. And Sport report that Barcelona will continue their search for a long-term replacement for the ageing Jordi Alba in the summer. While Erling Haaland remains Bar  a's top striker target and Cesar Azpilicueta has been touted to arrive on a free transfer from Chelsea and add depth at right-back, there are two standout options for the left-back position. The first is Valencia captain Jose Gaya, who has become 'an obsession' for the sporting arm of Barcelona's board in recent years as they believe he is the 'natural' successor to Alba. However, Gaya wants to discuss terms of a new contract with Valencia before deciding his future, but Bar  a will be waiting in the wings with his current deal set to expire in 2023.
