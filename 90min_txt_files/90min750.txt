Real Madrid have confirmed Toni Kroos has signed a contract extension to keep him at the club until 2024. 90min revealed in April a new deal had been agreed for the 33-year-old to stay at the Santiago Bernabeu. He first joined the club in 2014 and has since enjoyed year after year of success in Spain's capital. Kroos has played 417 matches for Real since leaving Bayern, winning four Champions Leagues alongside three La Liga titles and other domestic and European honours.  He formed one of the greatest midfield partnerships with Casemiro - who left last year for Manchester United - and fellow stalwart Luka Modric, who is also expected to stay for another year despite heavy interest from Saudi Arabia. Kroos' fresh deal is further good news for manager Carlo Ancelotti, who has a lot of options in midfield for the 2023/24 season. feed Jude Bellingham has arrived from Borussia Dortmund in one of the biggest deals of the summer, while Aurelien Tchouameni and Eduardo Camavinga have also arrived in recent years with Real. Federico Valverde has developed into one of the best midfielders in the world and Dani Ceballos was also given plenty of game time last season. It'll be a new-look Real team elsewhere with Karim Benzema departing for Saudi Arabian champions Al Ittihad. Marco Asensio and Mariano Diaz left at the end of their contracts and Eden Hazard was released a year early. Brahim Diaz has returned from his AC Milan loan and signed a two-year contract, while striker Joselu has arrived temporary with the option of a permanent deal next year.
