Barcelona winger Ousmane Dembele is in line to complete a move to Paris Saint-Germain by the end of the week, 90min understands. 90min reported on Monday that Dembele had agreed personal terms over a move back to France, which came as a bit of a shock to the footballing world considering there had been little speculation suggesting he was looking to leave this summer. Barca head coach Xavi and new club captain Sergi Roberto have both spoken of their surprise and disappointment of Dembele's fresh intentions to leave. Sources have now confirmed to 90min that PSG are closing in on the signing of Dembele after paying a    50m ( £43m) release clause in his Barcelona contract. With that money, the Spanish champions will step up their pursuit of Manchester City's Joao Cancelo. Xavi spoke earlier this week of his desperation to bring in a new right-back and the sale of Dembele should allow them further flexibility in the summer transfer market. feed PSG are hoping to finalise Dembele's move by the end of the week, and 90min understands they are also looking to push through a move for Benfica forward Goncalo Ramos in that timeframe as well. Both head coach Luis Enrique and sporting advisor Luis Campos are keen to add Ramos to their ranks. The French champions previously held an interest in Manchester United-bound Rasmus Hojlund. Ramos is expected to arrive for a fee in the region of    80m ( £69m), while PSG retain an interest in his Portugal teammate Joao Felix. The 23-year-old spent the second half of last season on loan at Chelsea but has since returned to Atletico Madrid. PSG's negotiations with Atleti are not currently advanced, though the deal is not completely dead yet.
