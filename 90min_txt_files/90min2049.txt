Erik ten Hag has confirmed that Manchester United are in the market for new signings, but refused to comment on Cody Gakpo moving to Liverpool instead of Old Trafford. Gakpo was widely expected to join Man Utd after a breakout 2022 FIFA World Cup, but in a shock turn of events, Liverpool have swooped in to sign the highly-rated forward for an initial  Â£37m. Speaking after his side's comfortable 3-0 win over Nottingham Forest on Tuesday evening, Ten Hag refused to be drawn on questions regarding Gakpo's move to arch rivals Liverpool, but he did reveal that Man Utd are in the market for new signings. "We are always in the market but it has to match the sporting criteria but also the financial criteria and we will do what we can to bring that player in that we need," he said. "I don't talk about any individual cases [Gakpo]. I am not looking at other teams, I am looking at our team. I am convinced in the players we have, individual and as a team, that we can compete with those other teams." During his press conference, the Man Utd manager also talked about his side's need to be more clinical and efficient in front of goal.
