Fulham are attempting to beat Lyon to the signing of West Ham United defender Issa Diop, 90min can confirm. The 25-year-old is one of five senior centre-backs on the books at London Stadium, a figure boosted this summer by the arrival of Nayef Aguerd from Rennes in a deal worth    30m. 90min revealed at the end of June that West Ham are open to allowing Diop to leave the club, in search of more regular first-team football, and there's been strong interest from Ligue 1 giants Lyon. However, Premier League new boys Fulham - who won the Championship title last season - are making moves to strengthen their squad, and 90min understands that they are now locked in talks with West Ham over a permanent transfer. Listen now to 90min's Talking Transfers podcast, with  Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey,  Harry Symeou  &  Toby Cudworth. On the latest show they discuss Cristiano Ronaldo's future at Manchester United, Newcastle preparing to break their transfer record for Moussa Diaby, Bayern Munich's interest in Chelsea target Matthijs de Ligt and more. Available on  all audio platforms  and the  90min YouTube channel. If you can't see the podcast embed, click  here  to download the episode in full! It's believed Fulham are willing to pay around  Â£15m for Diop, who joined West Ham from Toulouse four years ago, although that figure - which exceeds what Lyon had put forward - may fall slightly short of the Hammers' valuation. Nevertheless, there's an expectation that Diop will be heading on to pastures new this summer, with David Moyes instead seeing Aguerd, Kurt Zouma, Craig Dawson and Angelo Ogbonna as his preferred options.
