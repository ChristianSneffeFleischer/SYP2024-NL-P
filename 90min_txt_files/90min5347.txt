Tottenham Hotspur flop Gedson Fernandes seems destined to return to parent club Benfica in the January transfer window, cutting short his original loan agreement by six months.  The Portuguese starlet joined Spurs at the turn of the year on an initial 18-month loan, with a    50m option to buy if Fernandes were to impress in north London. That has proven to be far from the case, however, and his lack of game time means he could be set to end his Tottenham nightmare half a year earlier than anticipated.  Benfica are preparing to bring back their highly-rated midfielder, and club president Lu  s Filipe Vieira confirmed the likelihood of a premature reunion while speaking on Portuguese programme Trio d'Ataque. The 21-year-old struggled to make his mark during his first half-season at Spurs, taking to the field on only seven occasions in the Premier League - playing bit-part roles in each match. Fernandes clearly failed to win over head coach Jose Mourinho during that period, and he has yet to gain his trust this season, either.  The Portugal Under-21 international has not played a single minute of top-flight football since the new campaign began, with his only appearance coming in the Carabao Cup victory over Chelsea at the end of September.
