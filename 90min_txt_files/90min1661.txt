Manchester United have been offered the chance to sign Marcel Sabitzer prior to Tuesday's transfer deadline, sources have told 90min. The Red Devils are in some need of reinforcement in midfield following confirmation that Christian Eriksen could be out of action until May with an ankle injury. United had not planned to bring in a new senior player on deadline day, but as is always the case they have remained open to deals if good opportunities present themselves. 90min understands that manager Erik ten Hag was happy with the balance of his squad, but has advised United to try and add to their midfield arsenal - Bruno Fernandes, Fred and Casemiro are their only fit central midfielders at present - because of Eriksen's injury. That could lead to a loan move for Sabitzer, 90min understands, with contact made over a potential switch to Old Trafford. Listen now as  Scott Saunders  hosts  Graeme Bailey  and  Toby Cudworth  to discuss why Joao Cancelo looks set to join Bayern Munich on loan from Man City, Arsenal's ongoing pursuit of Moises Caicedo & the futures of Pedro Porro, Enzo Fernandez, Youri Tielemans and more.

Sabitzer's agent, Roger Wittmann, recently suggested to Bild that the 27-year-old, who has also been linked with Chelsea, was happy at Bayern despite his limited game time, and commented that "Marcel feels comfortable with Bayern and has signed a five-year contract. To date, neither the club nor we have claimed anything else."
