The Barcelona squad are said to be desperate to see Neymar return to the club this summer and hope his return can aid their bid for Champions League glory. The Brazilian swapped Barcelona for Paris Saint-Germain four years ago in a world record    222m ( Â£192m) deal. Since moving to Ligue 1 he's helped PSG to three consecutive French titles and notably came within 90 minutes of securing the club's first ever Champions League crown last season. Meanwhile, Bar  a have failed to even reach the final of Europe's premier competition since Neymar's departure, and Mundo Deportivo report that the club's current crop of players are hopeful of him making a return to Camp Nou. Neymar spent four years with the La Liga giants prior to his move to France, picking up no fewer than two league titles, three Copa del Reys and one Champions League. With just one year remaining on his deal with PSG, it's hoped that the reigning French champions could be persuaded to cash in on their talisman this summer to avoid the possibility of losing him for nothing next year. One of the biggest stumbling blocks in any potential move would undoubtedly be the hefty transfer fee PSG would command, though with Les Parisiens reported admirers of Barcelona pair Ousmane Dembele and Antoine Griezmann, a possible deal is far from out of the question. That being said, Griezmann is particularly unhappy at the prospect of a move to PSG given his love for Lique 1 outfit Marseille. Neymar's salary demands are also likely to cause problems in any potential deal, and there's expected to be a number of outgoings at Camp Nou if the prospect of his return becomes a reality.
