Danny Rose will be unavailable for Newcastle's clash with his parent club Tottenham, but Steve Bruce has admitted there will be 'conversations' about the loan star's future this summer. Rose joined the Magpies on loan from Spurs in January, and has featured 11 times in all competitions since his arrival at St James' Park. The fullback started Newcastle's recent defeats to Watford and Manchester City, but the Magpies will be without Rose for Wednesday's encounter with Tottenham because of the Premier League's loan rules. The 30-year-old's Tottenham contract expires in 2021, and he had originally intended to remain in north London to see out his deal. However, Rose fell out of favour at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium after Jose Mourinho replaced Mauricio Pochettino, and recently admitted that his time at Spurs would likely come to an end sooner rather than later. "It doesn't take a rocket scientist to work out that my days are numbered at Spurs," he said. "It is probably the first time in my career I have been in this situation - never have I been down to less than one year on my contract - so it's a new experience for me." Rose had his Newcastle loan extended in June to enable him to see out the remainder of the season with the Magpies. The England international admitted that he was enjoying his time at St James' Park, and stated that he was 'playing for his future' - suggesting a permanent move to the North East could be on the cards. Bruce remained coy as to whether his side would be able take the left to St James' Park permanently, but revealed he believes Rose is yet to produce his best in a black and white shirt.
