Nottingham Forest have completed their first signing of the January transfer window - Brazilian attacking midfielder Gustavo Scarpa on a three-year deal. The 28-year-old had agreed to join Forest in January earlier this year, with his contract at Palmerias up on the final day of 2022. Gustavo had not been able to finalise his arrival until now as he was busy helping Palmerias win an 11th  Brazilian Serie A title last month, but he has now penned a three-year contract at the City Ground running until 2026.  He'll be available to play after the turn of the year, when Forest hope an upturn in results will help stave off relegation from the Premier League. "I'm very happy to be here, it's a dream for me," Gustavo, who has been capped once by Brazil and is well-known for his love of skateboarding and ability to solve Rubik's cubes, told Forest's official website.
