Wolves have confirmed the signing of Matheus Cunha from Atletico Madrid, becoming new manager Julen Lopetegui's first incoming transfer. The Brazil international has signed on loan in a deal which will automatically become permanent until 2027 if certain clauses are triggered. Cunha previously impressed with RB Leipzig and Hertha Berlin before moving to Atletico in 2021. However, after a promising debut season in which he scored six La Liga goals, the 23-year-old fell out of the picture under Diego Simeone, starting just two league games in 2022/23. He joins a Wolves side in legitimate relegation strife, sitting bottom of the Premier League table having played 15 games. He told the Wanderers' website:    I   m really excited to be part of this group and to be part of this club     it   s a big club.    I   m excited to play in the Premier League, to play in Wolverhampton, and I think the most important point is that I   m happy like a kid.    I know him [Lopetegui] as we   ve played against each other three or four times, and he   s a big coach, he has a big mentality.
