Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta has admitted that he still wants the club to make more signings before the summer transfer window closes for Premier League teams on 1 September. So far, the Gunners have brought in Gabriel Jesus and Oleksandr Zincheko for a combined  Â£75m from reigning champions Manchester City, as well as spending big on Fabio Vieira from Porto and bringing in Brazilian teenager Marquinhos and American goalkeeper Matt Turner. Jesus in particular has hit the ground running in pre-season, but Arteta is holding onto hope that more new faces arrive. Various midfielders have been linked with a switch to the Emirates Stadium, including Leicester   s Youri Tielemans and Lyon   s Lucas Paqueta. "We are still hoping to do something else if the market allows. You have seen some movement in the last few days as well," Arteta told the media on Saturday. "We want to get the perfect balance and the plan we wanted from the beginning. Whether we accomplish that or not is another story." 90min revealed in May that Leicester are resigned to losing Tielemans this summer. The Belgian is just 11 months away from becoming a free agent and the Foxes are prepared to consider offers as he has repeatedly knocked back their attempts to tie him to a new deal.

However, Leicester chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha, otherwise known as    Top   , recently revealed that the club still hasn   t received any firm offers for Tielemans: "It's nothing. There haven't been any offers yet. There hasn't been anything concrete or a proposition yet." 90min understands that Arsenal do still hold an interest in Tielemans.
