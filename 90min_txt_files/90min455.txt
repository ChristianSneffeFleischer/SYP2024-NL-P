Thiago Silva has admitted he asked Paulo Dybala to join Chelsea after reports linked the forward with a move to Stamford Bridge.  The Argentine World Cup winner has recently been linked by Italian press with a move to Chelsea this summer, with the player reportedly having a    12m release clause in his contract at current club AS Roma.  Speaking to Sky Sport Italia about the rumours while at Silverstone for a F1 race, Chelsea captain Thiago Silva admitted that he has asked Dybala if he's joining the Blues, saying: "I saw Paulo Dybala here, they [the media] talk about him coming to Chelsea. I   ve talked with him and asked him if he is coming.  "He is a world class player. I would love to play with him and it would be a massive signing. Let   s see." feed Dybala joined Roma last season following the expiration of his contract at Juventus, but has been plagued by injuries since making the move.  During the 2022/23 campaign the forward missed 18 games with various ailments, but did manage to score 18 goals and bag seven assists in all competitions for Jose Mourinho's side - including one while not fully fit in the UEFA Europa League final.   Asked by Italian press at an airport on Saturday, Roma manager Jose Mourinho was asked about the reports that Dybala could be on his way to Chelsea: "I don't know about about his contract", said Moruinho. "But obviously I talk to Paulo like I do with all of my players."  Chelsea have already been active in the transfer window this summer, signing forwards Christopher Nkunku and Nicolas Jackson for a combined    87m.
