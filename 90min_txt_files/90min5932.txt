Belgian forward Christian Benteke has been put up for sale this summer by Crystal Palace. The 29-year-old arrived at Selhurst Park from Liverpool in 2016 for a whopping  £32m. He enjoyed an impressive debut season at the Eagles, scoring 17 times in all competitions.    However, Benteke's form since then has deteriorated, as he's only six goals over the last three seasons.  And now Roy Hodgson is willing to let the Belgian leave Crystal Palace this transfer window, with the Daily Mail reporting that the south London club would listen to offers of around  £7m. The forward has apparently already turned down a move to a club in the Middle East.  The Belgian forward is not the only one struggling in front of goal at Selhurst Park. Only relegated Norwich City scored fewer goals in the previous Premier League campaign, while only Ghanaian forward Jordan Ayew surpassed the five-goal mark for Roy Hodgson's men.  The Eagles have already agreed a  £19.5m fee with QPR for midfielder Eberechi Eze in an attempt to quell their attacking woes, and are also looking to sign a new striker, with Danny Welbeck, Jean-Philippe Mateta, Ollie Watkins, and Rhian Brewster all linked. Benteke burst onto the scene in English football back in 2012 after a stunning debut season at Aston Villa. His 19 Premier League goals helped keep the Villans in the top flight as they avoided the drop by just five points.
