Chelsea have made a move for Everton starlet Anthony Gordon, sources have confirmed to 90min. 21-year-old Gordon has already been the subject of interest this summer with both Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle United failing with bids. Everton resisted the earlier offers, insisting that Gordon was not for sale, and even if he was it would take a bid in excess of  £50m - with both Tottenham and Newcastle not going above  £40m. Chelsea have now made an approach and are believed to have come up with an initial deal worth just over  £40m. 90min understands that Everton are considering their options as there is the possibility of doing a deal with Chelsea that could involve players, something Toffees boss Frank Lampard is believed to be interested in doing. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  &  Sean Walsh  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Man Utd's transfer market implosion in targeting deals for Adrien Rabiot & Marko Arnautovic, Man City's stance on selling Bernardo Silva to Barcelona, Wilfried Zaha's future and more.
