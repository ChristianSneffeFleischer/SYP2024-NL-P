Highly-rated defender Jules Kounde has suggested he would 'like to play for an even bigger club' than Sevilla, as he continues to draw attention from Europe's heavyweights. The 22-year-old has caught the eye ever since his    25m move from Bordeaux to La Liga in 2019, and his heroics have seen him linked with Premier League giants Manchester United in recent transfer windows. Kounde has done little to dampen rumours in a recent interview, admitting his ambitions are to play for 'an even bigger club' than Sevilla, and to see 'what the future holds'.    Going to Sevilla seemed to be the best option to try to improve myself and I don   t regret my choice,    he told Telefoot.     I   m already at a big club, but obviously I   d like to play for an even bigger club. We   ll see what the future holds for me, but it   s something that   s in my head."  The Frenchman's consistent displays for Sevilla have made him one of Europe's most in-demand defenders, and he has attracted particular attention from the Premier League as well as Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid.  90min exclusively revealed in March that Kounde is on Man Utd's radar for the summer transfer window, and along with Villarreal's Pau Torres tops the shortlist for the Red Devils' defensive targets.
