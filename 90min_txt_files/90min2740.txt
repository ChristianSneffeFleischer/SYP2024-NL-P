Manchester United's proposed move for Adrien Rabiot has hit an impasse after the Red Devils rejected Adrien Rabiot's wage demands, 90min understands.  Rabiot had been widely expected to join Man Utd this summer having already agreed a  Â£15m fee with Juventus for the player.  However, the club and the midfielder have been unable to agree personal terms in order to finalise a deal, with 90min learning that Rabiot's unwillingness to take a wage cut has proved to be an issue for the Old Trafford club.  We understand that the 27-year-old's mother, and agent, does not see why her son, and client, should lower his wage demands given that he will be available as a free agent once again next summer.  Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  &  Toby Cudworth  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Erik ten Hag wanting to sign five players before the transfer window closes, and Man Utd's attitude to selling Cristiano Ronaldo. Available on  all audio platforms  and the  90min YouTube channel. If you can't see the podcast embed, click  here  to download the episode in full! Rabiot was initially signed by Juventus as a free agent in 2019 and, due to the lack of transfer fee, earned himself a huge wage packet of    7m per year after tax in process.  Performances at La Vecchia Signora have not been particularly impressive however, with the club being very keen to shift the French international this summer.
