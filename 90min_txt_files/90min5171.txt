Newcastle are monitoring Manchester United full-back Brandon Williams with a view to taking the youngster on loan in January. Williams enjoyed a breakthrough year at Old Trafford last season, making 36 appearances in all competitions. However, he has featured just four times this term, with his only two starts coming in the Carabao Cup back in September. The United academy product is naturally right-footed but played much of last season at left-back during Luke Shaw's absence. However, Shaw's return to full fitness coupled with the signing of Alex Telles has seen Williams' first team opportunities limited. He is poised to be made available for a loan move in January, and according to the Chronicle, Newcastle scouts are monitoring the England Under-21 international.  Magpies boss Steve Bruce enjoys an 'excellent rapport' with Manchester United assistant manager Mike Phelan that dates back to his playing days, with the pair former teammates at Old Trafford and colleagues at Hull City. Bruce also has a strong relationship with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and consequently any loan offer for Williams from Newcastle would be taken seriously by United. The Magpies could face competition for the versatile defender's signature from high-flying Southampton, who are still keen on the youngster having failed to land him on loan in September. United are set to be prepared to allow Williams to leave the club on loan in January, having been reluctant to do so during the summer transfer window due to their congested Carabao Cup fixture list early in the season.
