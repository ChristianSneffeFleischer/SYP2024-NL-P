Manchester United midfielder Fred is on course to join Fenerbahce after a deal was agreed with the Turkish Super Lig giants ahead of their fiercest rivals, 90min understands. Fred made 56 appearances for United last season, although he was primarily a back-up option and started only 12 times in the Premier League. The Brazilian has since also seen Mason Mount join the club, adding further competition for midfield places. It was the arrivals of both Christian Eriksen and Casemiro last summer that initially pushed him down the Old Trafford pecking order. Fulham had been interested in Fred, who joined United ahead of Manchester City from Shakhtar Donetsk for close to  £50m in the summer of 2018, but were not prepared to meet the asking price. feed Nottingham Forest were also in touch with the player   s representatives, but didn   t take things further, while Roma made an enquiry too. As 90min reported at the time, Galatasaray had an offer rejected in mid-July because it fell short of the  £20m asking price. Now, however, United have agreed to sell for less. The deal negotiated with Fenerbahce is worth  £13m (   15m), inclusive of add-ons. Fred also resisted the opportunity to move to the Saudi Pro League, which has already welcomed the likes of N   Golo Kante, Fabinho, Jordan Henderson and Ruben Neves from the Premier League this summer.
