Serie A side Lazio are understood to be keen on out-of-favour Tottenham full back Danny Rose, who is currently on loan at Newcastle. Rose has been at St James' Park for the second half of this season having been deemed surplus to requirements at parent club Spurs. The Magpies are reportedly eager to secure the permanent signing of the England international, but it appears they now face competition from Italian giants Lazio. Corriere dello Sport claim the Biancocelesti are looking for replacements for both Senad Lulic and Jordan Lukaku, with Rose top of their summer wishlist. With just one year remaining on his current Tottenham deal, the 30-year-old could be available at a cut price, but Spurs are understood to be holding out for a fee in the region of  £5m. The Italian side have already made contact with Rose   s representatives, though a deal seems some way off with Lazio starting negotiations at  £2.7m. Despite the difference in valuation, Spurs will be keen to agree terms and avoid the risk of losing the full back on a  free next summer. Newcastle are yet to make a concrete bid for the left back, with ongoing takeover talks stalling any future transfer business. Rose    time in north London seems to be drawing to an end after 12 seasons at Spurs. After signing from Leeds in 2007, he has made 214 appearances for the club, earning 29 England international caps as well.
