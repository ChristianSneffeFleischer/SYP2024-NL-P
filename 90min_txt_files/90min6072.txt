Inter have taken a huge step towards signing Italian wonderkid Sandro Tonali from Brescia, after the youngster chose I Nerazzurri as his dream destination and agreed terms on a bumper five-year-contract. The 20-year-old has been on the radar of a number of Europe's elite clubs for several transfer windows, and he is destined to leave current side Brescia following their recent relegation from Serie A. Although he was unable to halt the Lioness' slide into the second tier, Tonali did impress during his debut campaign in the top flight. And with Inter, Juventus, Milan and Paris Saint-Germain all jostling to land the midfield talisman, Corriere dello Sport reports that I Nerazzurri may have won the race.  The Milanese club have offered Tonali a five-year contract worth    3.5m per season, and the midfielder has accepted their proposal, with his heart now fully set on a switch to San Siro.  The Italy international is currently on holiday, but he has asked his agent Beppe Bozzo to hash out an agreement with Inter chief executive Beppe Marotta, as he continues to watch I Nerazzurri's Europa League campaign with interest.  Tonali has stated his desire to grow under coach Antonio Conte's guidance, believing the Serie A giants to be the best landing spot to continue his development as one of Europe's most exciting prospects.  He will have also seen the great progress of the likes of fellow Italians Alessandro Bastoni, Stefano Sensi and Nicolo Barella, who have all announced their arrival on the big stage this season, thanks to Conte's trust in their abilities.
