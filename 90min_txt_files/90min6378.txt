Ajax have joined the race to sign Pierre-Emile H  jbjerg, from Southampton, though Tottenham remain the favourites to land the Danish midfielder.  H  jbjerg, 24, was replaced as Southampton captain by James Ward-Prowse in June after failing to agree a contract extension, with his current deal running out in the summer of 2021.  Southampton are expected to favour selling their former skipper this summer, for a deal worth around  £15m, to avoid losing him for free in a year's time. Ajax have apparently recently joined the list of clubs interested in the former Bayern Munich man, but Spurs are considered to be the frontrunners for his signature, with the Telegraph claiming the Denmark international wants to stay in the Premier League. The Amsterdam side do have history when it comes to signing players from Southampton, with Dusan Tadic joining the Dutch giants and helping them reach the Champions League semi-finals in 2019, where they were knocked out by Spurs in a thrilling contest.  H  jbjerg has also been linked with Everton recently, but it is considered to be more likely for him to make the move to north London, where Mourinho has struggled to settle on a midfield partnership since arriving in November.   Club-record signing, Tanguy Ndomb  l   has found Premier League minutes hard to come by since joining Tottenham and he is believed to want out, while Eric Dier has found himself playing in central defence more regularly than in midfield under Mourinho.  The Saints expect to recoup the  £12.8m they spent on H  jbjerg in 2016, but are well aware he would be worth more on a long-term contract.
