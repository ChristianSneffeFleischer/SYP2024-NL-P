Brazil winger Malcom is close to sealing a move to the Saudi Pro League, sources have confirmed to 90min. The 26-year-old forward has come off a fantastic season in Russia which saw him claim 23 goals and nine assists in just 27 games for Zenit St Petersburg. Malcom made it clear to Zenit that he was keen to move on and his form had attracted interest from a number of clubs, including Paris Saint-Germain, Arsenal and Manchester City. Sources have confirmed to 90min that Malcom was a name being considered by City should they lose Riyad Mahrez to the Saudi Pro League this summer. Bernardo Silva is also wanted by clubs in the Middle East but would prefer a move to Barcelona. feed But Malcom is now ready to leave Europe and seal a deal to Saudi Arabia, with Al Hilal the club brokering terms. They are ready to pay around    40m for Malcom - the same amount which Zenit first paid to buy him from Barcelona back in 2019. Malcom is set to double his wages his Saudi Arabia and earn close to  Â£350,000-a-week - a figure which would not have been attainable for him in the Premier League or back in Ligue 1. His form last season was impressive enough for him to earn a recall to the Brazil squad and he featured in their recent friendlies against Guinea and Senegal.
