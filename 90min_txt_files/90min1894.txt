Leeds United target Georginio Rutter has arrived in England for a medical after the Whites agreed a club-record deal with Hoffenheim, sources have confirmed to 90min.

Leeds have already dipped into the transfer market to sign Austrian international Max Wober from Red Bull Salzburg, reuniting the defender with his former manager Jesse Marsch.

One of those targets is Moroccan World Cup star Azzedine Ounahi, with talks already held with Angers over a possible deal. The 22-year-old is, however, wanted by a number of clubs from around Europe, including Serie A leaders Napoli and Brendan Rodgers' Leicester.
