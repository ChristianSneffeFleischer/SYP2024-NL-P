Former Bayern Munich president Uli Hoeness has cast doubt over the club's pursuit of Tottenham striker Harry Kane. The German champions first sounded out a move for the England captain in the summer of 2022, with manager Julian Nagelsmann angering Spurs counterpart Antonio Conte when revealing his admiration for Kane publicly. Several Bayern board members have since followed Nagelsmann in freely discussing their high regard for Kane, and Hoeness, who stepped down from official duties in 2019 but remains honorary president, has now chimed in. However, the 71-year-old also expressed his doubt that Kane will make the switch to the Allianz Arena for financial reasons, pointing to Manchester City's failed attempts to sign him in 2021. "He's a great player, but that's an order of magnitude. Manchester City got out at    140m,    150m. I can't imagine that these are amounts that Bayern Munich wants or can pay," he said.
