Tottenham are closing in on the signing of Udinese wing-back Destiny Udogie, 90min understands. The 19-year-old is set to become Spurs' seventh signing of a busy summer window, though will re-join Udinese on loan until the end of the season. 90min understands that Tottenham held off late interest from Brighton, who were keen to take him on loan after failing to agree terms over a permanent deal. However, Spurs' willingness to loan him back to Udinese for the new campaign gave them the edge, and they are expected to pay the Serie A side around    25m in total. The Bianconeri's technical director Pierpaolo Marino revealed on Monday evening that talks for Udogie were ongoing, stating: "There is a negotiation underway and talking about it when there is nothing official yet is very complicated. "It's nice that there is an important offer for Udogie, but Udinese only sells their players for the right amount and tends to keep them for two years. We will try not to deny these parameters."
