Benfica midfielder Gedson Fernandes has been recalled from his ill-fated spell at Tottenham, joining Turkish side Galatasaray on loan until the end of the season instead. The 22-year-old joined the north London club as one of Jose Mourinho's first signings in January 2020, penning a loan deal that was supposed to keep him in the Premier League until the end of the 2020/21 campaign with an option to buy for a whopping    50m. He has failed to impress Mourinho, however, and has made just two appearances this season - in cup ties against Chelsea and Marine.
