Everton are advancing in talks to sign Burnley winger Dwight McNeil, 90min can confirm. The Toffees are in desperate need of attacking reinforcements after selling star forward Richarlison earlier this summer to help ease their precarious financial situation. The likes of Adama Traore, Armando Broja and Maxwell Cornet have been linked with a move to Goodison Park. However, it appears it could be Cornet's Burnley teammate, McNeil, wearing royal blue instead next season. 90min understands Everton have made an offer of around  Â£20m including bonuses, with Burnley happy to accept the fee being paid in instalments rather than in one lump sum. Sources say McNeil is keen to make the move and continue playing Premier League football after the Clarets suffered relegation to the Championship last season. Everton will certainly be familiar with McNeil, who has faced the Toffees eight times across his career - he's only played against Man City on more occasions (nine) - scoring once in a 2-1 Burnley win back in March 2021.
