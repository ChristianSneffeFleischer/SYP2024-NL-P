Mykhaylo Mudryk is undergoing his medical with Chelsea on Sunday morning, 90min understands, with the Blues hopeful of having a deal done before their meeting with Crystal Palace. Chelsea officials flew out to Shakhtar Donetsk's training camp in Turkey on Saturday and hurried through an agreement for Mudryk, who had been of significant interest to Arsenal during the January window. The Blues have agreed a deal worth up to    100m, around    70m of which will be paid up front, while Arsenal's final offer fell marginally short of that asking price. Mudryk is now in London undergoing medical tests and, if all goes to plan, will sign a contract running until 2030. The Ukraine international is expected to be in attendance at Stamford Bridge on Sunday to watch his prospective new employers in action, and sources have confirmed to 90min that Chelsea are hopeful of presenting him to supporters if a deal can be completed in time.
