European champions Chelsea have reportedly shown an interest in Paris Saint-Germain's central defender Presnel Kimpembe, who could be considering his future following the arrival of Sergio Ramos to the French capital.  The former Real Madrid captain's introduction to the side has led Kimpembe to ponder his role within the squad. Over the last few years, the home-grown defender has become a key figure both on, and off, the pitch for PSG and was even bestowed the title of vice-captain.  However, the arrival of such a big personality as Ramos has given Kimpembe doubts and, according to L'Equipe (via Get French Football News), his former manager Thomas Tuchel interested in eventually taking him to Stamford Bridge.  However, interest is all there is at the moment. There are a number of factors which make this transfer difficult. Kimpembe's current deal with PSG takes him all the way to 2024 with the club, while he remains very fond of his boyhood club, with whom he has been since the age of ten and won 19 honours with. As a result, the 25-year old will bide his time and see how his situation at PSG changes because of new addition Ramos. Following Thiago Silva's departure last summer, Kimpembe was a stand out figure for the side, making 40 appearances across all competitions during the 2020/21 season - despite an injury midway through the campaign - and playing a starring role in Mauricio Pochettino's side's progression to the Champions League semi-finals. Furthermore, Tuchel would likely have to sell in order to bring the World Cup-winner to Chelsea, particularly with other business occurring.
