Newcastle United continue to look for more attacking reinforcements and reports have named Atalanta's Duvan Zapata as a possible target. A  £25m deal for Chris Wood has already been struck but Newcastle's plan was always to sign more than one forward and that plan was formed even before star striker Callum Wilson went down with a nasty calf injury. With Wilson sidelined until March, plans are being accelerated for a number of strikers and the Daily Star state that talks have been held with Atalanta over a deal for 30-year-old Zapata. Zapata has bagged nine goals in 16 Serie A games this season but has entered the final 18 months of his contract, and Atalanta are said to be ready to cash in now if the right offer arrives. Newcastle are thought to have suggested a fee north of    30m ( £25m), but Atalanta instead value Zapata at closer to    45m ( £37.6m). The feeling is that negotiations with Atalanta are more exploratory than official, with Newcastle preferring moves for other strikers but searching for viable backups in case they are frustrated in their efforts elsewhere. Benfica's Darwin Nunez is a rumoured target but the Uruguay international is valued at around    60m ( £50m) and Newcastle are yet to commit to paying that sum.
