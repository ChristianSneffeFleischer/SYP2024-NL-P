Barcelona star Robert Lewandowski has confirmed he is not interested in moving to the Saudi Arabia Pro League this summer.  Saudi Arabian clubs have been exceptionally active so far this summer, with Ballon d'Or winner Karim Benzema signing a contract with Al-Ittihad worth a reported  £200m per year after turning down a new deal at Real Madrid and midfielder N'Golo Kante is set to confirm his move to Al-Ittihad soon too.  The pair join superstar Cristiano Ronaldo in the Middle East after the legendary forward signed for Al-Nassr in the winter.  While Saudi clubs have been successful poaching said trio, some other players have opted to turn down lucrative moves to the Pro League. Lionel Messi turned down an astonishing  £344m per year contract offer from Al-Hilal to join MLS side Inter Miami, and now Barca' Lewandowski has confirmed he will not be joining a Saudi Arabian club amid rumours of an offer being tabled.  feed Speaking to Mundo Deportivo about a potential move, the striker said: "There is no issue. So I don't think about it, because why should I think about it if there is no issue? Especially because my contract [with Barca] still runs for a while. I see what is happening [in Saudi Arabia] but it doesn't worry me, because I have other priorities at the moment." Lewa enjoyed an incredibly successful first season at Camp Nou having moved from Bayern Munich during the 2022 summer transfer window.  The Polish international scored 23 La Liga goals and bagged seven assists as Barca won their first La Liga title in four years during the 2022/23 campaign.
