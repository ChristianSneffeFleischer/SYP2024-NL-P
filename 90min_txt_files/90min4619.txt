Bayern Munich have opened talks with Real Madrid's Lucas Vazquez over a summer move with the Spaniard out of contract at the end of the season. Real have struggled to tie some of their key players down to renewed deals recently as they look to balance the books amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, and the utility man looks at risk of joining countryman Sergio Ramos in potentially leaving the club on a free transfer this summer. Vazquez is attracting interest from a number of clubs all over Europe, though it seems German champions Bayern Munich have jumped to the front of the queue to secure his services. AS report that Die Roten have already opened talks with the 29-year-old, though a deal remains some way off at this point in time. The report claims the next few days could be crucial in deciding where Vazquez will be playing next season, with the Spain international keen to pen fresh terms at the Santiago Bernabeu if an agreement can be reached. Vazquez has become a key part of Zinedine Zidane's squad since being promoted from the club's academy and the loss of a player who has been part of three Champions League winning squads would be a bitter pill to swallow. Bild's Tobi Altschaffl has also rubbished the rumours, claiming Vazquez is not the type of player Bayern are looking to sign. However, it may not be all doom and gloom for Los Blancos, with the club reportedly ahead in the running to sign Bayern Munich's David Alaba.
