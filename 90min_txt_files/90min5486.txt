SW6 ?#TosIn pic.twitter.com/FTakWdIaRy Does what it says on the tin, really. Fulham's second centre-back of the night, a very tall man, and still maybe not the Cottagers' last business of the window. ?      ?? #WelcometoParis pic.twitter.com/C8u2Anfmq5 After almost 15 years at the club, Rafinha has left Barcelona to join Paris Saint-Germain. The fee? Somewhere in the region of a bag of beans and a Curly Wurly.  ?? Another Uruguayan arrives at Old Trafford...       Welcome to #MUFC, Facundo Pellistri! Very few of the signings most fans actually wanted, but Manchester United have had a fairly busy deadline day. 18-year-old Uruguayan Facundo Pellistri arrives on a long, long-term deal.  Here's all the info on the signing, with quotes from the kid himself and Ole Gunner Solskjaer. Here's some things to know about him, if he's a new name to you.

Edinson Cavani is a really good footballer, this is a 1+1 deal, Manchester United didn't have a number nine who plays his best football in that spot, and now they do.  He's 33? Who cares. He's good.  All the best, @OrjanHNyland1. ? One year left on his deal, inducing a goalline technology screw-up that kept Villa up     Orjan Nyland has been released by the Midlands club.

Our night's blockbuster deal might not be far away at all. Paperwork to be sorted, but... Rachid Ghezzal has signed a loan deal with Turkish S  per Lig side Be  ikta   until the end of the 2020/21 campaign. The deal of the day? No. A deal that has happened today? Yes.  Ousmane Demb  l   to #mufc is not dead, but complicated. United and Barcelona are studying the possibility of a move without a medical #mulive [sport] Yes, that's where we are at. What could possibly go wrong? Everton moving towards a loan deal with Roma for Olsen https://t.co/nNnB0jGo3c It seems that Everton's fine form has made Man Utd and Spurs reluctant to sell them anyone... even unwanted backup keepers. Enter Robin Olsen. The clock is ticking. ? This deal has been on/off in recent days by Roma have now reached an agreement with Man Utd to sign centre-back Chris Smalling. Fee is    15m +    5m in add-ons.? Details: https://t.co/lvj9uCI6Oc@TheAthleticUK #MUFC #ASRoma https://t.co/wgTrYuRoDU At last!

Turns out Alex Telles was too deep into negotiations to pull out of his move to Manchester United after they lost 6-1 to Spurs yesterday, and now he's a Manchester United player!  Now...Edinson Cavani next? Dare we ask, Ismaila Sarr at some point?         #NUFC are pleased to announce the signing of Rodrigo Vilca from Deportivo Municipal.The 21-year old Peruvian midfielder has put pen to paper on a four-year deal with the Magpies and will initially join up with the U23s.Welcome to Newcastle United, Rodrigo! ?? Newcastle have done a signing! It's not Kylian Mbappe, or a new owner, or Gareth Bale, but it's Rodrigo Vilca!  He     as anyone wearing braces in their announcement picture must     goes into the Under-23s, and if you don't know anything about him? Well, we've got a whole factfile for you right here.  Yep, looks like we're done with players going to Germany for the evening     their window shut a full hour ago at 5pm. Sead Kolasinac, you're a north London man.  For reference, Serie A shuts up shop at 7pm while La Liga and Ligue 1 are aligned with the Premier League's 11pm finish. Isn't that nice?  Striker @carrilloguido9 has today joined @elchecf on a free transfer, after an agreement was reached to terminate his #SaintsFC contract.Wishing you well for the future, Guido. Remember when Guido Carrillo signed for Southampton for like  £19m? And played seven Premier League games? And never scored? Anyway, he's leaving for free with most of a year left on his contract, gone to join Elche. Presumably they were impressed by the one goal he scored in 1210 La Liga minutes last season for Leganes. Good luck at @HerthaBSC, @MatteoGuendouzi ? Well, we've been waiting for this one since about 2pm     the long-haired, young version of Francis Coquelin has left Arsenal for Hertha Berlin on loan.  With only a year on his contract at the end of the season, he and Arsenal will be hoping this goes well enough to prompt a permanent move somewhere.  A new goalkeeper for @Everton: #Olsen or #Romero, talks ongoing @SkySportsPL @SkySportsNews We said earlier that Everton are still looking for a goalkeeper, looks like it's likely to be Sergio Romero or Roma's Robin Olson if someone does come in. Bad day for the dinosaur community, between the Gunnersaurus news and now this for Jordan Pickford and his little T-Rex arms... Oioi. You've all had a lovely time with young Tom Gott today, but it's past his bedtime now. That means that I, Chris Deeley, shall be taking you all the way up to the deadline at 11pm and beyond     until the very last deal is confirmed.  We might be here a while.

Manchester United are looking at Ousmane Demb  l   as an alternative to Jadon Sancho, but according to RMC Sport, the Barcelona man won't be going anywhere this summer.
