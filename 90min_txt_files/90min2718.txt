Leicester City manager Brendan Rodgers has insisted that Wesley Fofana is 'not for sale' despite ongoing interest from Chelsea.  90min understands that Chelsea remain in talks with Leicester over a deal to sign the centre-back and are preparing an improved offer. The Blues have already seen two bids rejected for Fofana this summer, with his current club making it clear that a fee over  Â£80m will be required to prise their star defender away from the King Power Stadium.  When asked about Fofana's potential move to Chelsea during his pre-match press conference on Thursday, Rodgers remained coy over the sale. "The idea is that he is very much a Leicester player. He's not for sale. Unless anything changes, I would expect him to be here," the boss said. "There's nothing new from when we last spoke. We've spoken numerous times they are private conversations. Our communication is normal." Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  &  Toby Cudworth  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Erik ten Hag wanting to sign five players before the transfer window closes, and Man Utd's attitude to selling Cristiano Ronaldo.
