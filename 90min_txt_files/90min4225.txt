Juventus are willing to sell Cristiano Ronaldo for just  £25m this summer as they look to move the Portuguese forward on. The 36-year-old swapped Madrid for Turin back in 2018 as he looked to make it big in another league, having succeeded in England and Spain. While his personal goal contributions have remained excellent, scoring 101 goals for La Vecchia Signora in 133 appearances, Juve have declined and haven't shown any signs of winning the Champions League title he was brought in to help them obtain. As a result, Gazzetta dello Sport report Juve are willing to let the Portugal legend leave for a relative pittance. Ronaldo's departure would also help the Serie A side save as much as  £75m in wages should an exit materialise this summer. Former clubs Manchester United and Real Madrid as well as French giants Paris Saint-Germain have all been linked with moves for the forward, though Juve's director of football Federico Cherubini recently said he does not anticipate an exit this summer. "There has been no sign from Ronaldo about a possible move, and no sign from Juve," Cherubini said, as quoted by Sky Sports. "We are very happy that Ronaldo will rejoin the team once the rest period after the European Championship is over. "Let me reaffirm I'll be happy if he stays."  Juve did manage to salvage an otherwise poor season by finishing fourth in Serie A to qualify for the Champions League. They also won the Coppa Italia and Supercoppa Italiana. United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer did name Ronaldo as a legend he would re-sign for the Red Devils. Back in March, he said: "There   s a few players I   ve played with that I   d love to have in my team, of course.
