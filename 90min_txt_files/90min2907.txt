Former Spain midfielder Cesc Fabregas has joined Serie B side Como on a free transfer from Monaco. The ex-Arsenal, Barcelona and Chelsea star was reportedly considering retirement after leaving the Ligue 1 outfit last month, but has chosen to carry on his playing career by signing a two-year deal with Como. Speaking at his unveiling, Fabregas revealed that he was convinced on the move by club CEO and Chelsea legend Dennis Wise. "I came here to play the best way and win as many games as possible. This is my priority, and if I felt that was no longer the case, I would hang up my boots," Fabregas began. "I want to take Como where they deserve to be, in Serie A. I decided to come here for many reasons. I wanted a project that would give me enthusiasm, I was not interested in the money. Wise was the most convincing and I see a long-term future for this club. "I think this is one of the most important challenges of my career." Listen now to 90min's Talking Transfers podcast, with  Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey,  Harry Symeou  &  Toby Cudworth.
