Newcastle United and Bruno Guimaraes have no intention of parting company anytime soon and the club are not worried by the increasing interest being shown in him, sources have told 90min. The Brazilian has become the cornerstone of Eddie Howe   s plans at the club and has emerged as one of the Premier League   s top midfielders since signing from Lyon. The midfielder only arrived on Tyneside in January, and as 90min revealed earlier this month, plans are already afoot to hand him a new contract befitting of his standing. However, Guimaraes' form has, unsurprisingly, not gone unnoticed by Europe's top clubs. 90min understands that the player   s representatives are fully aware of the interest that is arising, but Guimaraes is neither entertaining or encouraging it. Real Madrid touched base confirming that they were monitoring his situation over the summer, while Liverpool, Chelsea and Manchester City are all following his progress. Scott Saunders  hosts  Graeme Bailey  and  Toby Cudworth  in the latest episode of Talking Transfers. The team discuss Cristiano Ronaldo's Man Utd future, interest in Naby Keita and a decision looming for Harry Kane. Available on  all audio platforms.

But Newcastle believe that Guimaraes is fully committed to the cause and firmly part of the    project    that he was sold on when he first arrived.
