Manchester United reportedly hold a 'serious' interest in Bournemouth's David Brooks and talks over a potential deal could progress rapidly.  Brooks enjoyed a very impressive 2018/19 campaign before missing a large portion of this season due to an ankle injury. However, the Wales international was able to make his comeback when play resumed in June and he went on to feature in each of the Cherries' nine remaining league games.  The 23-year-old wasn't able to stop Bournemouth from being relegated, but as a hugely talented and creative player, his return did aid their push for survival. Since the Cherries' relegation, a number of the club's top players have been linked with moves away - with Nathan Ak   having already joined Manchester City.  Sport Witness now report that Man Utd hold a 'serious' interest in Brooks. The Red Devils have previously been linked with a move for the versatile midfielder, but the latest update claims there could be developments with regards to a potential move 'relatively quickly'.  Brooks could be brought to Old Trafford to improve the squad depth, while Sport Witness also claim that he could be an alternative to first-choice target Jadon Sancho. United remain very keen on landing the Borussia Dortmund man, but it would be 'much easier' to complete a deal for Brooks. United have been linked with a number of alternatives already, with Douglas Costa and Kingsley Coman the most recent two to be suggested. Despite the fact that the Red Devils have opted not to listen to Dortmund's demands with regards to a deadline for the deal, the Premier League outfit remain confident they can strike a deal to sign Sancho.
