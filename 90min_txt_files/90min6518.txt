Juventus and Barcelona are edging towards a part-exchange deal for Miralem Pjanic and Arthur that is tipped to be completed on 30 June, which would have been the official end of the 2019/20 season. Arthur was previously thought to have been reluctant to leave Bar  a for Juve, which was putting the deal on hold. This week, however, the Brazilian has softened his stance which has allowed it to progress to the point of what will soon be a done deal. It is Italian reporter Gianluca Di Marzio who has shared details of the expected 30 June date. Juve official Fabio Paratici commented earlier this week that the date was not important, insisting the time-frame would be set by when the agreements with all parties are reached. But Di Marzio suggests that both players will have signed the deal for it to go through then. That will mean both clubs can register it in accounts for the 2019/20 season. Di Marzio goes on to explain that the deal agreed between the clubs values Arthur at    75m and Pjanic at    60m. Juventus will therefore pay Bar  a an additional    15m on top, which will be made up of a    10m up-front payment and another    5m in related add-ons to follow. It was previously reported that Pjanic had already accepted an offer of personal terms from Camp Nou. Arthur had been offered    5m per season to join Juve, said to be more than twice as much as his current salary in Catalonia, and has been persuaded to move.
