Junior Firpo is the. subject of interest from West Ham and Milan, with Barcelona open to letting him leave the club if they can sign a replacement.  The left-back joined Bar  a back in 2019 but has struggled to dislodged Jordi Alba from the first team since, making just 23 appearances in all competitions last season. His playing time has been even more limited this term with Firpo featuring just 10 times.  Barcelona are willing to let him leave Camp Nou, although not before they have sourced a suitable replacement. According to ESPN, Milan have expressed an interest in taking the player on loan until the end of the season. Their starting left-back, Theo Hernandez, has been in fine form this term, but they have little strength in depth.  The Rossoneri have had quite the season so far     they currently sit top of Serie A by three points, and are keen to cement their position by bolstering their ranks.  However, Bar  a would prefer to sanction a permanent exit with their financial problems well known. This could work in West Ham's favour as it is understood that they favour a transfer, rather than a loan. Aaron Cresswell is the Hammers' first choice left-back, though he has been playing as a third centre-back this season too and like Milan, West Ham have few other options in the position due to Arthur Masuaka's injury.
