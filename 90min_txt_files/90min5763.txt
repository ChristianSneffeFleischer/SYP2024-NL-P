Barcelona are said to have already submitted a    10m ( £7.2m) offer to re-sign central defender Eric Garcia from Manchester City this summer. The Spaniard was part of Barcelona's La Masia, but departed in 2017 to join Man City, where he has risen to the first team.  Garcia initially struggled for minutes under compatriot Pep Guardiola, but impressed in the latter stages of the 2019/20 campaign, starting five of the Sky Blues' final seven league matches.  Guardiola is said to be a big fan of the 19-year-old and has previously openly praised Garcia for his footballing intelligence and ability to read the game. However, now in the final year of his contract, Guardiola admitted in August that Garcia does not want to sign a new deal with the club as he is keen on a move elsewhere - specifically a return to Barcelona.  It has been suggested Bar  a may wait until next summer in order to sign him on a free transfer, but Alfredo Martinez has told El Transistor that La Blaugrana have already made a    10m ( £7.2m) offer to sign him. There is no mention of whether this has been accepted or rejected, but it will likely be the latter as City have previously demanded a lot more than the offer made.   Un sue  o hecho realidad. Muy contento por haber debutado con la @sefutbol ???? toca seguir trabajando para que lleguen m  s oportunidades??
