Fabinho has discussed Liverpool's rumoured interest in Jude Bellingham, stating that he'd be 'happy' if Liverpool brought another number six to the club.  The England international has long been linked with a move to Anfield having impressed in the Bundesliga with Borussia Dortmund since joining the German giants in 2020 from Birmingham City. When asked about the links to midfielders who would all be vying for Fabinho's position in the Liverpool starting lineup, the Brazilian replied: "I didn   t hear too much about transfers. Of course there are always players linked with the club because the club has to look forward and try to be better. "It is normal that good players are always linked with the club. I didn   t hear about Tchouameni. I heard about Bellingham because he is young and a really good player but he didn   t come. It is normal. Liverpool is a big club and wants to keep fighting with the best so it is normal that they will buy new players. "It is normal that they will buy new players and that some players have had their name linked to the club. But it doesn't bother me. I'm really confident. I am really happy here so if Liverpool buy another No.6 that is normal and I will fight for the team and for the position. "I think the midfield is the place where we have more options [than any other department]. I think now we have two or three midfield players with injuries and we still have a lot of options - so although I think I'm not the right man to say whether we need another player or not - but in my opinion we have really good players already in this sector."
