Tottenham Hotspur defender Davinson Sanchez is in talks with several sides over a summer transfer, sources have confirmed to 90min. The centre-back is one of a number of players that Spurs are looking to shift before the end of the window, with 90min revealing back in June that Sanchez could be sold. Sanchez is currently with Tottenham's first team on their tour of Australia and Asia, with club captain Hugo Lloris the only senior player left behind to try and seal a move away. But 90min understands the Colombia international is edging closer to the exit door as Spurs have now granted him permission to talk to interested clubs. French side Strasbourg - who were recently purchased by Chelsea owner Todd Boehly - and Russian outfit Spartak Moscow will enter negotiations with Sanchez, while he also has suitors from Germany. feed Sanchez joined Tottenham from Ajax in 2017 for  £42.5m, which at the time was a club-record fee. He emerged as one of the Premier League's best young defenders in his debut season but has failed to kick on. He was booed off by Tottenham supporters following a poor display in their 3-2 defeat at home to Bournemouth back in April. Nevertheless, Sanchez has made 205 appearances for Spurs and was part of the squad that reached their first-ever Champions League final. Meanwhile, 90min understands that Tottenham intend to loan out 18-year-old defender Ashley Phillips once he completes his  £3m move from Blackburn Rovers. Spurs are set to beat Everton, Liverpool, Manchester United and Newcastle United to his signature. Talks are also continuing with Bayer Leverkusen over Edmond Tapsoba and Wolfsburg regarding Micky van de Ven.
