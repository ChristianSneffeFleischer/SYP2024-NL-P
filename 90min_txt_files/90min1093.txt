Sources have confirmed that it is Brighton who are currently pushing hardest to make a deal happen, however, with the club having recently held talks over a move for Frattesi.  feed Sassuolo have set a price-tag of    40m for their prized asset, a number 90min has been told Brighton are comfortable with.  Speaking to Sky Sport Italia this week, Sassuolo director Giovanni Carnevali confirmed that the best offer currently on the table for Frattesi was from an unspecified Premier League club.     I have not spoken to him about which clubs could be interested," Carnevali explained. "As of today, I am trying to understand what the best opportunity for Sassuolo is, and for the moment that is from a Premier League club.    It is premature to discuss it now, but we will all together try to figure out if there really will be an important proposal from one of these Italian clubs.    The Italian will likely be a replacement for one of Moises Caicedo or Alexis Mac Allister - both of whom are widely expected to leave the club this summer. 90min recently reported that Brighton are set to consider offers for Caicedo this summer, while Liverpool are keen to finalise a deal to sign World Cup winner Mac Allister as soon as possible.
