Chelsea winger Callum Hudson-Odoi is due for a medical with Bayer Leverkusen after agreeing a loan switch for the duration of the 2022/23 season. Hudson-Odoi was seen as the future when he burst onto the scene as an 18-year-old, even commanding strong interest from Bayern Munich that saw Chelsea reject multiple big bids. The England international suffered a devastating Achilles injury in April 2019 but later went on to sign a new long-term contract with Chelsea. But he struggled to establish himself once fit and Thomas Tuchel informed him this summer he was happy for him to leave. The Stamford Bridge hierarchy decided to sanction a temporary move, with a permanent transfer difficult at this stage given there are still two years left on the player   s bumper contract. 90min reported last week that Hudson-Odoi had opted to join Bayer Leverkusen, although was also the subject of interest from Sevilla, Monaco and AC Milan, as well as Crystal Palace, Newcastle, Leicester and Southampton closer to home. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  &  Toby Cudworth  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Lucas Paqueta's potential move to West Ham, Chelsea's plans to sign Anthony Gordon, Wesley Fofana and Arsen Zakharyan and the latest from Old Trafford.
