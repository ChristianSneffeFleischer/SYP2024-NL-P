West Ham are closing in on the signing of Chelsea left-back Emerson Palmieri after agreeing personal terms with the Italian, 90min understands. Last week, the two sides agreed a fee of an initial  £13m, with a further  £2m in add-ons, but personal terms proved a significant issue early in negotiations and the move looked to be at risk of breaking down. After a brief lull, talks resumed and sources have now confirmed to 90min that an agreement has been reached with Emerson to bring the 28-year-old to London Stadium. Emerson is now due to head across London to undergo a medical which, if all goes to plan, will see the left-back become West Ham's seventh signing of the summer - following Alphonse Areola, Gianluca Scamacca, Maxwel Cornet, Thilo Kehrer, Flynn Downes and Nayef Aguerd through the arrivals door, the latter of whom has since been sidelined with a nasty ankle injury. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  &  Toby Cudworth  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Erik ten Hag wanting to sign five players before the transfer window closes, and Man Utd's attitude to selling Cristiano Ronaldo. Available on  all audio platforms  and the  90min YouTube channel. If you can't see the podcast embed, click  here  to download the episode in full! He will come in to provide some much-needed competition at left-back for Aaron Cresswell, who has also been deployed at centre-back to help with an injury crisis which is gradually easing thanks to the arrival of Kehrer and the return to fitness of Angelo Ogbonna.
