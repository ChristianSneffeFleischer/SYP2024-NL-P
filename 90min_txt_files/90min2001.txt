Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti that admitted that the door is open with no hard feelings for any fringe players that wish to the leave the club in the January transfer window. Ancelotti has favoured a relatively settled side so far this season, with 11 members of the squad getting over 1,200 minutes in all competitions. But there are also a handful of big names who have had 500 minutes or less and could be forgiven for growing frustrated. The boss recently explained that new signings in January are not to be expected. But when it comes to potential outgoings, Real are open to letting a few go, especially those who will be out of contract in the next 18 months anyway.    I  want to make one thing clear: I fully trust everyone between now and June.  If they consider that it is best to go out, I will be happy for them,    Ancelotti said on Monday. AS has reported there are five players in particular that Real would be willing to sanction departures for within the next few weeks. Among them is Eden Hazard, who has never been able to justify his    100m transfer from Chelsea in 2019. The Belgian has a contract at 2024 but is 31 and has only made six appearances in all competitions all season, spending most of the campaign sitting on the bench.
