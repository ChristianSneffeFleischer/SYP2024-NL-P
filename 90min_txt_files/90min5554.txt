Saint-  tienne have confirmed that they've reached an agreement with Leicester City for the transfer of young defender Wesley Fofana.  The Foxes were understood to have made a fourth bid for the French centre-back amid their desperate search for defensive reinforcements, with a fee in the region of    35m (plus    5m in add ons) finally agreed.  Deal agreed between St Etienne and Leicester for Wesley Fofana     35m Euros + 5m in bonuses. Great signing. He is a very talented young player. In a statement put on their official website, the French club confirmed Fofana's imminent departure, saying: "AS Saint-  tienne reached an agreement on Tuesday evening with Leicester, the current leader of the Premier League, for the transfer of their defender Wesley Fofana.   "The amount of this transfer is the largest ever obtained by the club. "The decision to sell the player was taken collegially by the Management Board and the shareholders.  ASSE accepted Leicester's exceptional offer, especially given the uncertain economic context caused by the health crisis." Fofana joined Saint-  tienne in 2015 as a 14-year-old before emerging through the youth ranks and making his debut for the reserve side in 2018. The 19-year-old was then thrust into Claude Puel's first-team plans last season and frequently impressed in his 14 Ligue 1 appearances alongside Arsenal new-boy William Saliba. Fofana particularly stood out in his side's narrow defeat to Paris Saint-Germain in the French Cup final in July; a contest which highlighted the centre-back's supreme talent.  Thus, Saint-  tienne concluded their statement with the line: "At only 19 years old, he is now considered one of the greatest French talents of his generation."
