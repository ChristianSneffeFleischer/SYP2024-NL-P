Jurgen Klopp has said that 'all decisions are made by me' when discussing Liverpool's pending sale of Jordan Henderson to Saudi Pro League club Al-Ettifaq. 90min reported earlier this week that Al Ettifaq had agreed to pay  £12m plus add-ons to sign Liverpool captain Henderson this summer at the behest of the Saudi club's new manager Steven Gerrard. Henderson has also agreed personal terms on a  £350,000 per week deal over three-years to make the move to the Middle East.  With the move nearing completion, the midfielder was left out of the Liverpool squad which eventually saw off Karlsruher 4-2 - having actually gone behind in the game - and speaking after that win to the press, Klopp hinted that he made the decision to sell Henderson this summer. "There's actually nothing to say. As long as things are not really finally decided, we don't have to talk about it. There will be a moment where we probably have to talk about it, but it's not now," Klopp began. feed "I don't know that anything is decided, which means nothing to say in the moment. But that's even better for you because you can speculate, which is much more fun! If I say something then it   s finished! "In the end, all of these decisions are made by me. And because I respect the players a lot, it's usually [with their] consent. It was in this case, and it is all fine." Along with Henderson, fellow Liverpool midfielder Fabinho is also set to complete a mega money move to Saudi Arabia in the coming days. The Reds and Al Ittihad have agreed a  £40m deal for the Brazilian, and official confirmation of the move is expected soon.
