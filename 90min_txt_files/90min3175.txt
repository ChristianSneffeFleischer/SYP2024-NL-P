Fulham have agreed a deal to sign Manor Solomon on a season-long loan from Shakhtar Donetsk, 90min understands, with the deal also including an option to buy. The Cottagers have been chasing Solomon for some time and they initially believed they had reached an agreement all the way back in April. However, things have been complicated since with Fulham reluctant to commit to spending on a player who may be available for free in the near future.  Not only does the Ukrainian Premier Liga remain suspended due to the ongoing war with Russia, but Solomon's current deal is also set to expire in December 2023.  As a result Fulham have been haggling over a deal for some time, but 90min understands that they have finally agreed to take Solomon on loan with the option - not an obligation - of making the switch permanent.  Solomon has carved out a solid reputation in recent years, netting nine Premier Liga goals in just 23 games last season. He has also earned 31 caps for Israel and is capable of playing on either wing. Listen now to 90min's Talking Transfers podcast, with  Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey,  Harry Symeou  &  Toby Cudworth.
