Juventus have agreed a    80m fee with Barcelona for midfielder Arthur Melo, with Maurizio Sarri keen to build his midfield around the Brazilian, in a deal which is likely to be followed by Miralem Pjanic going the other way for around    10m less.  Arthur has made 26 appearances in all competitions for Barcelona in 2019/20, but he has been linked with a move away. Serie A giants Juventus and Inter have continued to show an interest in him for a while, despite the fact that the Brazilian has made it clear he wishes to stay at Camp Nou.  BREAKING: Juventus have agreed a  £72.5m fee with Barcelona to sign Arthur. Sky Sports now report, however, that I Bianconeri have agreed an    80m fee with Barcelona for the midfielder. Despite his reservations about leaving Bar  a, Juventus hope to persuade him. Manager Sarri is keen to build his midfield around Arthur in a similar way to how he did with Jorginho during his time at Napoli and Chelsea.  Juventus have offered the 23-year-old    5m a year in wages, which is significantly more than he currently earns at Barcelona. However, despite a fee being agreed, Arthur's preference is still to remain at Barcelona and fight for his place.  As has been reported for a while, Juventus' Pjanic could head in the opposite direction, although there are complications to this. Pjanic is said to be valued at around    70m, but Sky Sports' report states that Barcelona do not feel Pjanic is worth just  £9m (   10m) less than Arthur.
