Aston Villa are confident of signing Tammy Abraham this summer despite interest from a number of top clubs around Europe, 90min understands.  The 25-year-old is into his second full season at AS Roma after joining the club from Chelsea for a reported  £34m fee in 2021, and has scored 25 Serie A goals during his time in the Italian capital. Eight of Abraham's goals have come during the 2022/23 campaign, and he scored a crucial goal at the weekend to earn Jose Mourinho's Roma a 1-1 draw with UEFA Champions League semi-finalists AC Milan at the Stadio Olimpico.  It was a goal that was witnessed by a number of top clubs from around Europe, with 90min understanding that Manchester United, Chelsea, Arsenal, Tottenham, Newcastle, Paris Saint-Germain and Bayern Munich all sent scouts to watch the game. Abraham is understood to have been the 'centre of attention' for many of those clubs, but sources have told 90min that Aston Villa remain confident of signing a player who fired them to promotion to the Premier League during a hugely successful 2018/19 loan spell - 90min first reported the Villans' interest in February.

Abraham scored 25 goals in 37 Championship appearances for Villa, before returning to parent club Chelsea to become first choice under the management of Frank Lampard. To facilitate a move though, Villa will likely need to stump up at least  £40m for Abraham, which would break the club's transfer record - Emiliano Buendia is currently their record acquisition in a deal that could eventually be worth  £38m to Norwich City. Sources have further confirmed to 90min that Abraham was not the only player attracting attention during the game, with defensive midfielder Sandro Tonali of interest to Chelsea, Arsenal and Tottenham, and Rafael Leao under the watchful eye of Chelsea and PSG - the Portuguese international is expected to stay at Milan, however, and is closing in on a new contract.
