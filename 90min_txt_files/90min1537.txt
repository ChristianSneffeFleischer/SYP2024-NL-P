Chelsea's abundance of first-team midfielders contributed to their failure to secure a work permit for Brazilian midfielder Andrey Santos, 90min understands. The 18-year-old, who joined in an  Â£18m deal from Vasco da Gama in winter, was initially rejected for a permit as the league he was coming from, Brazil's second tier, was not deemed a high-enough level to warrant a permit. Chelsea waited until after the South American Under-20 Championships, in which Santos played a starring role in Brazil's triumph, to lodge an appeal to the decision and there was significant confidence that the midfielder would be granted a permit this time around based on his international campaign. However, sources have confirmed to 90min that Santos' run to glory was not taken into consideration by the Exceptions Panel, who have again rejected Chelsea's request. With Santos' prior club experience not enough to earn a permit, Chelsea had to make a case arguing that the teenager is a significant talent who would be 'indispensable' to their squad. It was ruled that Chelsea have enough central midfielders to cope without Santos. The Blues already have N'Golo Kante, Denis Zakaria, Enzo Fernandez, Mateo Kovacic, Conor Gallagher, Ruben Loftus- Cheek and Carney Chukwuemeka in their senior setup, while young Lewis Hall is also a midfielder by trade despite most of his first-team experience coming at left-back.
