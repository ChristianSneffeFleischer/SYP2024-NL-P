Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson has completed his move to Saudi Pro League side Al Ettifaq. The England international has reunited with Reds legend Steven Gerrard, who recently decided to take up Al Ettifaq's offer to become their new manager. 90min first revealed at the start of July that Gerrard wanted to bring in former teammate Henderson as one of his first signings. And Henderson has now put pen to paper on a contract with Al Ettifaq, bringing an end to his 12-year stay at Anfield. The midfielder posted a lengthy farewell message to fans on Wednesday and received his own parting statement from Liverpool, who wished their former captain well after he helped inspire one of the club's most successful periods. manual "As his Anfield chapter now comes to a close with a move to Al Ettifaq in Saudi Arabia, everybody at Liverpool Football Club wishes to place on record their thanks and gratitude for everything Jordan Henderson did for the club during his 12 years as a Red," the club's long statement ended. Henderson signed for Liverpool in 2011 from Sunderland, though struggled to make much of a good impression during his first few seasons on Merseyside. He emerged as one of their key players under Brendan Rodgers during the 2013/14 season in which they just missed out on the Premier League title, and he was handed the captain's armband following Gerrard's departure in 2015. Henderson leaves Liverpool having won eight trophies - including seven as captain - and having made 492 appearances for the club, scoring 33 goals.
