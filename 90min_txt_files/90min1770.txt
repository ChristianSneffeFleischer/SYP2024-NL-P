Tottenham Hotspur are open to allowing Djed Spence to leave on loan before the end of the January transfer window, sources have told 90min. Spence signed for Spurs in the summer from Middlesbrough after a prolonged transfer saga, but head coach Antonio Conte insisted at the time that he was a 'club signing' and has since only used him for 41 minutes this season. The 22-year-old has not made Tottenham's matchday squad for their last three Premier League games, while he is yet to make a start in Spurs colours. His longest cameo lasted 25 minutes in a 2-0 Carabao Cup loss at Nottingham Forest. Conte's refusal to use him more often is a damning indictment considering the largely subpar performances of Emerson Royal and Matt Doherty, while his rare introductions from the bench at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium are often met with loud cheers. While Tottenham remain in talks with Sporting CP over wing-back Pedro Porro, 90min understands they are now also prepared to let Spence leave on loan in search of game time for the rest of the season. Listen now as  Scott Saunders  hosts  Graeme Bailey and  Toby Cudworth  to discuss the latest transfer news. On today's agenda: Dusan Vlahovic, Anthony Gordon, Enzo Fernandes, Amadou Onana, Malo Gusto, Nicolo Zaniolo, Pedro Porro, Weston McKennie, Milan Skriniar, Maiximo Perrone & more!
