Chelsea's social media accounts have teased that Mykhaylo Mudryk is on the verge of signing from Shakhtar Donetsk. Arsenal have long been interested in the Ukraine winger and have been in extensive talks with Shakhtar over a fee over the last month. The Gunners have failed to meet Shakhtar's asking price, which they have continually pointed to as in the same ballpark as sums paid by Man Utd for Antony and Man City for Jack Grealish. Though Arsenal were long in the driving seat for Mudryk, 90min reported on Saturday evening that Chelsea had swooped in and hijacked the deal. A fee has been agreed with Shakhtar and the 22-year-old is on his way to England to finalise personal terms and undergo a medical. After Shakhtar confirmed a transfer to Chelsea was close, the Blues teased the deal on their social media accounts.

Over on Instagram, Chelsea have encouraged users to follow Mudryk in a post featuring him celebrating, while his own social media handle has been placed in the club's bio.
