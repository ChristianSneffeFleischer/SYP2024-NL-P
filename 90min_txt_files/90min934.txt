Liverpool have confirmed the signing for World Cup winner Alexis Mac Allister on a long-term contract.  The 24-year-old was a key target for the Reds this summer as they hoped to bring some fresh blood into their aging midfield, and they have moved quickly to get their man.  Mac Allister underwent a successful medical on Tuesday, with Liverpool keen to tie up a deal for the talented Argentina before he went off on international duty later in the week, and the deal has now been confirmed. "It feels amazing," said Mac Allister after completing his move to Anfield. "It   s a dream come true, it   s amazing to be here and I can   t wait to get started. "I wanted to be in [from] the first day of pre-season, so it   s good that everything is done. I   m looking forward to meeting my teammates. feed "It was a fantastic year for me     World Cup, what we achieved with Brighton     but now it   s time to think about Liverpool and try to be a better player and a better human being every day."
