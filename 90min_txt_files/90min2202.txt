RB Leipzig defender Josko Gvardiol has confessed he would like to join Real Madrid later in his career, describing the La Liga giants as 'the biggest club in the world'. Gvardiol has attracted serious interest from across Europe this summer, with sources confirming to 90min that Chelsea are locked in negotiations with Leipzig over a double deal to land the centre-back alongside teammate Christopher Nkunku. Chelsea remain hopeful that they are close to winning the race for Gvardiol, who recently left the door open to a move to Stamford Bridge, but co-owner Todd Boehly is aware of competition from elsewhere, including from Real. Asked about a possible move to Madrid shortly after confessing he could join Chelsea, Gvardiol did not shy away from heaping praise on the Spanish side. "Real Madrid is the biggest club in the world, so who knows? Maybe one day I can play there," he told reporters. "I would like to, yes."
