Manchester United loanee Odion Ighalo is attracting interest from clubs in Qatar and Saudi Arabia, with his Old Trafford deal set to expire at the end of the month.  Ighalo initially joined the club he supported as a child in January last year, a move that was widely criticised as a panic buy at the time. Despite these doubts he turned out to be a solid contributor, registering five goals and an assist in 19 appearances last season.  This was enough to convince United to extend his loan stay beyond the end of last season but he has barely featured during the current campaign. The arrival of Edinson Cavani has pushed the Nigerian down the pecking order with his only starts coming in the early rounds of the EFL Cup.  According to Sky Sports, his time with the Red Devils will come to an end on 31 January and his next move could take him to the Middle East. Clubs in Qatar and Saudi Arabia are both said to be interested, while Ighalo is not against returning to his parent club, Shanghai Shenhua, where he is under contract until December 31.  Several Premier League clubs have also made tentative enquiries about the striker and although he is willing to listen to offers, it would be a surprise to see him remain in England.
