Leicester City are keen to pursue their interest in January target Jannik Vestergaard, with the Foxes hopeful of signing the  £25m-rated Southampton centre-back in the summer transfer window.  Brendan Rodgers' side are on the brink of Champions League qualification for the 2020/21 campaign, and the Northern Irish coach is aware that he will need to strengthen his squad with the demands of domestic and European duties looming.  And according to Danish outlet Ekstra Bladet, Vestergaard is at the top of Leicester's shopping list for the summer, having already attempted to sign the  £25m-rated 27-year-old in January.  Vestergaard also previously admitted that he came close to switching clubs last winter but Saints coach Ralph Hasenhuttl blocked the move, with the team in the middle of a fierce relegation battle.  he said: "I was close to a change of clubs last winter, but the club and the manager said they would keep me. "At this stage I have not talked to the club about next season and about the future, so I do not know what can happen." The former Borussia Monchengladbach star has suffered at the hands of his coach's rotation policy this campaign, making only 14 league appearances, and it is believed that Southampton are willing to cash in on the defender this summer, with only two years remaining on his current contract.
