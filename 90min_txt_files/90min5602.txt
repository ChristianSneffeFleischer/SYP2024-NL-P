Crystal Palace are willing to let Christian Benteke depart the club this summer, with the Belgian striker touted for a return to his homeland. Benteke's future has been thrust into doubt after the Eagles moved to sign Chelsea forward Michy Batshuayi on loan.  Back in the ?????? Red and Blue. #ItsAPalaceThing pic.twitter.com/T8p3OjLTxn With Benteke failing to reach his impressive 2016/17 heights as of late - scoring just six goals in his last 71 Premier League appearances - it appears that Palace are finally ready to part ways. Belgian news outlet Walfoot reports that Benteke 'no longer has a future' at Palace and they understand he'll be allowed to leave Selhurst Park this summer in a loan deal with an option to buy or a permanent transfer.  Turkish giants Fenerbahce are interested in a move for the 29-year-old but it's Belgian Pro League outfit Club Brugge who have emerged as the frontrunners for Benteke's signature and are looking to secure a deal for around    5m.  Negotiations are thought to be going well between the two clubs regarding the transfer, although it remains unclear what the Belgian himself desires.  The Palace striker enjoyed spells at Standard Liege, Kortrijk and Mechelen before settling at former club Genk in 2011. The 2011/12 season saw Benteke score ten times in 22 league games as he grabbed the attention of Premier League side Aston Villa, who brought him to Villa Park in the summer of 2012 in a deal worth almost  Â£8m.
