Newcastle United have reached agreement with AC Milan over midfielder Sandro Tonali, sources have confirmed to 90min. The Magpies dispatched sporting director Dan Ashworth and chief scout Steve Nickson to Italy on Tuesday to push through a move and they are heading home from Milan with a deal in place. 90min previously confirmed that Tonali was open to moving to St James' Park after Newcastle made their initial move over the weekend - he has now agreed to sign a six-year contract after spending three years at San Siro. Tonali will now undergo a medical in Romania - where Italy are based for the European Under-21 Championships - before putting pen to paper on his contract. Sources close to Milan have told 90min that the overall deal is worth    70m ( Â£60m) including add-ons - which would make Tonali Newcastle's second most expensive signing of all time, following on from last year's capture of Swedish forward Alexander Isak. Tonali will become Newcastle's first major signing of the summer as they aim to bring in another four new faces for manager Eddie Howe.  It is understood that on top of the Tonali deal, Newcastle want to sign a new right-sided central defender, a full-back, a wide forward and a number 10. They are hoping the latter will be James Maddison, who is also wanted by Tottenham, and talks have already taking place with Leicester about a prospective deal.
