Despite the pandemic severely impacting match day revenue and club finances, Voller insisted Leverkusen were under no pressure to sell Havertz, and admitted they would happily keep him at the club for another season. "What makes Kai Havertz so interesting is the fact that he embodies world class in four or five positions," Voller added. "Of course we would be very happy if he stayed for another year. It is clear that the departure of such a player, despite the high transfer fee, always means a loss - see Leipzig and Werner. "There is nothing new in this regard, and we are still very relaxed about it."
