Barcelona manager Xavi Hernandez has called on the club to sign more players during the summer transfer window. Barca have signed fours players this summer thus far, with three of said signings available to play for the club at the start of the 2023/24 season - Brazilian starlet Vitor Roque has also signed but will not arrive at Camp Nou until 2024.  The club signed Oriol Romeu, as a replacement for Sergio Busquets, for  Â£5m from La Liga club Girona, while the other two acquisitions made were free agents Ilkay Gundogan and Inigo Martinez.  Speaking after Barca's impressive 3-0 win over Madrid in Dallas, Texas, on Saturday night, manager Xavi addressed the club's lack of spending this summer, and revealed that he has informed Barcelona president Joan Laporta of the need to strengthen the first-team squad: "I think are lacking [a few players]. We have to strengthen ourselves a little more. The president and the sports management know it. To be competitive we have to strengthen ourselves. "I believe a lot in this team, but I think we need something more. My pending task as a coach is to compete more there. We don't hide. It's one of the objectives of the season."
