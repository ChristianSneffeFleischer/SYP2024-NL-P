Memphis Depay has completed his move from Barcelona to Atletico Madrid, penning a two-and-a-half-year contract. The 28-year-old arrived at Camp Nou in the summer of 2021, following the expiration of his Lyon contract, and signed a two-year deal. But the Dutchman was never able to command a regular place in Barcelona's side and his opportunities have been further limited this season after Robert Lewandowski's arrival from Bayern Munich. Memphis has only played in four games in all competitions during 2022/23 and it was no secret that Barcelona were willing to let him go if an interested party was willing to take on his hefty wages. That willing party has proven to be La Liga rivals Atletico Madrid, who have completed the signing of Memphis in a deal worth just    4m.
