It's not been an easy ride for Barcelona supporters in recent weeks, so let's bring them some...good news(?), shall we?  That's right, club legend and world's greatest footballer Lionel Messi may have had enough of the politics and drama behind the scenes at Camp Nou, but there is one man who la Blaugrana fans may not have seen the back of just yet.  Mundo Deportivo reports that although new coach Ronald Koeman might have told Luis Suarez to pack his bags, and informed Messi that his days of running the show at Bar  a are over, he is hoping to keep hold of one particular striker.  Martin Braithwaite. Yes, you have read that correctly. The Danish striker, who joined the club in February as a last resort, desperate, emergency, loophole signing, may not have played his final game for los Cules.  It was expected that the 29-year-old would be offloaded in the summer, having only signed from Leganes as a replacement for injured duo Suarez and Ousmane Dembele, it is believed that Koeman is prepared to give the forward a chance to impress in training before passing any judgement on his future.  The Dutch boss has received good reports on the striker's efforts and ability in practice, and he wants new coach Henrik Larsson to pass his own judgement on the forward before deciding to ship him out. Koeman sees Braithwaite's experience as invaluable in La Liga, and he could be a key member in the side if he is surrounded by youth and untested strikers.
