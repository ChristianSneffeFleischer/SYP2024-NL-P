Southampton are not interested in selling in-form striker Che Adams despite interest from Premier League rivals Everton. Reports this week have circulated linking the Toffees with a move for the Scotland international, who has started the season in fine form. Adams has netted braces in his past two games - wins against Leicester and Cambridge in the Premier League and Carabao Cup respectively. The Mirror claimed Everton want Adams as a replacement for Chelsea target Anthony Gordon, but 90min understands Saints are not interested in letting him leave. Manager Ralph Hasenhuttl was similarly dismissive of any potential exit during his pre-match press conference for Southampton's clash with Manchester United at St Mary's on Saturday, quipping: "He's our player and we definitely won't sell him." On the striker's form, he added: "He had a big impact after coming on. He showed against Cambridge he can score goals. It's a sign of him feeling confident." Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey,  Toby Cudworth  and  Harry Symeou  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Antony attempting to push through a move to Man Utd, Frenkie de Jong and Pierre-Emerick Aubayemang's futures at Barcelona and Arsenal's interest in Pedro Neto.
