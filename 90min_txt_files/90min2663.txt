Leicester City manager Brendan Rodgers has confirmed the club have rejected a third Chelsea bid for defender Welsey Fofana. Chelsea have been continuing talks with Leicester over a deal, but a fresh offer has now been shunned by the Foxes. Leicester have been sticking firm to a price tag of at least  £80m for the France Under-21 international, who has made it clear to Rodgers and the club that he wants to move to west London. However, Chelsea's latest offer or around  £70m is still substantially below Leicester's expectations and the Foxes are still not prepared to sell at the figure. The situation has moved on though, with Rodgers confirming that the club have also demoted Fofana to training with their Under-23 side after he missed a session last week - which had already resulted in him being dropped for their Premier League loss to Southampton at the weekend. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey,Toby Cudworth  and  Harry Symeou  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Antony attempting to push through a move to Man Utd, Frenkie de Jong and Pierre-Emerick Aubayemang's futures at Barcelona and Arsenal's interest in Pedro Neto.
