Chelsea are in talks with Monaco over a deal for French centre-back Benoit Badiashile, 90min can confirm. A left-sided centre-back is a top priority for Chelsea and the Blues have been locked in discussions with RB Leipzig over Croatian star Josko Gvardiol since the summer, but his outstanding World Cup has seen the 20-year-old's stock rise. With Gvardiol's asking price flying up and teams from across the globe voicing their interest in the defender, Chelsea's attempts to strike a quick deal have so far proven fruitless, with the German side happy to wait until the summer to agree to a sale. Chelsea are looking for immediate help in defence and sources have confirmed to 90min that talks are on with Monaco over a deal for 21-year-old Badiashile. The France Under-21 international, who has well over 100 appearances for Monaco, has long been watched by a number of sides across Europe and Chelsea were among those to consider a move during the summer. Now, talks have been held over a move which would see Badiashile move to Chelsea in the January window to offer immediate help to a Blues backline that has kept just four Premier League clean sheets this season. Listen now as  Scott Saunders  hosts  Graeme Bailey  and  Toby Cudworth  in the latest episode of Talking Transfers. This week they discuss Man Utd   s ongoing interest in Dutch duo Cody Gakpo and Frenkie de Jong, Josko Gvardiol   s future, Gabriel Martinelli and more! Available on  all audio platforms.
