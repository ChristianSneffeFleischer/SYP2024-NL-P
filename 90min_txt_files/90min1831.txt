Brighton are determined to keep hold of Moises Caicedo this January, sources have told 90min. The 21-year-old has emerged as one of the top young midfielders in world football in the last couple of seasons and is now being looked at closely by a host of clubs. Caicedo was very highly-rated as a youngster and shocked many when he opted to join Brighton ahead of the likes of Manchester United when he left Ecuador in 2021. He is impressing with regular first-team football, though has played fewer than 50 Premier League games. Big spending Chelsea are huge admirers which is no surprise given they not only have former Brighton boss Graham Potter in charge but also a host of backroom staff who played a huge part in Caicedo's progress. Man Utd, Liverpool, Arsenal and Newcastle all have Caicedo on their radars and are expected to battle for his signature if and when Brighton show signs of wanting to sell the Ecuadorian. However, 90min understands that is not now. Sources have told 90min the club do not envisage any situation this month that would convince them to even contemplate a deal. The Seagulls are also in a strong situation with Caicedo's contract as it runs until 2025.
