Brighton & Hove Albion are in talks with Chelsea over a summer move for Conor Gallagher, sources have told 90min. The Seagulls are in the transfer market for midfielders having sold Alexis Mac Allister to Liverpool, while the in-demand Moises Caicedo could also leave the club this window. Their search has led them to England international Gallagher, who played 45 times for Chelsea during their dismal 2022/23 season. He arrived back at Stamford Bridge following an impressive loan spell at Brighton's rivals Crystal Palace, winning the club's player of the year award. The Eagles' results and performances notably dipped after his departure. 90min understands that Brighton view Gallagher as an ideal replacement for Mac Allister, and the 23-year-old would be keen to work with Roberto De Zerbi and play in the club's maiden Europa League campaign. The Seagulls believe they have a strong chance of finalising a deal, while they would be open to selling Caicedo to Chelsea with Gallagher used as a makeweight. feed Gallagher is naturally a central midfielder but was utilised as a number ten and a withdrawn centre forward by Chelsea caretaker manager Frank Lampard towards the end of the season. Brighton are not the only other Premier League side interested in Gallagher. He is on Newcastle United and West Ham United's respective midfielder shortlists, while Tottenham have been keen in the past but are believed to be prioritising a move for Leicester City's James Maddison. Gallagher may not be the only player to leave Chelsea in the coming weeks. 90min understands that Manchester United are interested in Mason Mount though have had a  Â£40m bid knocked back by the Blues, while Kai Havertz has emerged as a surprise target for Arsenal.
