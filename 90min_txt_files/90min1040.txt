Manchester United could walk away from a deal to sign Marcel Sabitzer on a permanent deal due to Bayern Munich's asking price, sources have told 90min. The Austria international emerged as a surprise target for the Red Devils at the back end of January, with a six-month loan being finalised on the final day of the winter transfer window. Sabitzer's versatility came in handy for Man Utd during the second half of the 2022/23 season and he became a valuable member of the squad. 90min reported in April that Erik ten Hag wanted to keep the 29-year-old having been impressed by him in his brief time at Old Trafford. However, 90min understands that Man Utd and Bayern's valuations of Sabitzer are far apart and a permanent transfer could fall through. READ MORE FROM THE 90MIN TALKING TRANSFERS TEAM feed Man Utd had been hoping to seal a deal for around  £10m, with 90min previously reporting that the German champions would command a fee similar to the  £13.7m they paid to RB Leipzig in 2021 for him. But Bayern have since changed their stance and are now looking for a sum north of  £20m. Ten Hag remains keen on keeping the midfielder at the club but has accepted that money set aside for this deal could be better spent elsewhere, while Sabitzer was hopeful that a transfer could be completed and had expected it to go through. Man Utd remain in the market for a midfielder, with 90min recently reporting of their interest in Mason Mount. The England international is set to sit down with Chelsea this week to discuss his future at Stamford Bridge. Adrien Rabiot of Juventus, who came close to signing for Man Utd last summer, remains a target. His contract in Turin expires at the end of June though talks are ongoing over a fresh deal. LISTEN NOW
