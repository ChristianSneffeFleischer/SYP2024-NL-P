Son Heung-min has been left frustrated by Tottenham's decision to sign Richarlison this summer, as the South Korean believes signing a new left-sided forward was the wrong move. Ecuador midfielder Moises Caicedo remains on the radars of Liverpool and Arsenal, with Brighton prepared to sanction a sale in January for the right price. Liverpool could move for Caicedo if they lose either Naby Keita or Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, both of whom are considering their futures at Anfield after failing to make Jurgen Klopp's Champions League squad. Barcelona remain confident of signing Gavi to a contract extension, though interest from Manchester City, Manchester United, Chelsea, Liverpool, Bayern Munich, Juventus and PSG remains. Both Chelsea and Manchester United will continue to monitor Frenkie de Jong's game time at Barcelona, with a January bid on the cards if the Dutchman continues to start games on the bench. A new defensive midfielder will be Chelsea's priority once the January transfer window opens and the Blues are expected to return for Ajax's Edson Alvarez, who wanted to make the move to Stamford Bridge in the summer. Antonio Rudiger's agent has claimed Chelsea made "next to no effort" to keep the 29-year-old at Stamford Bridge. Instead, the German joined Real Madrid on a free transfer.
