Manchester United are hopeful of finalising the arrival of goalkeeper Andre Onana in time to take the Cameroon international to Oslo to kick-start their pre-season tour, 90min understands. United have seen a second bid, worth    50m, knocked back for Onana but are confident of reaching a full agreement in the near future. Inter had demanded    60m but the two sides are expected to meet in the middle somewhere. Talks between the two clubs have continued and progressed to a point that United are beginning to plan for Onana's imminent arrival. United are understood to be hopeful of reaching a full agreement to sign Onana over the weekend and sources have confirmed to 90min that the plan is to take the 27-year-old to Oslo when their pre-season tour begins on July 12. A friendly against Leeds United is on the cards, seven days before a meeting with Lyon in Edinburgh, Scotland. feed United are in need of a new starting goalkeeper this summer after David de Gea confirmed his departure from the club on Saturday. De Gea had been offered the chance to stay at United with a drastic reduction to his previous  Â£375,000-a-week wages but the 32-year-old will now take his talents elsewhere, leaving United needing a new starter for the first time in 12 years. On the books currently are returning loanee Dean Henderson, who is of serious interest to Nottingham Forest, and 37-year-old Tom Heaton. Inter could look to reinvest any money earned from Onana's departure in Chelsea striker Romelu Lukaku. The Blues will only listen to permanent offers for the Belgian and talks are ongoing between the two sides.
