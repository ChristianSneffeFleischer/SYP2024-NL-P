Arturo Vidal  has hinted that he is interested in a potential move to Inter due to his good relationship with Antonio Conte. The Barcelona midfielder is one of the most decorated players in world football, having won eight consecutive league titles with Juventus, Bayern Munich and most recently the current Spanish champions. However, Vidal has played more of a bit part this season, starting just eight games as a result of the fierce competition for places in the Barcelona midfield, and triggering speculation that he could leave the club at the end of the season. Speaking to El Periodico, the Chile international admitted he wants more game time at Camp Nou in order to feel valued. "Here I am happy and I have excellent teammates, but I want to feel important," Vidal said. "Otherwise, I will have to look for something else to continue my career. "I like playing, I don't say all the games, but the most difficult and important ones to win the titles."

Vidal spent three years playing under the Italian at Juventus, winning three Serie A titles in the process. On Conte's reported interest in him, Vidal added: "We have an excellent relationship, he knows that I am a winner and that he can trust me. That's what I want here." The midfielder is poised to return to action with Barcelona on Saturday evening, as they get their La Liga defence back underway with a trip to Mallorca.
