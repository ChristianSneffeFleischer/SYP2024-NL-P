Arsenal are keen on signing Lyon talisman Houssem Aouar this summer, but the Gunners must first offload some of their own stars before making a move for the midfielder. The 23-year-old has caught the eye for the Ligue 1 side again this season and his performances in the 2019/20 edition of the Champions League were evidence that he can deliver on the biggest of stages. According to ESPN, Arsenal are one of several clubs monitoring Aouar this summer in case the opportunity to sign the Lyon man arises. In fact, he could be available for as little as    25m, should his club decide to cash in. However, the north London outfit will have to sell some of their own stars before attempting to sign the France international, as they are in dire need of reducing the wage bill and generating some income from player sales.  Matteo Guendouzi has already left the Emirates for Marseille, while Granit Xhaka and Lucas Torreira are both expected to depart this summer. Mikel Arteta's determination to overhaul the midfield means he will also be looking to add some fresh faces to the centre of the pitch, especially after Martin Odegaard and Dani Ceballos returned to Real Madrid at the end of their loan spells. These outgoings could make space for the arrival of a new midfielder, and while Arsenal have been linked with a move for Renato Sanches - who said he was 'awaiting' the Gunners' 'invitation' - the name of Aouar is now on their radar, too.
