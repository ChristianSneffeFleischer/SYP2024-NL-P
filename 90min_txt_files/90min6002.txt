Manchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer will sanction the departure of Diogo Dalot this summer in an effort to trim his squad for the coming campaign, with Everton and Paris Saint-Germain keen to take over the burden. Burden of what, though? Truth is, it's hard at this point to know how good Dalot is, considering his two years at Old Trafford have been beset with injuries and a general lack of playing time.  It feels good to be back on the pitch?? Moving forward to the Semi Finals?      ?FA Cup @manchesterunited A post shared by  Diogo Dalot (@diogodalot) on Jun 27, 2020 at 1:08pm PDT Boasting cover at full-back, it appears as if Dalot has been made surplus to requirements, with fellow Premier League outfit Everton thought to be keen alongside PSG. That's according to the ever-reliable Portuguese outlet O Jogo - tongue firmly in cheek - although in their defence, there is nothing to suggest this won't follow through. At right-back, Timothy Fosu-Mensah looks set to be retained as backup to Aaron Wan-Bissaka, but while Dalot can play on either side of defence, Luke Shaw and Brandon Williams have the starting and substitute spots at left back nailed down. Over on Merseyside, Carlo Ancelotti is on course for a considerable overhaul of his Toffees side as he seeks to put his stamp on Goodison Park. Dalot could provide competition for the likes of Lucas Digne and Seamus Coleman. Thrown into the mix are Barcelona - because why not? - who are likely only included given that they were the ones beaten to the chase by United when he joined from Porto for a fee of  Â£19m in 2018.  That can be the only reason, since Bar  a are up the proverbial creek both financially and structurally at present. Thus, forking out a decent sum on a player who's made just 34 outings in two seasons would be beyond foolish. Even for them.
