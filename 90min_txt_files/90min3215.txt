Nottingham Forest have confirmed that young forward Brennan Johnson has put pen to paper on a new contract. The 21-year-old excelled in the Championship last season, racking up 16 goals and nine assists in 46 appearances as Forest secured promotion back to the Premier League. As well as shining at club level - he won the Championship Young Player of the Season award - Johnson also emerged as a key player for Wales, who he helped reach the World Cup in Qatar later this year.    Just wanted to say that firstly the support that I   ve felt from the fans last season was unbelievable," Johnson said upon signing a new four-year contract. "Playing for Nottingham Forest in the Premier League was always my dream growing up and now it   s going to happen.     It has been an unbelievable journey from the Academy to the first team and I want to thank the manager, all the staff and the whole board for believing in me and giving me the confidence to go out on the pitch and show what I can do.     I   m really excited for this new season and feeling the energy from the fans out on the City Ground which I   m sure will be something special.
