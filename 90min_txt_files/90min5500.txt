Paris Saint-Germain are likely to lodge an increased bid for Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Dele Alli before Monday's transfer deadline. Alli has managed just 45 minutes of action in the Premier League this season, with Jos   Mourinho controversially leaving the Englishman out of his matchday squads for several games across competitions. Mourinho has gone on record saying he's 'convinced' Alli will still be at Spurs by the time the transfer window closes, although it is believed that they wouldn't say no to a loan offer which meets their financial demands. According to The Telegraph, PSG are eager to get a deal over the line and are ready to increase their bid. They have already seen two offers knocked back - the latest of which included a loan fee of around  £4m - but they are ready to go a little higher. Unfortunately for PSG, they still have some way to go before they meet Spurs' demands. It is believed that Mourinho and chairman Daniel Levy are looking for somewhere closer to the  £8m mark to loan out Alli, and it's unclear whether PSG would agree to go that high. Mourinho is not determined to see the back of Alli, who he famously described as 'lazy' during the club's All or Nothing docuseries. Instead, he hopes to have thrown down the gauntlet to Alli, encouraging him to work hard and improve. However, Alli is understood to have made it clear that he is keen to find a new challenge this summer, which has made things a little awkward for Spurs. Should Alli leave Spurs, a loan is accepted as the most-likely option. He's a 24-year-old goalscoring midfielder with four years remaining on his contract, and Spurs have referenced all that when it comes to negotiations over his value.
