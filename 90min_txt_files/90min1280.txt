Chelsea have a renewed sense of optimism over further contract talks with midfielder Mason Mount, 90min understands, which could deliver a fresh blow to Liverpool's transfer plans. Mount is approaching the final 12 months of his current deal and has been warned that he will be sold this summer if he continues to reject the chance to extend, with Liverpool leading a number of Premier League sides in pursuing his signature. As 90min reported in March, the lines of communication between Mount and Chelsea have never collapsed and sources have confirmed that another round of negotiations has been scheduled for the coming weeks. Chelsea are on the hunt for a new manager to replace the recently departed Graham Potter and 90min understands that the Blues, who have always remained confident about their chances of retaining Mount, believe their new plans are impressive enough to convince the academy graduate to stay. Bosses with experience at the highest level, including Julian Nagelsmann, Luis Enrique and Mauricio Pochettino, are all under consideration as part of an intense recruitment process which Chelsea's decision-makers are determined to get right, and there is a renewed confidence that Mount will share that ambition and positivity.

An agreement remains some way away but Chelsea still believe they can convince Mount to stay and recently hinted at a willingness to agree to a shorter contract, having tied left-back Ben Chilwell down to a four-year deal instead of the usual six, seven or even eight years which have been handed out to various players across the season. Chelsea's renewed optimism comes as another blow to suitors Liverpool, who have identified Mount as a top midfield target after accepting defeat in the race to sign Borussia Dortmund midfielder Jude Bellingham. Liverpool lodged their interest with Mount's representatives early on amid fears that a change in Chelsea's direction could alter their stance in negotiations with the 24-year-old, and Jurgen Klopp's side will now face a nervous wait to see whether Chelsea can finally get an agreement over the line.
