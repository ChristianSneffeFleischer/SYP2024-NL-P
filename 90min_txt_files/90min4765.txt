Bayern Munich have confirmed they have reached an agreement to sign RB Leipzig centre-back Dayot Upamecano once the summer transfer window opens. The 22-year-old was widely expected to leave the club at the end of the season once his  Â£38m release clause becomes active, and Bayern swooped in early to beat Liverpool and Chelsea to his signature.        #FCBayern have agreed to sign Dayot #Upamecano from 1st July 2021 ?? https://t.co/h1HtzEKVDG#MiaSanMia After Upamecano signalled his intention to join Bayern talks over personal terms accelerated quickly, and Bayern have now taken to their official website to confirm that the Frenchman has penned a five-year contract with the German giants.    We are happy that we were able to sign Dayot Upamecano for FC Bayern Munich," said sporting director Hasan Salihamidzic.  "Dayot will be a very important component for our team in the coming years, we are convinced of that." Upamecano's arrival at the Allianz Arena could be part of a major defensive shakeup for Bayern, who could lose no fewer than three of their current centre-backs at the end of the season. Both David Alaba and Jerome Boateng will be out of contract once the campaign comes to a close, while Niklas Sule will enter the final year of his deal and is expected to be added to the transfer list if he does not extend his stay. Chelsea have been named as potential suitors for all three of those defenders - interest which may grow now that Upamecano is off the market - but there are countless other sides who are thought to be on the lookout for new defenders this summer. Real Madrid are understood to be leading the race for Alaba, while the likes of Liverpool, Barcelona, Manchester United and Paris Saint-Germain are all expected to pursue new centre-backs once the season comes to an end.
