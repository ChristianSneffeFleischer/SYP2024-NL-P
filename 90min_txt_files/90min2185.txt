Valencia have opened contract talks with United States midfielder Yunus Musah in an attempt to fend off mounting interest from the Premier League in the 20-year-old. Musah, who came through the Arsenal academy and was eligible to represent England before committing to the USMNT in 2020, impressed at the World Cup as Gregg Berhalter's side made it to the last 16, where they were eliminated at the hands of the Netherlands. A regular at club level with Valencia, Musah has long been on the radar of Premier League sides after his record-breaking start to life in the first team two years ago. Arsenal have been tracking his development ever since he left their academy in 2019, but now sources have confirmed to 90min that both Chelsea and Liverpool have made contact with Musah's representatives to register their interest in a transfer. With Valencia struggling down in tenth place in La Liga this season, Musah has been identified by Premier League scouts as a possible transfer target. Yet the Spanish side are understandably determined not to lose their most valuable youngster. Indeed, Valencia have moved to open talks with Musah over a new contract to replace his previous deal, which runs until 2026 and includes a release clause of    100m.
