Erling Haaland's father has revealed the striker is keen to test himself across each of Europe's top five leagues, suggesting he may not stick around too long at Manchester City. The Norwegian was wanted by most of the game's elite sides last summer but ended up joining City from Borussia Dortmund, where he racked up 86 goals and 23 assists in just 89 appearances in all competitions. With Germany ticked off his list, Haaland is tearing it up in England to the tune of 14 goals in just ten games, and now the striker's father, Alf-Inge, has admitted he wants similar records across Europe before he hangs up his boots.    I think Erling wants to test out his capabilities in every league," he said in Viaplay's new documentary, Haaland: The Big Decision. "Then he can stay in every league for three to four years maximum.    He could have two-and-a-half years in Germany, two-and-a-half in England, and then in Spain, Italy, France, right?    We do not know if it will be like that, but I think he would like to test his abilities in the big leagues.
