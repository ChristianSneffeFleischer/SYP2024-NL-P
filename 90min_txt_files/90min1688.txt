Davinson Sanchez has hinted at a Tottenham exit in the near future, stating he does not want to "disappear" due to a lack of first team football. Colombia international Sanchez joined Spurs in 2017 for what was then a club-record fee and enjoyed a successful first season playing alongside the likes of Jan Vertonghen and Toby Alderweireld.  While he captained Tottenham in the FA Cup win at Preston on Saturday, Sanchez has largely slipped out of favour under Antonio Conte. His only appearances in January so far have been the two domestic cup wins over Portsmouth and North End.    I'm really happy [to be captain],    Sanchez told  Standard Sport.    You wait for these types of moment, more when you are at the club for as long as I've been. I'm very thankful to the boys for being behind me.    Definitely [it has been a frustrating period]. As a player, especially at my age and knowing that I'm very capable to play in this team, I think when no game time comes it   s very hard. You're an international player as well, and looking at that situation. You don't want to disappear out of football.

If not, I'll wait for my moment and then maybe there's a decision to take. I have to show that I'm professional enough to face this situation."
