Tottenham have denied receiving an opening bid from Bayern Munich for striker Harry Kane and have no intention of selling this summer, sources have told 90min. Bayern ended up not directly replacing Robert Lewandowski last summer when he was sold to Barcelona and have continued to keep tabs on Kane, who is about to enter the 12 months of the six-year contract he signed back in June 2018. 90min understands that Real Madrid are keeping an eye on Kane   s situation, having seen Karim Benzema opt to join Al Ittihad in the Saudi Pro League. Manchester United are also interested in the striker but have backed away from anything formal in the belief that Spurs will refuse to sell. Paris Saint-Germain have additionally shown interest, with Spurs also expecting attention to come from big-spending fierce London rivals Chelsea. feed Bayern are the first club to put forward a bid for Kane, who turns 30 next month. 90min understands it is a  Â£60m (   70m) package that includes add-ons, although Spurs have denied receiving a bid and are adamant any such offer would be rejected anyway. Crucially, from their perspective, chairman Daniel Levy does not want to sell and remains convinced he can persuade Kane to stay. Indeed, the belief across Europe in recent months has been that Kane won   t be sold this summer, although Bayern are at least testing the waters with regard to that theory. Kane has been informed that Spurs aren   t prepared to entertain bids, despite being no closer to agreeing a new contract. But there remains a belief at the club that he could sign a fresh deal. Kane was back to his best for Tottenham in 2022/23, scoring 30 Premier League goals to equal his best ever league haul, with only a record-breaking campaign from Manchester City   s Erling Haaland denying the England captain a record-equalling fourth Golden Boot.
