Manchester City defender Kyle Walker is yet to make a firm decision on his future as Bayern Munich, Sheffield United and West Ham all show interest in the 33-year-old, 90min understands. Walker has just completed his sixth season at City following a 2017 transfer from Tottenham, capturing his fifth Premier League winner   s medal, as well as a second FA Cup and a first Champions League title     the latter wrapped up an historic treble. He was ruled out through injury for a couple of months prior to the 2022 World Cup break, but was a key player throughout 2023 and even captained the team on a number of occasions. But Walker, having played all 180 minutes of the Champions League semi-final against Real Madrid, was only a late substitute in the final against Inter. 90min understands that surprise snub annoyed the player and is a significant factor in considering his future. feed Ideally, City want to keep him and are open to a possible contract extension beyond his current deal that expires at the end of next season. But the club will equally not stand in Walker   s way should he want to leave and would be prepared to sell in that scenario. Talks with Bayern have already taken place. But Sheffield United, the club Walker joined at the age of seven and for whom he made seven senior appearances before being poached by Tottenham at 19, are also keen following their promotion back to the Premier League. West Ham are a third club keeping a close eye on the player with strong interest. As 90min recently revealed, Saudi Arabia could be also be a lucrative option.
