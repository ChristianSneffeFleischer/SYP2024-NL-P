Manchester United are interested in a potential deal for Bayern Munich midfielder Corentin Tolisso this summer, with a French report suggesting the club have already started discussions with his representatives. They aren't alone in registering their interest for the Frenchman, however, with Inter also tempted by the player as they pursue midfield reinforcements of their own. Tolisso has struggled to make a significant impact at Bayern since moving from Lyon in 2017, and journalist Mohamed Bouhafsi of RMC Sport reports that the German giants are willing to let him go for an offer in the region of    35m. The 25-year-old has stalled in recent months, only managing 24 appearances in all competitions this season after falling out of favour under new Bayern manager Hansi Flick. United are likely to be one of the most active participants in a coronavirus-impacted transfer window this summer, and are in pursuit of Borussia Dortmund's Jadon Sancho as their primary target. They are also pursuing the likes of Jack Grealish and Jude Bellingham, though are battling with Borussia Dortmund for the latter. Tolisso, an attacking option who can also play box-to-box, seems an inevitable option given his availability. Inter, meanwhile, have been linked with a plethora of midfielders in recent months.
