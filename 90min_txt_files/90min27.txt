Everton have finalised a deal to bring in Leeds United winger Jack Harrison on a season-long loan, sources have confirmed to 90min. The former Manchester City and New York City winger will join Everton for the 2023/24 campaign after activating a clause in his contract following Leeds' relegation from the Premier League. Aston Villa also made a move for Harrison, but upon learning that he would not be fit for another six weeks, they backed away from a deal - Villa are looking at options in the transfer market having lost Emi Buendia to an ACL injury and they wanted someone who could make an immediate impact. Harrison passed a medical with Everton on Sunday but he does have a hip problem that will likely see him sidelined until after the September international break. feed Everton turned to Harrison after accepting defeat in their pursuit of his teammate Willy Gnonto. The Italy international agreed personal terms over a move to Goodison Park, but Leeds would not allow him to leave. Gnonto was one of the few Leeds players in their squad that did not have some sort of release clause, unlike Harrison. Harrison is the latest Leeds player to depart the West Yorkshire giants this summer after returning to the Championship. Rodrigo, Robin Koch, Max Wober, Tyler Roberts, Joel Robles, Brenden Aaronson, Rasmus Kristensen and Marc Roca have all departed the club.
