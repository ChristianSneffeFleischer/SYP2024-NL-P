Tottenham Hotspur duo Juan Foyth and Ryan Sessegnon will leave White Hart Lane on season-long loan deals this window, with Villarreal and Hoffenheim close to securing their respective services.  The pair have seen their game time severely limited in north London, and they have hardly featured since the arrival of Portuguese coach Jose Mourinho last year.  Foyth fell down the pecking order following the emergence of Japhet Tanganga, and the signing of Real Madrid left-back Sergio Reguil  n has cast Sessegnon further down the chain of command too.  Mourinho is also hoping to trim his squad ahead of the transfer deadline, allowing him to work with a select group of stars as they push to reclaim a place in the top four. So, the duo look set to depart the club in search of first-team action, and Fabrizio Romano reports that deals are close for both players.  Centre-back Foyth is nearing a loan move to Spanish side Villarreal, although the Yellow Submarine were able to negotiate a    15m buyout clause for the Argentine, should he convince them to make the deal permanent at the end of the season.  The 22-year-old was tipped to become a Premier League star upon his arrival to the top flight, but he has struggled to nail down a regular starting place, and has failed to gain the trust of coach Mourinho. Despite Spurs' leaky backline, Foyth only managed four league appearances last season, and he hasn't taken to the field since the turn of the year.
