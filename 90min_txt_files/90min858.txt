Kim Min-jae has turned down the offer a new contract at Napoli that would have removed his release clause, 90min understands. Napoli are hoping they can persuade Kim to stay beyond the summer transfer window, but Manchester United, Newcastle, Paris Saint-Germain and Bayern Munich are all keen on landing him. 26-year-old Kim only joined Napoli last summer to replace Kalidou Koulibaly, and he made an immediate impact as he was voted Serie A defender of the year, helping the club to their first Scudetto since 1990. When Napoli signed Kim from Fenerbahce, they had to swoop fairly late in the window to beat Rennes to a deal. As part of frantic negotiations, they agreed to put a release clause in Kim's deal which would allow him to leave for    50m in the first two weeks of July. Napoli are desperate to keep Kim given the impact he had in his maiden campaign and have offered him a new contract, which would include significant pay rise but also remove this clause. Sources have confirmed to 90min that the defender does not want to agree to this stipulation. feed Kim's representatives are continuing to hold talks with numerous suitors. It is believed their preference would be to join Man Utd, who are very much in the market for a new defender as they look to move Harry Maguire on. Premier League rivals Newcastle, who can also offer Champions League football, and PSG have also made contact with his camp in recent weeks. Kim is currently back in South Korea undergoing part of his mandatory military service, but he is due back in Europe by July.
