Barcelona have confirmed the permanent transfer of midfielder Carles Alena to Getafe, although the Catalans do hold a number of options and clauses with regard to the player   s future. Alena was born in the nearby town of Mataro and joined La Masia when he was just seven. The young talent progressed through the youth ranks, making his debut for Barcelona B at 17 and his first-team debut aged 18 just over a year later in 2016. The rising star went on to make 27 first-team appearances during the 2018/19 campaign but failed to kick on and spent the latter half of the 2019/20 and 2020/21 seasons on loan at Real Betis and Getafe respectively. His Getafe move has now been made permanent. The transfer is thought to have brought in around    5m, as well as removing Alena   s salary from the wage bill, which was also a key aspect of his loan. Barcelona   s statement confirms that they will pocket 50% of any future transfer fee should Getafe sell him on. They also retain a buy-back option that could see him return to Camp Nou in future and a first refusal on any offer that Getafe might receive. Alena, now 23, made 43 senior appearances for Barcelona in total. His final games for the club in the second half of last season even saw him wear the legendary number six previously occupied by Xavi. The day before Alena   s exit was confirmed, Bar  a sealed the signing of teenage Austrian international forward Yusuf Demir. The 18-year-old has initially arrived on loan from Rapid Wien but the deal includes a    10m option to make it a permanent transfer next summer.
