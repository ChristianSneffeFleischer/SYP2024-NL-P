A car park tour of the United Kingdom, interviews conducted through car windows and yellow ties - there's nothing quite like transfer deadline day, is there? It's set to be an exciting January this year, with a mid-season World Cup holding the potential to dictate business throughout the transfer window.  Of course a much shorter window than that in the summer, clubs have just 30 days to conduct their business. The January transfer window will open, as usual, on 1 January for Premier League and EFL clubs, as well as teams in Scotland. The same is true for sides in Germany and France, although Italian and German clubs will have to wait until the day after to start bringing their players in. It's going to be especially key for sides to stack their squads with suitable talent as soon as possible this year due to a packed calendar. The World Cup has forced an incredibly physically demanding schedule upon most clubs, so doing business early will be particularly important this time around. That business will have to be completed in just 30 days, as the window closes on 31 January at 23:00 (GMT) for Premier League clubs. EFL clubs have the same deadline, while teams in Scotland will have until 23:59 (GMT) to finalise those deadline-day deals. 31 January is also the final day of the window across Europe, although the deadline has been set at 17:00 (GMT) in the Bundesliga and at 18:00 (GMT) in Serie A. We've already seen Cody Gakpo make a high-profile switch as he swapped PSV for Liverpool following his impressive performance at the World Cup. The tournament was a breakout opportunity for many players, with names like Sofyan Amrabat and Azzedine Ounahi attracting serious attention for their respective contributions to Morocco's compelling campaign.
