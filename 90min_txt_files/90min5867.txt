Newcastle are close to signing Galatasaray defender Marc £o with a deal entering the final stages of negotiations, according to a report in Turkey. The transfer rumour mill has seen Newcastle linked with a number of defenders throughout the summer, but the latest is that a deal for the 24-year-old Brazilian is nearing completion. Turkish newspaper Aksam report that the Magpies are closing in on Marc £o in a deal worth    19m ( £17m) with a 10% future sell on clause for Gala inserted into the contract. Newcastle had initially offered    22m, but the Turkish giants are insistent on the sell on fee being added in, which resulted in the adjusted fee. Talks are now progressing 'positively' between the two clubs for the left-sided centre back - who only joined Galatasaray in January 2019 - and it is expected that the offer will be accepted, as Gala are eager to reinforce their squad with their own transfers before the window closes. The reports follow on from speculation that began linking Marc £o with a move to Tyneside at the weekend, with some noticing that the defender has recently followed Newcastle's official Instagram account. Make of that what you will. Marc £o had previously been linked with a move to Serie A with Atalanta and even with fellow Premier League side West Ham in March, before the coronavirus pandemic halted football. The Brazilian, yet to be capped by his country, would reinforce Steve Bruce's backline and allow him to comfortably play with three central defenders, which he did often last season.
