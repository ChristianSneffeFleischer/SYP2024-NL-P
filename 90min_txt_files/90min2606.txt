Ruben Neves has confessed that he did not expect to still be a Wolves player at this point in the summer. The 25-year-old ended last season with a confession that he may have to leave Molineux to fulfil his dream of playing Champions League football, with no shortage of European giants interested in signing him. Arsenal, Barcelona and Manchester United have all tracked Neves, and 90min understands that Liverpool scouts have been impressed by the Portugal international as part of their search for late-window reinforcements. Wolves are keen to convince Neves to sign a new contract, but in an interview with The Times, the midfielder admitted he does not yet know what his future holds.    Well, let   s see what happens," he said.    I try to focus 100% on my football and I had a good start to the season but we need results now. If you ask me at the end of last season I would have said to you,    I will leave    but I   m still here, so we never know what   s going to happen.
