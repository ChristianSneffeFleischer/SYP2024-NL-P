Al Nassr are confident that they will win the race to sign Wilfried Zaha this summer, 90min understands. The Ivorian's deal with Crystal Palace is up in the summer and he is available on a free transfer. 90min previously reported that the Eagles were eager to keep Zaha in south London and had tabled him a club-record contract offer worth over  Â£200,000-a-week. Zaha had, however, planned on prioritising a move to a club competing in the UEFA Champions League, with Atletico Madrid and Marseille prepared to offer him such a prospect. He has also been approached by Qatari outfit Al Sadd. But sources have told 90min that the contract on the table from Al Nassr has blown Zaha's other offers out of the water and they are confident of completing a deal. Should Zaha accept, he will become a teammate of Cristiano Ronaldo. Various high-profile players are swapping Europe for Saudi Arabia this summer. Karim Benzema's move to champions Al-Ittihad was confirmed on Tuesday evening, while Lionel Messi is still weighing up an offer from Al Hilal. Meanwhile, sources have told 90min that ex-Arsenal forward Alexis Sanchez will head to Al Fateh, while Benzema will be joined at Al-Ittihad by out-of-contract Wolves winger Adama Traore. 90min also understands that Lucas Moura, who will leave Tottenham on a free transfer this summer, is also in talks with numerous Saudi clubs.
