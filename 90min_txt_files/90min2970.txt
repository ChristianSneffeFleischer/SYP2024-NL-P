Cristiano Ronaldo and his agent Jorge Mendes have arrived at Manchester United's Carrington training ground for talks about the forward's future.  Ronaldo did not travel with the rest of the squad for their pre-season tour due to 'family reasons', though prior to that he had informed the club to consider any reasonable bids for him this summer.  90min understands that the 37-year-old's position has not changed, with Mendes currently exploring options to take his client back to a Champions League club.  Chelsea and Bayern Munich have been linked in the past, while a sensational switch to former foes Atletico Madrid has been touted more recently.  On Tuesday morning, Ronaldo and Mendes were photographed arriving at United's training ground ahead of talks about the player's future. Reports elsewhere later claimed that former manager Sir Alex Ferguson has also travelled to Carrington.  90min understands that although Ronaldo does still want to leave, he would not refuse to play for Erik ten Hag should the Dutchman call upon him.  Sources have also indicated that despite the lack of interest in Ronaldo currently, there is a belief that a move away is likely - with United abandoning their sale of Anthony Martial as losing both players would leave them short up front.  90min has been told that one of the options being discussed on Tuesday is a loan move. However, prior to Ronaldo's temporary exit, United would want him to sign a one-year contract extension - his current deal expires at the end of the season.
