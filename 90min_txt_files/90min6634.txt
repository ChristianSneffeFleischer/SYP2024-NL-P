Bournemouth winger Ryan Fraser is likely to turn down a new contract with the Cherries in order to protect his chance to sign for a new club before next season. The 26-year-old has been subject to interest from a number of Premier League sides in the last 12 months and will leave Bournemouth for free this summer as it stands. 90min exclusively revealed last month that Arsenal, Everton and Tottenham are all monitoring his situation, and are preparing to offer the Scottish international a contract. With Bournemouth locked in a relegation battle as the Premier League season resumes, they have been negotiating contracts with a number of first-team players in order to see them through to the new expected end of the season.  The Daily Record reports that Fraser is expected to turn down his chance to sign a short-term deal with the club, in fear of losing out on his big move. His contract is currently set to expire on 30 June. The report also notes that manager Eddie Howe wants to keep Fraser at the club and that the Cherries haven't given up hope on convincing him to re-sign, despite the deal looking unlikely. Crystal Palace are also interested in his services, and have been watching him 'extensively'. Fraser has been training with the squad since teams were allowed to resume preparations for the return of football, but rejecting the short-term contract would mean that Bournemouth will lose his services after their first two returning games against Palace and Wolves.
