Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy is holding firm to his asking price for Serge Aurier, as AC Milan try to bring the right-back to San Siro. Spurs paid  £23m to prise Aurier away from Paris Saint-Germain back in 2017 and are keen to recoup that fee in full, with Levy unwilling to drop his asking price for a player in his prime years.  Despite this, the Daily Mail report that Milan are trying to negotiate a lower fee, with the Italians tabling offers of around  £12m.  The Ivorian full-back has been a divisive figure during his three-year spell in north London, but established himself as the first-choice right-back at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium last season. The former Ligue 1 champion arguably had his most impressive campaign on English shores to date, producing two goals and eight assists in all competitions.  Levy, a notoriously tough negotiator, is not prepared to take a major financial hit, especially in the current climate. Spurs are working on a tight transfer budget after missing out on Champions League football, and the coronavirus pandemic hit their finances hard.
