Juventus are confident of finalising a deal to sign Nicolo Zaniolo from AS Roma this week, 90min understands.  The creative midfielder scored six goals in Roma's successful UEFA Europa Conference League campaign last season, having returned to the squad following a second serious ACL injury. After a year of proving his fitness, Zaniolo has now set his sights on a move away from I Giallorossi this summer. 90min understands that Juve are heavy favourites to sign the Italian international, and they believe they can finalise a deal within the next week.

Zaniolo had been linked with a move to Tottenham in recent months as well, and Roma even held talks with the Lilywhites, but the player's preference to stay in Serie A has meant that La Vecchia Signora became the frontrunners in the race to sign the player.
