Southampton are close to agreeing a deal for Luton right-back James Bree, 90min understands. In turn, the Championship side are on course to replace Bree with Cody Drameh from Leeds. Bree, who has primarily been operating as a wing-back and occasionally a right-sided centre-back, has started all 27 of Luton   s Championship fixtures so far this season as the Hatters seriously challenge for a place in the second tier playoffs. 25-year-old Bree started his career at Barnsley and later joined Aston Villa while still a teenager when the club was in the Championship. He moved on to Luton, initially on loan, in 2019 and has been a regular at Kenilworth Road ever since. Southampton have already been active in this transfer window with the signings of Mislav Orsic and Carlos Alcaraz in a bid to boost their Premier League survival hopes. In addition to closing in on an agreement for Bree, talks have also been held with Rennes over Ghana international winger Kamaldeen Sulemana.
