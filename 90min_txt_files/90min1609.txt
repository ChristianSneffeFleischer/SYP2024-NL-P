Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has confessed he does not understand how Chelsea managed to navigate financial rules to embark on the biggest shopping spree in January history. The Blues spent close to  £300m on Enzo Fernandez (a reported target for Liverpool), Mykhailo Mudryk, Noni Madueke, Benoit Badiashile, Andrey Santos, Malo Gusto, David Datro Fofana and six months of Joao Felix, having spent something similar during the summer. No team in history has spent more in a single season than 2022/23 Chelsea, whose January spend was more than La Liga, the Bundesliga, Serie A and Ligue 1 managed combined, and Klopp admits he does not know how the Blues managed it. "I say nothing without my lawyer," Klopp joked when asked about Chelsea's spending spree. "I don't understand this part of the business, but it's a big number. They are really good players, so congratulations. I don't understand how it's possible, but it's not for me to explain how it works." Klopp's comments come shortly after La Liga president Javier Tebas lashed out at the Premier League for distorting the transfer market. English sides spent a reported  £815m in January, while Spain's top flight saw just  £25m worth of business.
