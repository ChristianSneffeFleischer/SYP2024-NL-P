Wolves winger Adama Traore is in talks with Italian sides Atalanta and Napoli over a Bosman transfer, sources have told 90min. The Spain international's contract expires at the end of the season and he is able to talk to foreign clubs regarding a free transfer. 90min understands that Traore has held talks with Atalanta and Napoli regarding a summer move. La Dea have been handed a huge boost in their quest for Champions League qualification following Juventus' 15-point deduction, while Gli Azzurri lead the Serie A standings by nine points from champions Milan. Traore is also still admired by Tottenham, who came close to signing him last January before rejoining boyhood club Barcelona on loan. Spurs' plan for Traore had been to use him as a makeshift wing-back, though he is now believed to prioritising clubs who would utilise him in his natural right wing position. Wolves manager Julen Lopetegui was recently asked about Traore's future and if it was possible he could still sign a new contract with the club, replying: "We have talked about this, he is our player and we are happy with him. This is all. "His commitment is fantastic, sure." He added: "Adama is one player that has one specific condition and quality. He has to be able to take advantage of this condition, of course. "We have to help him to understand and put the right situation on the pitch to help him."
