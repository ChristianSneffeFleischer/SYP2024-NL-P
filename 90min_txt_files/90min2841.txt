Barcelona coach Xavi has admitted he doesn   t know whether Frenkie de Jong will still be at the club by the time the summer transfer window closes but is hoping that the Dutchman stays. De Jong has been pursued for the last few months by Manchester United, with Chelsea also progressing in talks for the former Ajax star more recently. United have agreed an    85m deal with Barcelona but encountered a significant setback over an estimated    20m still owed to De Jong by the Catalan giants in deferred wages. United had considered contributing to paying off that sum in order to push things through, before Chelsea then came on the scene. Barcelona are looking to sell to raise funds and space on the wage bill that will allow them to register the new signings that have come in this summer. De Jong himself remains happy and settled in Spain.    I don't know what will happen to Frenkie de Jong. Until August 31 anything can happen       Xaxi said about the ongoing saga.    He knows what I think and what the club want and need. Of course I'm counting on him, he's a great player.
