Leeds United are close to finalising a deal to sign Marseille forward Bamba Dieng, 90min understands. The Whites were among the suitors of PSV forward Cody Gakpo who were left disappointed by the Dutch side's decision to keep hold of the 23-year-old in the early hours of Thursday morning. With the clock winding down, Leeds are now looking at alternatives and sources have confirmed to 90min that they have made an aggressive push to land 22-year-old Dieng from Marseille. 90min reported earlier this summer that numerous Premier League sides had expressed an interest in Dieng, who has nine goals to his name from 42 appearances with Marseille's first team. Everton, Fulham and Nottingham Forest have all made contact with Dieng's representatives about a possible deal, but 90min understands that it is Leeds who have made progress with their pursuit of the young forward. Dieng is now due to head to Leeds for a medical ahead of putting pen to paper on a long-term contract. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  &  Toby Cudworth  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Lucas Paqueta's move to West Ham, Chelsea's plans to sign Anthony Gordon, Wesley Fofana and Arsen Zakharyan and the latest from Old Trafford.
