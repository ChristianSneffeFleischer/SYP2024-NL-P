Al Nassr are waiting to hear if Cristiano Ronaldo has agreed to join them, but they remain confident that he will, sources have told 90min. The Saudi Arabian outfit have made a world record breaking offer to the Portuguese legend, which 90min revealed last month would make him the highest-paid footballer of all time. Ronaldo left Manchester United by mutual consent last month after he criticised the club's owners, the Glazers, manager Erik ten Hag, and the attitude of the club's young players during an explosive interview with Piers Morgan. Reports in Spain have suggested that Ronaldo has already agreed the move to Saudi, but sources have told 90min that the decision has not yet been made, although they did acknowledge the confidence from Al Nassr was well placed.
