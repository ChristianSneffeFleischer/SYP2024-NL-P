Spurs are reported to be plotting a move for Arsenal utility man Ainsley Maitland-Niles, because transfer silly season is in full swing and there is no stopping it.  While Willian was recently added to the long list of players to move between Arsenal and Chelsea, the intensity of the north London derby means moves from Spurs to the Gunners, or vice versa, are far less common.  But while a move for Maitland-Niles would hardly shake the London footballing landscape in the same way Sol Campbell did back in 2001, The Mail are ambitiously claiming that the 22-year-old is on the radar of Jos   Mourinho's team, and could make a  Â£20m switch in the weeks ahead.  Having been given his debut by Ars  ne Wenger in 2014, Maitlaind-Niles has gone on to make exactly 100 appearances for the Gunners.  He spent last season in and out of the team, but defensive injury crisis meant he became an increasingly important player for Mikel Arteta. He started the FA Cup final on the left of a back five, earning himself a winner's medal in the process. Whether that will be his last appearance for the club he has served since childhood remains to be seen, but it's suggested that Spurs are keen to secure some competition for Serge Aurier, while they also value the youngster's impressive versatility.  With Arsenal open to selling their academy graduate to raise funds, a move doesn't seem like the most ridiculous thing in the world - though it would depend on Maitland-Niles willingness to move his current club's arch rivals.
