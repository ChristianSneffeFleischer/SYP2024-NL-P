Manchester United have reportedly agreed a fee with Porto for left-back Alex Telles, with a medical to take place on Sunday evening ahead of the transfer's official announcement.  With just 18-year-old Brandon Williams available as cover for the injury-prone Luke Shaw, United have been keen to recruit a new established left-back all summer. In loaning Diogo Dalot out to AC Milan, the club freed up more space in the position, with Telles seen as the preferred candidate to fill the void.  A deal was reported to be 'close' towards the end of September, but a deal looked in jeopardy, with the two clubs failing to find common ground over Telles' valuation.  ? Sky sources: Alex Telles to @ManUtd is a done deal! Total agreement reached. United will pay around 20m    for the Porto left back. Medical tonight in the UK #SkyTransfer #TransferUpdate @SkySportsNews @SkySportNewsHD @Sky_Marc Sky Sports reported earlier on Sunday that a bid in the region of  £15m had been rejected by the Portuguese club.  However, it seems United have wasted no time in coming back with an improved bid, however. Within hours of those reports emerging, Sky's transfer reporter Max Bielefeld has claimed that the move is now a 'done deal'.  A fee in the region of    20m ( £18m) has been agreed for the 27-year-old, who has four goal involvements in three appearances this season and less than a year remaining on his current contract. The deal is expected to be announced ahead of Monday's deadline, after a medical is conducted in  Manchester on Sunday evening.
