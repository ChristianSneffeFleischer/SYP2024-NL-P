Brighton midfielder Moises Caicedo appeared to urge the club to sell him in a social media post on Friday night, only hours after Arsenal had a  Â£60m bid rejected. Chelsea have also been heavily linked. The Seagulls, who are sixth in the Premier League, have no interest in selling Caicedo this month and 90min has reported they are not looking to entertain further bids. Brighton boss Roberto De Zerbi seemed to suggest on at his Friday press conference that Caicedo   s preference would be to leave but that he and the club are trying to persuade him otherwise.    I spoke with him on Wednesday and I told him my opinion. It is always difficult to change during the season. For our way, it is important for him to stay a few more months,    De Zerbi explained.    He is relaxed. I spoke with him like a father, not a coach. I understand when one player has the possibility to change to a very big team. But my work is to give the style of play but also advice for his career and his life.    Speaking about his own future recently, Caicedo had said that his focus is on Brighton.    I am here, I   m playing every day. Things from outside don   t trouble me, nor does it take that focus away because I   m focussed only on here,    he commented. Yet taking to social media now, Caicedo made clear a desire to leave Brighton and speaking of his pride at being able to bring in a huge fee in what came across as an attempt to force the club's hand.    I am grateful to Mr. Bloom and Brighton for giving me the chance to come to the Premier League and I feel I have always done my best for them. I always play football with a smile and with heart. I am the youngest of 10 siblings from a poor upbringing in Santa Domingo in Ecuador,    he posted.    My dream always to be the most decorated player in the history of Ecuador. I am proud to be able to bring in a record transfer fee for Brighton which would allow them to reinvest it and help the club continue to be successful.
