Aston Villa are interested in a summer move for Roma striker Tammy Abraham, sources have told 90min. The 25-year-old has been operating in Serie A for the best part of 18 months after Roma, now managed by Jose Mourinho, paid Chelsea in excess of  £30m to sign him to a five-year contract. Abraham's first season at Roma was an overwhelming success as he scored 27 goals in all competitions - 17 of them in Serie A - en route to winning the Europa Conference League, but things haven't been so straightforward during 2022/23 with Abraham notching just seven goals in 30 appearances. Sources have now told 90min that Roma are ready to discuss selling Abraham this summer, though they will look to command a fee in excess of  £40m for the 11-cap England international. That potential price tag has not deterred the interest of Villa, 90min understands, who Abraham enjoyed a hugely successful loan spell with during the 2018/19 season. On this edition of Talking Transfers, part of the 90min podcast network,  Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  &  Toby Cudworth  discuss the Premier League's managerial merry-go-round with the latest on the situations at Leeds United and Southampton.

Indeed, Abraham scored 25 Championship goals in 37 appearances to help fire the club back into the Premier League, before breaking into the starting lineup at then parent club Chelsea. The Blues opted to sell Abraham to Roma following the appointment of Thomas Tuchel, and have shown little interest in activating the buyback clause written into the deal despite being on the hunt for a new number nine.
