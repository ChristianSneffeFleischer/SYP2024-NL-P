Cristiano Ronaldo has taken to social media to hit out at 'lies' surrounding his future at Manchester United. Ronaldo has asked to leave Old Trafford this summer and 90min understands he reiterated that desire upon his return to the club earlier this week - having been granted permission to miss United's pre-season tour for 'personal reasons'. In response to an Instagram post claiming that Sir Alex Ferguson took part in the latest meeting and has blocked Ronaldo's exit - sources have confirmed to 90min that the legendary former boss was not present - the 37-year-old hit back at the 'lies' surrounding his future. "Impossible not to talk about me for one day," he wrote. "Otherwise the press makes no money. "You know that if you don't lie you can't get people's attention. Keep going like that and one day you'll get some news right." Ronaldo also took the comments section of another post about the ongoing protest from Atletico Madrid fans against his potential transfer. A section of supporters recently held up a banner which read 'CR7 NOT WELCOME', and Ronaldo clearly enjoyed the post as he responded with four laughing emojis.

Patience."
