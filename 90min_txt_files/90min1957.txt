Southampton have confirmed the signing of Croatian World Cup star Mislav Orsic from Dinamo Zagreb on a two-and-a-half-year deal.  The 30-year-old was an integral part of the Croatia side which finished third in the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, scoring in the third-place play-off win over Morocco.  Speaking about the signing in a press release, new Saints manager Nathan Jones expressed his joy at making the signing early in the month:     Mislav is a significant addition to our squad and I   m delighted we have been able to get him in so quickly this month.    He   s a serious attacking threat and I   m sure anyone who has followed his progress or saw what he achieved at the World Cup will realise the talent he has. We   re excited to have him here.
