West Ham are nearing an agreement with Chelsea for the permanent transfer of Armando Broja, 90min understands. The 20-year-old did not feature in Chelsea's friendly against Club America in Las Vegas on Saturday and has left the club's pre-season tour of the United States prematurely to resolve his future. West Ham have been leading the chase for Broja - who has also been on the radar of Everton, Newcastle and Southampton - for much of the summer and 90min understands that the Hammers are closer than ever to agreeing a deal with Chelsea. A  Â£25m deal, with potential add-ons and buy-back clause, is close to being agreed, with Broja keen to move to London Stadium permanently rather than on loan. The idea of Broja spending a second season away from Chelsea on loan was floated - he spent last season on the books at Southampton - but West Ham's preference has always been to secure the Albanian on a permanent basis. With a deal nearing, 90min understands that West Ham may now walk away from Italy striker Gianluca Scamacca, having agreed in principle a    40m transfer from Sassuolo last week.
