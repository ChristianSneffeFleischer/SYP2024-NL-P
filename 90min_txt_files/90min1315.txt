Paris Saint-Germain have accepted that Lionel Messi is unlikely to extend his contract in the French capital, 90min understands, with further talks planned between Barcelona and the Argentine's father. Messi's contract with PSG expires in the summer and talks have been ongoing throughout the year over a new deal. However, sources have told 90min that PSG have now accepted that it is unlikely that 35-year-old Messi, who won the World Cup with Argentina at the back end of last year, will stay at Parc des Princes beyond this season. That further opens the door to a return to Barcelona, after 90min recently revealed that a reunion was becoming a more likely outcome. Barcelona have been very open with their interest in bringing Messi back to Catalonia - Barca vice-president Rafa Yuste admitted last week that the club are 'in contact' with the forward and his entourage.
