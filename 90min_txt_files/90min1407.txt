The agent of Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah has laughed off the latest reports that the winger is looking to leave Anfield this summer. With Liverpool set for a transitional summer, there have been plenty of rumours suggesting Salah could be offloaded. Paris Saint-Germain and Barcelona have both been touted as potential suitors. The latest report, from French outlet Foot Mercato, claimed Salah is 'increasingly considering' a move away from Liverpool during the summer, with a move to an unnamed Spanish club said to be his preferred move. The story was posted to Twitter and found its way to Salah's agent, Ramy Abbas Issa, who had no interest in humouring the speculation.
