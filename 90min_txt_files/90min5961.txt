Manchester United are said to be 'willing' to pay Barcelona youngster Ansu Fati's    170m ( £153m) release clause - and are looking to do so before he pens a new deal with the Catalan giants. The 17-year-old enjoyed an excellent breakout season with Bar  a in 2019/20, bagging eight goals in 33 appearances in all competitions. During the season, he made his first appearances for Spain Under-21s and has now been called up to the senior squad as well for his country's upcoming Nations League games. Fati penned a new deal with Barcelona back in December of 2019, but the club are already looking to tie him down to a new and improved contract. Now, Mundo Deportivo report that Bar  a are close to agreeing new contracts for Marc-Andr   ter Stegen, Nelson Semedo and Fati. In regards to the winger specifically, all the details of the contract have been 'discussed and agreed'. In fact, MD's report claims that all the player has to do is sign it. This will see his wages rise, while the release clause in Fati's contract would be set at a whopping    400m. But Man Utd remain interested in Fati and are said to be 'willing' to pay his  £153m release clause before he puts pen to paper on the new deal.  Not the news Manchester United fans will want to hear... MD allude to the fact that Borussia Dortmund's Jadon Sancho is the Premier League club's number one target, but Dortmund have stood firm in the negotiations thus far. As a result, United are said to have turned their attention to Fati as they look to bring in attacking reinforcements this summer.  Reports emerged in June that the Red Devils had made two bids for Fati, with the second worth around    150m in total. However, Bar  a were said to have 'no record' of such an offer, while the player himself had no intention of leaving anyway.
