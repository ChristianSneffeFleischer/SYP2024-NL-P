Exclusive - Gianluigi Donnarumma wants to succeed Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea as the highest paid goalkeeper in the world, but is happy to negotiate reduced terms to remain at Milan - even though talks over a new contract have reached an impasse. Donnarumma turns 22 this month but has already clocked up nearly 250 appearances for Milan, having broken regularly into the side as a fresh-faced 16-year-old back in 2015. His current contract at San Siro expires at the end of this season, and although he has previously expressed a desire to stay at the club, the uncertainty of the situation could potentially allow him to be poached as a free agent by any number of interested clubs. Donnarumma would like to be recognised with a world leading salary, more than what De Gea earns at Old Trafford. However, 90min can reveal he would accept a figure less than that in the region of    10.4m ( £9m). The problem is that Milan aren   t willing to offer more than    8.7m ( £7.5m). Another issue in talks is the length of any deal. Milan are understandably keen to lock in his future for the long-term and are insisting on a contract of at least five years until 2026 or beyond. But agent Mino Raiola is seeking a maximum three years, which has led to an impasse in negotiations with technical director Paolo Maldini. While a long-term deal helps protect Milan, a shorter deal leaves the power with Donnarumma and his agent to renegotiate again or threaten a high profile transfer in a couple of years. Paris Saint-Germain have long been interested in Donnarumma and sources close to the French champions believe they would be prepared to grant his wish as the highest paid goalkeeper in the world, if he was prepared to make the switch to Parc des Princes.
