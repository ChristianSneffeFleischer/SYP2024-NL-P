Michy Batshuayi is set to return to Crystal Palace on loan but not before he signs a contract extension at Chelsea.  The Belgian has struggled to break into the Blues first team since joining the club back in 2016, making just 16 Premier League appearances last season and scoring just once.  He previously spent the second half of the 2018/2019 campaign on loan at Selhurst Park and impressed during his temporary stay, striking six times in only 13 games. This was good enough to see him finish as the Eagles' fourth top scorer. Roy Hodgson is keen for the 26-year-old to return and Chelsea are open to the move. However, according to the Guardian, the Blues want to tie Batshuayi down on a longer deal before he departs. The striker's current contract expires next summer and they are wary of losing him on a free transfer in a year's time.  Palace's signing of Batshuayi should signal the end of their interest in his Chelsea teammate Conor Gallagher. The 20-year-old midfield had been linked with a move to south London but the Eagles cannot take two players on loan from one Premier League side.  It is likely that they will opt to sign Batshuayi due to their dearth of scoring options. No player got into double figures for Palace last season and Hodgson is eager to avoid a repeat of that this time out.
