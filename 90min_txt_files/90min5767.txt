Leeds United are hoping to convince Paris Saint-German star Julian Draxler to join the newly promoted Premier League side, but the German international is keen to remain in the French capital.  PSG sporting director Leonardo has been looking to move on the 26-year-old since January, and his prayers may have been answered by the Whites, who are keen on the prospect of landing the midfielder.  But according to French outlet RMC Sport, this deal remains a long way off completion, given Draxler's reluctance to leave les Parisiens, and his refusal to entertain the idea of joining Leeds - for the time being.  The ex-Schalke man has only one year remaining on his current contract with the Ligue 1 champions, and he has no intention of walking away from Paris before his deal expires next summer.  This will prove to be a huge stumbling block for both PSG and Leeds, with the French giants desperate to reduce their hefty wage bill, and Bielsa's side hoping to bolster their options ahead of their return to the English top flight.  Leonardo will also be keen to cash in on Draxler in the summer window, or he risks losing the player for nothing, as he will be able to negotiate a free transfer with whichever club he desires from January.
