Atalanta defender Timothy Castagne has revealed he would find it difficult to turn down a move to Tottenham as he hints at a departure from the Italian club. The Belgian international has been part of the side that has impressed both domestically and in the Champions League this season, with the club already through to the quarter-final stage after mauling Valencia in the round of 16. The 24-year-old arrived in Italy in 2017, after previously having played four seasons in his native Belgium with Genk. Now however, after three years with the club, Castagne is eager for a move away and named both Tottenham and PSG as two clubs he'd struggled to turn down (quotes via La Derniere Heure):    I think the time has come to move on, but I won   t be disappointed if I stay in Bergamo, I   m very proud of this. It   s proof that hard work pays off. I hope it   s more than just simple interest from them. "You have to be honest with yourself. When a teams like PSG or Tottenham come knocking on your door, you can   t say    no   ," he added.  The full-back was reportedly an Arsenal fan in his youth, yet explained this would not impact a potential move to Spurs: "I was especially a fan when Thierry Henry played for them. Now I   m not so much." The defender is perhaps keen to engineer a move having lost his place in the starting XI at the turn of the year. He does have international pedigree however, and has seven caps for Belgium thus far since his international debut in 2018.
