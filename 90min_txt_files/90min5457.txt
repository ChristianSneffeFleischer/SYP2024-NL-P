"I felt like the time was right to leave the [Man City] and push on. It was the right time in my career to move on and hopefully get a lot of Premier League games." Owner Tony Khan added: "I   m very excited to announce the addition of Tosin Adarabioyo to Fulham Football Club on a permanent transfer from Manchester City! Tosin has developed as a player and grown into a formidable defender out on loan to the Championship the past two seasons, where we saw his contributions at Blackburn Rovers first hand last season during our promotion campaign. We wish @TosinAdarabioyo the very best of luck on his permanent move to @FulhamFC ?? #ManCity | https://t.co/axa0klD5re pic.twitter.com/x3xWMPc1UU
