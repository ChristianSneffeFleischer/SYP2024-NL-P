Frank Lampard has claimed he tried to sign Erling Haaland while in charge at Chelsea in 2019. Lampard was appointed by the club where he established himself as an all-time midfield great that same year after leaving Derby County and remained in the hot seat until his sacking in 2021. A bright start while dealing with a transfer ban soured in his second season and he was dismissed after a poor run of results that had seen them fall away from the top of the tree. Lampard has since taken charge at Everton and steered them clear of relegation last season, but takes them to the Etihad Stadium this weekend to play Haaland and Manchester City. Speaking ahead of the game, he explained: "[Haaland] is an amazing player and the ultimate top level players generally can do what he does in a top level league. "I coached against him in a pre-season game when he was playing for Salzburg. I tried to sign him for Chelsea and it was not to be."
