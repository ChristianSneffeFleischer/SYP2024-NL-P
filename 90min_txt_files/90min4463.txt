The Premier League is still investigating Manchester City over financial fair play breaches, more than two years after the process began. In February 2020 the Citizens were banned from the Champions League by UEFA for two years and fined    30m for 'serious breaches' of FFP, though the suspension was later overturned by the Court of Arbitration for Sport and the financial sanction reduced to    10m for not cooperating fully with the governing body's investigation. The Daily Mail report that while UEFA's investigation has concluded, the Premier League are still coming to their own conclusions. The club previously had FFP trouble in 2014, when they were fined    60m - later reduced to    20m - and were dealt squad and transfer restrictions after they were found guilty. They did not appeal that verdict. UEFA's 2020 sanctions looked to have dealt City a major blow as they looked to continue their ascension throughout European football. The futures of key players like Kevin De Bruyne and manager Pep Guardiola were suddenly thrown into doubt. However, things again look much brighter on the pitch, with the squad tipped to dominate England's top flight for years to come.
