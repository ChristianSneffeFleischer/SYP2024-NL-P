Manchester United have been handed a boost in their pursuit of Real Madrid defender Sergio Reguilon, as potential suitors Sevilla have opted to sign Marcos Acu  a from Sporting instead  - clearing the path for the Red Devils to try and land their target. The 23-year-old excelled during his year-long loan spell with Sevilla, and many expected los Nervionenses to attempt to lure the left-back away from the Spanish capital on a permanent basis this summer. That transfer seems unlikely, however, as A Bola reports that Sevilla are now in 'advanced talks' to sign Sporting full-back Marcos Acu  a, who will join the Liga side as Reguilon's replacement on that left flank.  This will come as good news to Man Utd supporters, given that the Premier League giants have been linked strongly with a move for the Span international this summer. With Sevilla stepping aside, this could allow the Red Devils to really push and negotiate a deal with Madrid for the defender, who appears to be free to leave Santiago Bernabeu.  To add fuel to the fire, Fabrizio Romano believes the player 'would love to join' Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side, and his arrival would fix one of the key areas on the field for the Norwegian boss. The left-back spot has caused some concerns for Man Utd fans of late, with Brandon Williams and Luke Shaw both jostling to make that position their own.
