Contract extensions for defender William Saliba and winger Reiss Nelson are set to be confirmed by Arsenal this week, 90min understands. The Gunners agreed a new four-year deal with French defender Saliba earlier in June. His previous contract was due to expire at the end of next season and elite sides throughout Europe had registered their interest. Saliba formed an excellent partnership with Gabriel Magalhaes in defence in his first proper campaign with Arsenal and was never pushing for a move away from the Emirates this summer. Recent contracts have recently been confirmed for Gabriel Martinelli, Bukayo Saka and Aaron Ramsdale and a new deal for Nelson is also close to being finalised. The 23-year-old had previously spent time on loan with Hoffenheim and Feyenoord and only played in six Arsenal games before the World Cup. feed He returned two goals and three assists in 11 substitute appearances in the Premier League last season in total, including a star turn from the bench in a 3-2 win over Bournemouth in March. Extensions for both players will soon be confirmed officially, sources have told 90min. There's been plenty of change already at Arsenal during the summer transfer window. Granit Xhaka will soon depart to return to the Bundesliga with Bayer Leverkusen and is set to be replaced by West Ham and England ace Declan Rice. Jurrien Timber will soon ditch Ajax for the Gunners in a move worth  Â£40m, while Kai Havertz have already sealed a switch from Stamford Bridge to the Emirates.
