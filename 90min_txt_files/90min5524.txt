Barcelona are understood to have asked that Manchester United cover 100% of Ousmane Dembele   s wages should the French winger move to Old Trafford on loan ahead of Monday   s transfer deadline. United have remained in talks with Borussia Dortmund over primary target Jadon Sancho as the deadline nears, with the player himself reiterating to Dortmund earlier this week that he would be keen to make the switch to Old Trafford should an offer be accepted. Everything has already been agreed for the transfer to go ahead other than the fee with Dortmund, which still means it could yet happen very quickly if that breakthrough is made. The issue remains that both sides seem intent on    winning    the negotiations. While United still remain confident they can secure a deal for Sancho, they are not ignoring the possibility that it might not and a list of potential alternatives has been well publicised. Dembele is perhaps the highest profile name on that list. 90min understands that recent suggestions of a permanent transfer for the World Cup winner are wide of the mark as it stands. A loan is a more acceptable possibility for United, but now The Sun claims that Barcelona, who are seeking to raise money from sales, will only sanction a loan for Dembele if United pay his full salary. That figure is thought to be around  Â£215,000 per week. Ivan Perisic, Douglas Costa and Kingsley Coman are other names that been mentioned as potential Sancho alternatives. 90min also understands that a loan for Watford winger Ismaila Sarr is a possibility and could be secured quite quickly on deadline day if the Sancho falls through.
