Paris Saint-Germain president Nasser Al-Khelaifi has revealed that the club intend to keep hold of superstars Kylian Mbappe and Lionel Messi amid transfer rumours. Mbappe and Messi have been continuously linked with moves away from PSG in 2023 - links which have only become more and more frequent since the club's acrimonious exit from the UEFA Champions League at the hands of Bayern Munich. Argentine legend Messi has been of interest to Barcelona, with 90min reporting at the end of February that club president Joan Laporta is growing increasingly confident of persuading the forward to re-join the club, while Mbappe has been linked with a move to Real Madrid once again.  Speaking to Marca during the international break however, PSG president Al-Khelaifi has insisted that the club intend to keep hold of their prized assets this summer: "We are lucky to have some of the best players in the world, who wanted to play for PSG despite receiving offers from other clubs. "We are working to keep them going. We are going to analyse what we are doing and make sure we can continue with them; we want to do things accordingly. We are not going to make mistakes."

"Kylian has expressed it himself, but if you had asked any player you would have found him in the same state - very disappointed after the elimination. "Concerning Kylian, Kylian is a  PSG  player and he shows it in every game. He has a great determination to succeed and to perform well in order to help bring the club up to as high a level as possible."
