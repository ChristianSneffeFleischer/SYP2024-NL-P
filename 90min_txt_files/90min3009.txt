Inter CEO Beppe Marotta has explained the club's reasons for failing in their pursuits of Paulo Dybala and Bremer. The Nerazzurri were heavy favourites to sign both players earlier this summer, only for Dybala to head to Roma on a free transfer and Bremer to swap Torino for Juventus in a  Â£35m deal. On Dybala, 90min understands that Inter had to withdraw from the race to sign the Argentine after failing to strike a deal to terminate the contract of Alexis Sanchez, whose presence in the squad meant there was no space for Dybala - both physically and financially. "I said it before, we were and we are in a good place in the offensive sector," Marotta told DAZN of the failed Dybala move. "There was no space, not because he is not a valuable player but because the need was not there." Financial issues were also behind Inter's failure to wrap up a deal for Bremer. The Nerazzurri had hoped to sell Milan Skriniar to PSG to free up the funds but, having failed to do so thus far, could not raise the money needed to match Juve's bid. Marotta said of the situation: "He is a great player, but obviously our conditions relating to our financial balance did not allow us to reach a conclusion. "When offers arrive that are very far from ours, it is right that the seller and the player make their choice." "An opportunity has vanished," he added.
