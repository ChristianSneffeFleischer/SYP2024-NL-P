Arsenal's versatile midfielder Ainsley Maitland-Niles has garnered the interest of fellow Premier League side Newcastle United, who are keen on agreeing a loan deal.  Maitland-Niles joined Arsenal as a six-year-old, breaking into the senior side under Ars  ne Wenger in 2017. This season, Maitland-Niles - naturally a right-winger - has been used in a variety of positions and started the club's FA Cup final victory over Chelsea as a left wing-back.

Although, manager Mikel Arteta is thought to oppose this decision.  Alongside the surprise interest from north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur, the Daily Mail report that Newcastle are keen on taking Arsenal's 22-year-old academy graduate to the north east. The Gunners value Maitland-Niles at  Â£20m but Newcastle would prefer a loan deal for the England Under-21 international with an obligation to buy. Wolverhampton Wanderers are another interested party and consider Maitland-Niles a potential replacement for their right-winger Adama Traor  , if the highly sought-after speedster leaves Molineux this summer.  After securing the services of homegrown talent Matty Longstaff - following extensive contract negotiations - Newcastle are keen to bolster their midfield with FC Schalke 04's Weston McKennie.
