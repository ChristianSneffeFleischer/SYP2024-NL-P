Manchester United goalkeeper Sergio Romero has held talks with the club regarding his future after failing to secure a deadline day transfer. The Argentine has served as a fine back up for David De Gea ever since his 2015 transfer from Sampdoria, but Dean Henderson's return from his Sheffield United loan has thrust Romero down Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's pecking order. The 33-year-old was poised for a move to Goodison Park in the recently closed transfer window to provide competition - and potentially usurp - Jordan Pickford as Everton's number one, but the deal fell through when United demanded a fee and the Toffees instead signed Robin Olsen from Roma on a season-long loan. Nevertheless, Romero returned from Argentina in the week and is training alone at United's Carrington training complex after he wasn't named in their Premier League or Champions League squads.  Manchester Evening News understands Romero and his agent, Kristian Bereit, spoke with the club's hierarchy at the training ground in a bid to resolve his short-term future. With all the European windows now closed until January, the Argentine's only hope of securing an imminent move away is MLS, with the American window closing on Thursday. Romero has appeared 61 times for the Red Devils since his move five years ago, with the vast majority of his minutes arriving in cup competitions. In fact, he's only played seven  Premier League games - keeping six clean sheets.
