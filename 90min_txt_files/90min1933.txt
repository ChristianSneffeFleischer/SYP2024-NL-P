Manchester United are willing to send young striker Charlie McNeill out on loan in the January transfer window, 90min can confirm. The 19-year-old is one of the most promising academy graduates on United's books and he made his senior debut earlier this season in their Europa League defeat at home to Real Sociedad. But with a clear pathway to the first team currently blocked - the Red Devils are looking to bring in Netherlands striker Wout Weghorst on loan until the end of the season - United are open to loaning McNeill out until the end of the season. A number of Championship clubs are keen, including Millwall, Preston, Blackpool, while there's also interest from League One promotion hopefuls Barnsley and Ipswich - the latter of whom are managed by former United coach Kieran McKenna. Sources have confirmed to 90min that United are willing to sanction a loan move, with McNeill himself willing to test himself in professional football.
