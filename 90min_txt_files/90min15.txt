Paris Saint-Germain forward Neymar will complete his transfer to Al Hilal this week and has already picked out his new shirt number, sources have confirmed to 90min. The Brazil superstar will bring to an end his six-year stay in the French capital after agreeing terms on a two-year contract with the Saudi Pro League side. During his time with PSG, he averaged just 19 Ligue 1 matches per season and was continually criticised for his injury record and lifestyle away from the pitch. Neymar will wrap up a move to Saudi Arabia this week with Al Hilal set to pay    90m ( £77.6m) to PSG, and 90min understands the 31-year-old has been given the freedom to pick a new shirt number. Instead of taking on a new digit, Neymar will stick with his tried and tested number 10, which is currently free and will not need to be vacated. feed Neymar has worn the 10 shirt throughout his time at PSG and has played most of his games for Brazil with that number. He previously took the number 11 at Santos and Barcelona.  Sources have also told 90min that Al Hilal have not given up hope of signing Aleksandar Mitrovic. They reached an agreement with the Serbia international over personal terms earlier this summer, but despite indicating a willingness to pay    58m ( £50m), Fulham were unwilling to sanction a sale. PSG, meanwhile, are continuing their squad clear-out with the departures of Leandro Paredes and Renato Sanches to Roma. Argentine World Cup winner Paredes is set to return to the Stadio Olimpico after a previous spell with the Giallorossi on a permanent two-year deal, while Sanches is joining on an initial loan with an obligatory purchase clause if he plays in more than 60% of their Serie A matches this season.
