Wolves striker Raul Jimenez has confirmed that Manchester United and Juventus were keen on signing him during the summer, but remains adamant that he's happy at Molineux - for now. The 29-year-old was in outstanding form during the 2019/20 season, netting 27 goals in all competitions as Nuno Espirito Santo's side reached the latter stages of the Europa League, as well as sealing an impressive seventh-placed Premier League finish. The Mexican's goals almost inevitably saw him linked with a move away from Wolves, with United and Juventus both named as potential suitors as far back as May. A move failed to materialise though, and he penned a new three-and-a-half year contract in October to end any lingering speculation over his future. Now, speaking to  TUDN (via Goal), Jimenez has spoken of United and Juventus' interest, reaffirming he is more than happy to stay in the Black Country, before hinting that he'd be open to a move in the future. "One day I woke up and uventus wanted me, another Manchester United and what I know is that there were approaches made. But an agreement was never reached and nothing was close. I'm very happy  at  Wolves," Jimenez said. "The truth is I am very happy in Wolverhampton. It's never wrong to be in a place where you are well but they know that I am not satisfied [with my form], I always look for more. "It (a move) did not happen this time. If it happens at some point then it  will have to be what is  best for me, for Wolves and the team that I join.  But I am very happy at Wolves and being considered a very important player."
