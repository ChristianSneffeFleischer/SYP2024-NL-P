RB Leipzig have completed the signing of Barcelona prospect Ilaix Moriba on a permanent transfer. The midfielder joins the Bundesliga side after refusing to pen fresh terms at Camp Nou having entered the final year of his contract, with the deal worth  £14m plus  £5m in add-ons. Welcome to Leipzig, @IlaixMK! ?#HereWeGoMoriba #DeadlineDay pic.twitter.com/ml1cRgt1tC Ilaix has signed a five-year contract with Leipzig, keeping him in east Germany until 2026. The 18-year-old was linked with a cut-price move to a whole host of top European clubs having declined to extend his stay in Barcelona. Tottenham were among those interested in the Guinean, but he preferred a switch to the German top flight. Die Roten Bullen stole a march on their rivals and met Barcelona's    20m ( £17m) asking price with the transfer worth  £19m overall, while the Blaugrana have inserted a 10% sell-on clause. The Germans already had an agreement with the teenager over personal terms and a five-year contract ready to kick in in the summer of 2022 had they failed to force a transfer this summer, but they have got their man 12 months earlier.
