Bournemouth have pulled out of a  £21m deal to sign Villarreal striker Nicolas Jackson due to injury concerns, 90min understands. Jackson had made the trip to England this week to complete his proposed switch to the Vitality Stadium and, all things being as they should, confirmation was initially expected on Wednesday. However, there proved to be medical issues that the Cherries felt they could not ignore. Jackson hasn   t played for Villarreal so far this calendar year because of a hip injury. Bournemouth were obviously aware of that when agreeing a fee with the Spanish club, but 90min understands that, upon closer inspection, the extent of the problem was worse than they initially thought. As a result, the deal will not go ahead this month and Jackson is heading back to Spain. Fellow south coast club Southampton had earlier been in talks over a potential Jackson deal before Bournemouth took things to the next level by agreeing a fee. Bournemouth are still hoping to be busy in the final days of the January transfer window. Burkina Faso international Dango Ouattara has already arrived from Lorient this month, with a  £12m deal for Bristol City forward Antoine Semenyo also agreed but not completed. Ambitiously, the Cherries also made Roma aware of their willingness to pay    35m ( £30.7m) for winger Nicolo Zaniolo. Roma were happy to accept, but it wasn   t initially thought likely that the player himself would entertain the idea of joining a club not offering European football.
