The Saudi Pro League has now firmly put its money where its mouth in ongoing efforts to shift the global balance of club football away from Europe. Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema, even Lionel Messi - had he actually taken the offer, you can get your around and accept. These are the type of players whose best days are behind them and for whom an enormous pay day in Saudi Arabia is a nice, if morally questionable, retirement gift. N'Golo Kante, Roberto Firmino and Jordan Henderson were once top stars but won't be missed by the Premier League. At 26, Ruben Neves broke the trend of ageing players head to the Middle East, but the Portuguese midfielder is not exactly a global superstar. However, Kylian Mbappe is a different story altogether. News filtered through around Monday lunchtime in Europe that Al Hilal, one of the four clubs controlled by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, have made world record bid of  £259m (   300m) that is considered to be 'serious'. The idea is that Al Hilal could take Mbappe for just a single year. Al Hilal have submitted a record fee bid of    300,000,000 to PSG for Kylian Mbappe...Could you see it happening?      pic.twitter.com/bKadgcnxPQ Paris Saint-Germain are keen to sell, hoping to avoid losing their once in a generation star asset on a free transfer, and multiple clubs have been approached. For Mbappe, Real Madrid remains his only target and he will be eligible to sign a pre-contract with Los Blancos in January. Even for the money on offer - potentially the equivalent of  £1.5m per day - there are no guarantees that a 24-year-old Mbappe coming into his peak sells out on his dream and follows the cash. The money on the table is asbolutely unfathomable. You're Kylian Mbapp  .    700m offer on the table over a one-year deal. You then join Real Madrid next summer.Would you accept Al-Hilal's crazy contract offer?      pic.twitter.com/ufBfwHWlUL      Yearly:    700,000,000     Monthly:    58,300,000     Weekly:    13,300,000     Daily:    1,900,000     Hourly:    80,000     Minute:    1,332     Second:    22Alex Crook breaks down Al Hilal's world-record bid for PSG's Kylian Mbappe!   ¥  pic.twitter.com/hMwtShIT0v Are the numbers on the pitch worth it?
