Paris Saint-Germain are closing in on the signing of RB Leipzig defender Nordi Mukiele after terms were fully agreed with both club and player, 90min understands. The Ligue 1 champions had been overwhelming favourites to sign Mukiele in a deal worth    16m, but late interest from Chelsea had threatened to derail the deal. The Blues have been long-term admirers of Mukiele, alongside Premier League rivals Manchester United, and have grown frustrated in their pursuit of Sevilla defender Jules Kounde over the past week or so - although they still hope to complete a transfer ahead of Barcelona. But any hopes of landing Mukiele have now been extinguished after sources confirmed to 90min that a deal with PSG is fully agreed. The Frenchman has agreed personal terms, with the 24-year-old expected to pen a long-term contract in the French capital, and he will now undergo a medical before the move is confirmed. Listen now to 90min's Talking Transfers podcast, with  Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  &  Toby Cudworth. On the latest show they discuss Chelsea finally closing in on Jules Kounde, Man Utd's ongoing pursuit of Frenkie de Jong, West Ham's hunt for a new forward and left-back and more.
