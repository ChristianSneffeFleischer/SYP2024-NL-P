Arsenal have reached an agreement for the transfer of Ajax defender Jurrien Timber, 90min understands. The Gunners have already confirmed the signing of Kai Havertz from Chelsea this week in a deal worth in excess of  £65m, while they have agreed a British record transfer with West Ham for England international Declan Rice that will total  £105m. A deal in place for Timber will now take their spending to over  £200m. Arsenal   s opening    35m offer for Timber fell well short of Ajax   s    60m asking price. But the Gunners remained confident and the Dutch giants went on to compromise. feed 90min understands that a fee has been agreed that will see Arsenal pay an initial    42m, topped up by    5m in add-ons. The overall package is worth    47m ( £40.5m). Personal terms have already been agreed with Timber   s camp and it could now pave the way for completion before the weekend. It appears the primary hope for right-sided Timber at Arsenal is that he will mirror Oleksandr Zinchenko   s inverted full-back position on the opposite side of the defence.
