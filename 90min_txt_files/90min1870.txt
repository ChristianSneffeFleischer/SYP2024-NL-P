One of January   s most high-profile transfer sagas has come to an end with Chelsea signing Mykhaylo Mudryk from Shakhtar Donetsk in a  Â£100m deal.  The Ukrainian has penned an eight-and-a-half-contract at Stamford Bridge, even though he looked all-but certain to sign for Premier League rivals Arsenal early in the window. Arsenal had identified Mudryk as their top January target early. In fact, they were already negotiating with Shakhtar Donestsk in December to try and get a deal over the line quickly.  It was a deal that clearly appealed to Mudryk too, so much so that he openly admitted that he would struggle to turn down Arsenal.  "Arsenal are a very good team," he explained. "A very good coach. I like the way they play. From my side, I can't say no." It appears that he has said    no    to Arsenal, although there is a lot more to it than that.  The answer to that question probably depends on your point of view, but it is either that Chelsea wanted him more or Arsenal didn   t want him enough.  Ultimately, while Arsenal were able to agree terms with Mudryk early, they never actually reached an agreement with Shakhtar.  The Gunners were willing to pay a significant sum for Mudryk, but the structure of the deal was not to the Ukrainian club   s liking. They wanted more up-front and less achievement-based add-ons, while Arsenal wanted less up front and more add-ons. Arsenal were sticking to their guns in terms of their transfer policy, which is a lot stricter than that of Chelsea   s right now. It   s commendable, but it also opened the door for their London rivals to step in.
