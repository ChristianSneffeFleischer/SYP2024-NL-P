Ex-Liverpool forward Roberto Firmino is on the cusp of joining his next club after becoming the latest player to agree a deal to move to Saudi Arabia, 90min understands. Firmino departed Liverpool after eight years and six major trophies at the end of the 2022/23 season, with his contract due to expire this month. The Brazilian, who scored 111 goals in 362 appearances and has been hailed for his impact by both Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane in recent days, explained his decision to move on was motivated by the    cycle    coming to an end and it feeling the right time to do so. Jurgen Klopp had wanted Firmino to stay at Anfield, declaring in January: "I want to keep him". The Liverpool boss later admitted his 'surprise' when the forward communicated he was ready to leave. 90min understands that Firmino will now be one of the next big names to take his career to the Saudi Pro League, following in the footsteps of Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema and N   Golo Kante. feed The 31-year-old has agreed terms on a three-year contract that will take him to within a few months of his 35th birthday in 2026. He is set to join Al-Ahli, one of the league's four leading clubs controlled by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), who also own a controlling stake in Newcastle.
