Mauro Icardi has said that he will not be leaving Paris Saint-Germain this summer, despite reports linking him with a return to Italy.  Icardi joined PSG in 2019, initially on loan before sealing a permanent transfer at the beginning of last season. After making an impressive start, scoring 12 goals in his first 20 Ligue 1 games and also performing well in Europe, he was hampered by injury during the 2020/21 campaign.  This summer reports have linked him with a move away from Paris with both Juventus - who were said to be eyeing up a fanciful swap deal involving Cristiano Ronaldo - and Roma interested. However, Icardi has now shot down these rumours.  After a fan on Instagram asked whether he would be departing PSG, he replied: "This season, the next and the next!!! That has never been in doubt!!! Come on PSG," via Football Italia.  Icardi's desire to remain at the club may be linked to the uncertain future of Kylian Mbappe. Mbappe has long been a target for Real Madrid and after several seasons of waiting Los Blancos are set to kick off negotiations over the coming weeks.
