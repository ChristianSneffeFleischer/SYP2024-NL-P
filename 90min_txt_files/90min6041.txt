Serie A runners-up Inter are reportedly planning a sizeable squad overhaul in the current transfer window, with four Premier League players among a long list of names linked to the Nerazzurri.  Antonio Conte's side finished one point behind title winners Juventus but led the league as late as December before a run of draws at the turn of the year. Inter spent almost  £150m in the summer of 2019, eclipsing the club's long-standing record signing of Christian Vieri with the  £66m arrival of Romelu Lukaku.  Despite this spend, Conte repeatedly pointed to a lack of experience in the squad, which prompted the club to fork out around  £24m for Tottenham Hotspur's Christian Eriksen in January. The former Chelsea manager was even tipped to leave Inter following another outburst at the end of the Serie A season. However, the Nerazzurri appear to be willing to show their commitment to Conte with a huge transfer window according to the Italian publication La Gazzetta dello Sport. Inter have already completed deals for Real Madrid defender Achraf Hakimi and brought Alexis S  nchez to San Siro permanently in this window. These two arrivals epitomise the blend of youthful exuberance and 'winning spirit' Inter are targeting in the market. Antonio Conte's love for wing-backs continues.Achraf Hakimi is set to join Inter in a    45m deal, according to reports. |        @jamescormack_ A reunion between Conte and N'Golo Kant   is thought be near the top of the Italian's wishlist while left-back Emerson Palmieri is another Chelsea player Inter are interested in.
