Manchester United have made an enquiry over the availability of Bayern Munich forward Leroy Sane, who used to play for rivals Man City, as Erik ten Hag looks to build up his attacking options.

Bayern have since insisted that Sane will be staying. Wolves are close to landing Portugal star Goncalo Guedes from Valencia, having submitted a  Â£27m offer.
