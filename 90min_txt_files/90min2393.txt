Paris Saint-Germain will have the option to buy young midfielder Xavi Simons back from PSV Eindhoven next summer. The young Dutchman left PSG this summer on a free transfer and has excelled in the Eredivisie, racking up six goals and four assists in just nine games and flashing the kind of potential that was widely expected of him during his time with both PSG and boyhood side Barcelona. His departure had many PSG fans scratching their heads, not least because the Ligue 1 side received  no money in exchange for one of the game's most popular young talents, but Rik Elfrink has now unearthed the terms of the agreement. In the summer of 2023, PSG will have the option to re-sign Simons for between    10m and    12m, but that fee will rise with each passing year. The buy-back clause is also not permanent and will expire on a certain date which, as of yet, has not been made public. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  and  Toby Cudworth  bring you a brand new episode of Talking Transfers. The team discuss Chelsea's interest in Declan Rice, Christopher Nkunku and Josko Gvardiol, while there are also updates on Cristiano Ronaldo, Donny van de Beek and more.
