Chelsea co-owner Todd Boehly has arrived in Spain for talks with Barcelona over a handful of players, 90min can confirm. The two clubs have been linked since even before the transfer window opened. Andreas Christensen has already swapped Stamford Bridge for Camp Nou and Barcelona hope to follow that deal up with an agreement to sign defenders Cesar Azpilicueta and Marcos Alonso, both of whom have just 12 months remaining on their contracts. 90min understands that both players are keen to make the move and had been granted permission under the Blues' previous owners, although Boehly's stance on the pair is not yet clear. Barcelona remain determined to get a deal done, with club director Jordi Cruyff recently admitting the takeover had slowed their moves down, but Boehly is now in Barcelona for formal talks about possible transfers. Listen now to 90min's Talking Transfers podcast, with  Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey,  Harry Symeou  &  Toby Cudworth.
