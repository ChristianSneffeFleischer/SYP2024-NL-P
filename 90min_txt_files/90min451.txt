Daichi Kamada is suddenly on the market again after AC Milan pulled the plug on his proposed free transfer to San Siro, 90min understands. Various clubs in the Premier League, Serie A and Bundesliga have all been informed of the situation and his availability. Japan international Kamada has been a free agent since the end of June when his contract with Eintracht Frankfurt expired. The 26-year-old had made a name for himself with the German club since 2017, winning the Europa League in 2021/22 and then reaching the knockout rounds of the Champions League in 2022/23. As a goalscoring midfielder, he found the net 16 times in all competitions last season. Seeking a new challenge, an agreement to join Milan was reached in early June. However, just a few days later the club sacked technical director Paolo Maldini, while Frederic Massara also left his role as sporting director. Chief executive Giorgio Furlani and chief scout Geoffrey Moncada have been overseeing transfers since, with Antonio D   Ottavio, former head of youth scouting, said to also be internally promoted to fill the sporting director vacancy. feed That has changed the situation regarding Kamada and the new hierarchy have different ideas. 90min understands the deal was agreed and signed from the player   s side of things, with Milan pulling out. As a free agent without a club, he now has to look elsewhere. Inter and Napoli, both of whom finished higher than Milan in the final Serie A table last season, have been offered Kamada. Borussia Dortmund, who had shown an interest in the player before, have also been informed of the situation. It is a similar story for Tottenham and Newcastle, each holding an interest previously.
