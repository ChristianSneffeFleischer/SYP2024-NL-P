Chelsea winger Hakim Ziyech has taken to social media to make fun of his failed move to Al Nassr. The Morocco international was set to join the Saudi Pro League side on a lucrative contract and become a teammate of Cristiano Ronaldo. However, 90min reported last week that a deal hung in the balance as a medical unearthed that Ziyech had a knee problem. Al Nassr tried to renegotiate his contract as a result but could not come to an agreement, despite Chelsea's willingness to lower the transfer fee and get a deal over the line. Ziyech is now back on holiday ahead of his scheduled return to Cobham for pre-season training and has spent some time back on the pitch, putting his supposedly problematic knee to the test and laughing at Al Nassr's assessment on his Instagram story.

N'Golo Kante joined champions Al Ittihad upon the expiry of his contract at the end of June, linking up with reigning Ballon d'Or winner Karim Benzema. Kalidou Koulibaly was then signed by Al Hilal, ending his one-year stint at Chelsea, while goalkeeper Edouard Mendy was sold to Al Ahli. Meanwhile, Mateo Kovacic and Kai Havertz have made moves to other Premier League clubs, heading to Manchester City and Arsenal respectively. Mason Mount's deal to join Manchester United is expected to be announced shortly.
