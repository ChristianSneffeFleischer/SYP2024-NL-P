 Antoine Griezmann's former agent has claimed that Ronald Koemann's arrival at Barcelona will see the Frenchman become a key player in Catalonia. That's despite reports in Spain claiming that maligned president Josep Bartomeu recently attempted to trade him...wait for it...to Atletico Madrid, in exchange for Joao Felix.

"Before the disaster vs Bayern, Antoine wanted one thing: to leave," Olhats told RMC Sport, per Metro. "He felt like he was no longer part of the plan, that things couldn   t continue like that.
