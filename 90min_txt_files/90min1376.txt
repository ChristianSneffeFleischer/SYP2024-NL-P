Newcastle have held talks with the representatives of Borussia Monchengladbach striker Marcus Thuram as they prepare to rival Inter for his signature, 90min understands. The 25-year-old Frenchman has 12 goals and three assists from 24 Bundesliga outings this season and will be one of the more valuable free agents this summer as he approaches the final few months of his contract in Germany. Teams from across Europe are interested in Thuram, and sources have told 90min that Inter are confident they are leading the charge for the striker - though Newcastle remain in the mix. The Magpies are looking to sign a new forward who can also play out wide - Thuram was a left winger before his recent transition to a central role - and a recent round of talks has been held between the two parties. Thuram is seen as a potential replacement for Allan Saint-Maximin, who is increasingly likely to be sold by Newcastle this summer. READ NEXT manual Newcastle are also known to hold an interest in Thuram's younger brother, Nice midfielder Khephren, as part of their search for midfield reinforcements. As for Marcus, the eldest Thuram brother has plenty of suitors from across the Premier League. Chelsea, who discussed a January transfer for the France striker, are known to retain their interest. Aston Villa, Everton, Leicester and West Ham are all among Thuram's lengthy list of suitors, with the Gladbach striker expecting plenty of offers this summer ahead of a probable exit from the Bundesliga. Nevertheless, Inter remain intent on winning the race for Thuram's signature and bringing him over to Serie A to follow in the footsteps of his father Lilian, who made 307 appearances in Italy's top flight between 1996 and 2006.
