Manchester United left-back Brandon Williams is being tracked by a number of Premier League sides as his struggle for Premier League minutes continues. The 20-year-old broke into the first team last season and looked like United's left-back of the future, but a return to form for Luke Shaw and the  Â£18m arrival of Alex Telles from Porto has seen him make just two Carabao Cup appearances this season. Williams has only made the bench twice in the Premier League this year, which has prompted rumours that the Englishman could be heading out of the club in January. The latest update comes from The Athletic, who state Southampton are one of several sides keeping tabs on Williams' situation ahead of a potential loan bid in January. The Saints pursued Williams during the summer and he was willing to head out for the experience, but his exit was blocked by manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who made it clear Williams was still part of his plans. It hasn't worked out that way, with Williams well down the pecking order and spending some time with the Under-23s this season, and now Southampton have been tipped to reignite their pursuit. It's noted that United are reluctant to strengthen a 'rival', so it's suggested United could wait to see whether fifth-placed Southampton will be a genuine threat to their chances of European qualification before making a decision. Williams might not be the only player looking for a temporary new home. The Sun note Leeds and Brighton are both keen on landing goalkeeper Dean Henderson, who is stuck behind David de Gea in the pecking order. Sources have previously confirmed to 90min that Henderson is keen to head out on loan after being told by England manager Gareth Southgate he would likely have been the Three Lions' starting goalkeeper by now if he had been playing regularly this year.
