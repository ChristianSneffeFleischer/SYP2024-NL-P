Roma have rejected Tottenham's bid to take Nicolo Zaniolo on loan with an obligatory purchase clause, 90min understands. Spurs head coach Antonio Conte and managing director of football Fabio Paratici are both keen on bringing the Italy international to north London this summer and talks have been ongoing with the Giallorossi for some time. However, 90min understands that Roma are unhappy with Tottenham's most recent offer for the 23-year-old. Spurs' bid of a season-long loan with an obligation to buy for    25m plus a further    10m in add-ons was rejected by the Serie A side, who want at least    50m if they are to sanction a departure at all. Roma are open to letting Zaniolo leave on an initial loan with a purchase clause, while Spurs are wary of his unsettling fitness record - which includes consecutive ACL injuries in both of his knees - and want to see how he fares physically in the Premier League. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  &  Sean Walsh  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Chelsea's plans to sign Wesley Fofana. There's the latest on James Maddison, Jamie Vardy, Cristiano Ronaldo and Frenkie de Jong, and chat on Diogo Jota's new deal and Roberto Firmino's Liverpool future.
