Fulham are close to completing three new signings with Layvin Kurzawa, Justin Kluivert and Willian set to join, 90min understands. The Championship holders went into the Premier League season with six senior signings - including two loans - completed, but manager Marco Silva publicly bemoaned of their summer business and requested further reinforcements. They have since brought in centre-back Issa Diop from West Ham, and are set to continue their late-window spending with a trio of new signings. 90min reported recently that left-back Kurzawa had agreed personal terms with Fulham, and the west Londoners are now close to reaching an agreement with PSG to complete the deal. Roma winger Kluivert, son of Netherlands legend Patrick, is set to finalise a loan move from Roma in the coming days. He spent last season on loan at Nice, scoring six goals in 31 games. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  &  Toby Cudworth  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Lucas Paqueta's move to West Ham, Chelsea's plans to sign Anthony Gordon, Wesley Fofana and Arsen Zakharyan and the latest from Old Trafford.
