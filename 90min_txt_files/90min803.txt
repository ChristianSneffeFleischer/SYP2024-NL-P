Martin Odegaard says he is happy at Arsenal and hopes to remain at the club for years to come in response to rumoured transfer interest from Paris Saint-Germain. Odegaard enjoyed a stunning campaign by leading Arsenal to second place in the Premier League and secure a return to the Champions League. The Norwegian scored 15 league goals alongside seven assists and 90min revealed in May that Arsenal were planning to sit down with Odegaard to thrash out new terms.  The 24-year-old's contract current contract expires in 2025 and he admitted he is not personally involved in fresh talks right now. He told TV2: "I have a few years left on the contract, I'm fine and I hope to be at the club for a long time to come. "I have not spoken to them, that is not my task. To be honest, I don't know how the situation is right now. Well, it's not me who controls it. Now I'm focusing on the national team, so I may take it after the summer if they want to do something." feed Arsenal have locked down a number of their top talents to new deals in recent months, with Bukayo Saka, Aaron Ramsdale and William Saliba all signing new contracts of late. The north London side are still looking to make their first big splash in the summer transfer window and have moved for West Ham midfielder Declan Rice, though the Europa Conference League winners rejected a first offer which was worth  £80m with  £10m in add-ons. Kai Havertz is another target for Mikel Arteta, though his side will face competition from Bayern Munich for the Germany international.
