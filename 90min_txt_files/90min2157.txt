New RB Leipzig sporting director Max Eberl has confessed that 'something is looming' with Christopher Nkunku's future. Chelsea invited Nkunku for a medical during the summer and have spent the first half of this season in talks with Leipzig over a double deal for both the French forward and centre-back partner Josko Gvardiol. 90min revealed in November that an agreement for Nkunku had effectively been wrapped up and, after the 25-year-old was ruled out of the World Cup through injury, it was eventually accepted that Nkunku's move to Chelsea would come in the summer, rather than in January. The transfer is effectively complete but has yet to be confirmed by either side, although Eberl did suggest that an update on Nkunku's future can be expected soon. "With Christo, I can   t confirm anything yet," he told a press conference. "There is a lot of interest and a lot of talk with us. Accordingly, something is looming."
