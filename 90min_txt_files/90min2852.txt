Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel has revealed his desire to add another central defender to his squad this summer. The Blues recently announced the addition of Marc Cucurella from Brighton, with Kalidou Koulibaly having also arrived from Napoli earlier in the window. However, Tuchel admits that Chelsea may need to strengthen their defensive ranks further after missing out on a deal for now Barcelona defender Jules Kounde. Quizzed why the Blues ended their pursuit of Kounde, the German responded: "That Cesar Azpilicueta stayed, in actually the best position for Jules Kounde, these talks had an effect and it   s also the position of Trevoh Chalobah if we play in a back three.    Marc [Cucurella] can play in a back three on the left, Kalidou [Koulibaly] can play on the left of a three. Thiago Silva, who is not Benjamin Button and not getting younger, unfortunately, even though sometimes it seems like it.    Maybe we bring one more player, maybe not. Still, we have Malang Sarr with us and Ethan Ampadu still with us. We have options but at the same time, we know how many games are coming. So let   s see if we can sign a player."
