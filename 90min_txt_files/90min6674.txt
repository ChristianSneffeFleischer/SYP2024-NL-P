Inter are said to be in the lead in the race to sign Hellas Verona defender Marash Kumbulla - but Juventus are still showing an interest. Kumbulla has emerged as one of the most exciting young defenders to currently be playing in Serie A, with his fine performances for Verona attracting the attention of Italy's giants as well as other top clubs from around Europe.  Fabrizio Romano has taken to his Twitter account to report that it is actually Inter who are currently in 'pole position' to land the talented 20-year-old, adding that 'advanced talks' are still ongoing as they look to reach an agreement and conclude the deal.  While Juventus are also keen on securing his services and are 'ready' to move to make the deal happen, Romano notes that everything will depend on Inter's actions. Furthermore, while a number of Premier League clubs were said to be showing an interest in Kumbulla, there have been no 'serious bids' from any clubs in England's top division.  However, other reports from Italy suggest that it is Juventus who are in the lead for Kumbulla's signature - and have even reached an agreement with the centre-back. La Stampa (via Sempreinter) report that Kumbulla has agreed a five-year deal with the Bianconeri and, as a result, the Italian giants are ready to launch an offer of around    32m in order to conclude the deal.
