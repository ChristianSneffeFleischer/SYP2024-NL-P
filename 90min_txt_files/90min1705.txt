The name may suggest otherwise, but Student Syndrome does not only apply to school children that wait until the day before class to finish their homework. It definitely applies to transfer deadline day too. Clubs across the continent are guilty of only finalising their transfer business on the last available day of the window. Admittedly, this may not be deliberate procrastination, but the activity off the pitch does undoubtedly spike on January 31. Here's where you can get your fix of all the action that unfolds at the end of the January window. The final day of January - Tuesday, 31st - is, fittingly, the final day of the winter window across Europe. However, the continent's top tiers cannot agree on a closing time. Premier League and EFL clubs have settled for 23:00 (GMT) on 31 January. La Liga have also plumped for 23:00 (GMT) but Scottish sides have until 23:59 (GMT) to wrap any deadline day deals up. Ligue 1 have also pushed the deadline to the final minute of January 2023. The Bundesliga's transfer window slams shut at the reasonable hour of 17:00 (GMT) while Serie A's wheeling and dealing concludes at 19:00 (GMT). UK viewers can sit themselves down in front of Sky Sports Premier League from 07:00 (GMT) to binge on coverage of all the deals up to midnight and beyond. The US broadcaster Peacock Premium is also delivering Sky Sports' coverage of the closing stages to spectators across the Atlantic. The Premier League window closes at 18:00 (ET) - 15:00 (PT).
