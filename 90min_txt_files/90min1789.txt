The agent of Leandro Trossard has suggested that the new Arsenal forward would have signed for Tottenham this month if they didn't dither in negotiations. The Belgium international sealed a move away from Brighton earlier this week following a fall-out with head coach Roberto De Zerbi. After missing out on the signing of top target Mykhailo Mudryk to Chelsea, Arsenal swiftly switched gears and swooped in to take Trossard off the Seagulls' hands this week. However, he could have been heading to a different part of north London, with Trossard's agent, Josy Comhair, revealing talks were held with Spurs this month. However, they were not as easy to negotiate with as Arsenal. "Spurs were in contact with us for the last two weeks. But it was 'we want him, but wait this, wait that'. Wednesday we got in touch with Arsenal - 24 hours later they had an agreement," Comhair said. On this edition of Talking Transfers, Scott Saunders hosts Toby Cudworth & Graeme Bailey to discuss all the big transfer stories. This week's agenda includes Jude Bellingham, Harry Kane, Declan Rice, Hakim Ziyech, Leandro Trossard, Pedro Porro, Mykhaylo Mudryk and more!
