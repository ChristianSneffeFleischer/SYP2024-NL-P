Atletico Madrid centre-back Mario Hermoso has reportedly rejected a switch to Leicester City. The Foxes have been looking to bring in a new central defender, having not replaced last summer's club record sale Harry Maguire.  According to AS, Hermoso was on Leicester's radar, but the Spaniard turned down the move because he still hopes he can break into the starting XI at Atletico Madrid. The defender signed for Los Rojiblancos last summer from Espanyol for a reported    25m fee. The 25-year-old made just 15 league starts last season, with manager Diego Simeone favouring Stefan Savic, Felipe, and Jose Maria Gimenez. However, with Savic and Felipe both being significantly older than Hermoso, the former Real Madrid youth product could force his way into the starting lineup.  AS also stated that Hermoso rejected an offer from fellow La Liga club Real Sociedad. Nonetheless, it seems like Leicester's hunt for a centre-back is about to end after they reached an agreement with Saint-Etienne for French teenager Wesley Fofana, as confirmed by the Ligue 1 side on their official website. Fofana made his debut for Saint-Etienne in May 2019 in a 3-0 win over Nice.  The 19-year-old has made 20 Ligue 1 appearances, prompting the Foxes to agree a deal reportedly worth up to    40m.
