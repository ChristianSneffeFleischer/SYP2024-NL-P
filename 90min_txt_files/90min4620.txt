Paulo Dybala will be transfer listed this summer with Juventus open to the idea of a swap deal involving the out-of-favour forward. The Argentina international has flourished into one of Serie A's top talents since moving to the Old Lady from Palermo back in 2015. Speculation over his future has circulated for a number of years, with a whole host of European behemoths reportedly keen to lure him away from Turin. Premier League clubs Manchester United, Chelsea and Tottenham have all been heavily linked with a move for Dybala, and it now seems he could be set for a move away from the Serie A champions. Corriere dello Sport report that Dybala will be put on the transfer list by Juventus this summer as they actively seek a buyer for the 27-year-old, though they're also open to the idea of a swap deal. The report hinges on comments made by Juve vice president Pavel Nedved, and while the former midfielder concedes Andrea Pirlo's men have suffered in Dybala's absence this season - with the Argentinian having suffered a knee injury in January - he also adds the forward has just one year remaining on his deal and the club will be considering their options. "We missed Paulo, he would have guaranteed us offensive variants and goals," he said. "He has a contract for another year and I have nothing else to add to what Paratici and President Agnelli have already said. But it is clear that at Juventus we evaluate every market opportunity." The report goes on to claim that Juve have already listed a number of potential swap deals they could be interested in, with Barcelona's Antoine Griezmann and Paris Saint-Germain's Mauro Icardi both named. While the aforementioned injury has seen Dybala sidelined since the turn of the year, his place in Juventus' starting XI was far from secure even when he was fully fit.
