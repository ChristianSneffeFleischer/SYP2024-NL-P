Tottenham are edging closer to signing Wolfsburg defender Micky van de Ven, 90min understands. Spurs initiated contact with the German club over the 22-year-old as they search for a new central defender after a calamitous 2022/23 season at the back. Liverpool hold an interest in the young Dutchman but sources indicate there is now an expectation Van de Ven will sign for Ange Postecoglou's Tottenham in a  Â£30m deal. Personal terms are also almost finalised. Van de Ven recently played for the Netherlands in the 2023 UEFA European Under-21 Championship as his side came third in Group A and were eliminated. He played 33 times as Wolfsburg came eighth in the Bundesliga last season. Reinforcements are needed in central defence for Spurs. Eric Dier and Davinson Sanchez have struggled in recent years while Cristian Romero's form dropped off during the second half of the season. feed The north London side remain in discussions with Bayer Leverkusen for Edmond Tapsoba, though there is concern at growing rival interest from Premier League sides Liverpool, Manchester United and Newcastle. Barcelona president Joan Laporta has also claimed he thinks a permanent transfer for Clement Lenglet will be arranged this summer. Spurs decided against triggering their option to buy the Frenchman earlier this summer after a loan spell. Guglielmo Vicario and James Maddison have arrived at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium from Empoli and Leicester respectively, while Manor Solomon has agreed terms ahead of a free transfer from Shakhtar Donetsk.
