Nottingham Forest have opened talks with Real Betis regarding midfielder William Carvalho, 90min understands. A product of Sporting CP's academy, Carvalho has often been linked with a move to England over the years, with Manchester United often touted as a potential destination and Fulham reportedly interested in recent months. 90min understands that Premier League newcomers Forest are keen to build on their busy summer of transfer activity with a move for the 30-year-old, who is currently in England as part of Betis' pre-season preparations. They play Marseille in nearby Chesterfield on Wednesday before facing Brentford on Saturday. Carvalho, who has been capped 73 times by Portugal, is also the subject of interest from Serie A side Monza and Turkish giants Galatasaray. Lyon too are hoping to bring him in part exchange for former Arsenal target Houssem Aouar. Forest have also asked Betis about the availability of left-back Alex Moreno, though the 29-year-old is unsure about a move to the City Ground and Los Verdiblancos aren't keen on selling him regardless.
