Southampton have rejected a second bid from Liverpool for midfielder Romeo Lavia, 90min understands. Lavia has attracted plenty of interest from towards the top of the Premier League after Southampton's relegation, but it is Liverpool who are currently pushing hardest for his signature. A  £35m bid was knocked back last month and sources have confirmed to 90min that Liverpool have now seen an improved offer, worth  £42m including add-ons, rejected by Southampton. While Southampton would prefer to keep Lavia, they are prepared to cash in for the right price and have placed a firm price tag of  £50m on the 19-year-old, who only joined from Manchester City last summer for an initial  £10.5m. Talks will continue between the two sides and Liverpool are expected to return with an improved bid in the near future, with Jurgen Klopp keen to add a third new face to his midfield after the signings of Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai. feed Liverpool are hopeful a deal can be reached soon but are also looking at potential alternatives if Southampton refuse to drop their asking price. One of those on Liverpool's shortlist is 22-year-old Fluminense midfielder Andre Trindade, who nearly joined Fulham in January and remains on the radar of the Cottagers. Fulham have been in talks with Andre but believe the once-capped Brazil international has his sights set on a move to a team capable of offering regular European football. Alongside Liverpool, Andre's representatives have spoken with Barcelona, Atletico Madrid, Arsenal, Tottenham and West Ham. Liverpool have lost both Jordan Henderson and Fabinho to the Saudi Pro League this summer and now hope to find another new midfielder to balance out the squad, with Lavia understood to be Klopp's preferred target.
