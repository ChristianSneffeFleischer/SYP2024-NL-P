Borussia Dortmund left-back Raphael Guerreiro is wanted by several Premier League clubs with his contract set to expire in the summer, 90min understands. The Portugal international has established himself as one of Europe's most complete attacking full-backs since his switch to BVB in 2016 - he has scored 38 goals and provided 45 assists in 214 games for the Bundesliga side. But with Guerreiro's deal up at the end of the season, he looks set to move on from Signal-Iduna Park. Sources have told 90min that several clubs from Italy and Spain, in addition to some of Dortmund's rivals in Germany, have made their interest known to Guerreiro. There are also plenty of admirers in England willing to throw their names into the ring. Leeds United have been linked with a move for Guerreiro in recent months and they remain keen on a deal, while he is also wanted by Aston Villa, Newcastle United and Wolves. 90min recently reported that Villa, Leeds and Newcastle's search for left-backs have also led them to Arsenal's Kieran Tierney. Sources have also suggested that runaway Championship leaders Burnley could make an audacious attempt to recruit Guerreiro ahead of their return to the Premier League. Any such move would be complicated after the Clarets were placed under a transfer embargo, though they expect this to be lifted in April. LISTEN NOW
