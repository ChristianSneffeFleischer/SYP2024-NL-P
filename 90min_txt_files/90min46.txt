Paris Saint-Germain have confirmed the signing of French winger Ousmane Dembele from Barcelona. Dembele had been in talks over extending his Barcelona contract before PSG voiced a desire to trigger the    50m release clause in the Frenchman's contract, and although that clause expired last month, Dembele's desire to seal the move saw Barcelona agree to the same terms. Having entered the final year of his contract at Camp Nou, Barcelona preferred to cash in on Dembele when it became clear he would leave for free next summer if he remained at the club. For Dembele, it's a return to Ligue 1 for the first time since he departed Rennes in 2016, with the 26-year-old inking a five-year contract at Parc des Princes. feed "I'm delighted to be joining Paris Saint-Germain and can't wait to play for my new club," Dembele told club media. "I hope I can continue to grow here and make all the club's fans proud." President Nasser Al-Khelaifi added: "We are delighted to welcome Ousmane Dembele to Paris Saint-Germain where he will be an important and committed player for our club. "The passion and determination shown by Ousmane as he has signed for PSG is fantastic and perfectly corresponds to the attitude required of all of our players. We are proud to be able to bring another French World Cup winner to Paris Saint-Germain as we enter a new great era for our club.    90min understands that PSG are also making progress in talks with Eintracht Frankfurt over striker Randal Kolo Muani, with the Bundesliga side now working on finding a replacement.
