Southampton and Brighton have been linked with a surprise move for Real Sociedad's former Manchester United winger Adnan Januzaj. The Belgian is struggling for game time in San Sebastian this season, only making two starts in La Liga so far.  His lack of minutes has given his suitors encouragement that a somewhat cut-price deal can be struck for the player. It's claimed that he could leave Real Sociedad for a fee of    25m, despite his current contract having a    60m release clause in it.

AC Milan and Roma have also been linked with Januzaj. (Various) However, it may not be that simple.  According to Belgian publication HLN, via The Sun, Januzaj remains a firm part of the Spanish club's plans. Loan offers for the winger from Roma and Milan were rejected in the summer and, despite only starting two league games this season, Sociedad are hoping to extend his contract which is due to end in 2022, rather than offload him to either Southampton or Brighton. The winger, who they signed in 2017, has been a fixture in the side since his arrival but has failed to deliver the same impact so far this campaign.  ? @AdnanJanuzaj    #AurreraReala pic.twitter.com/FQ7AtvaJUI Januzaj was labelled a starlet after breaking through to the Manchester United first team from their academy, but failed to live up to such heavy expectations. As Old Trafford lost its spark after the departure of Sir Alex Ferguson, Januzaj went on loan to Borussia Dortmund and Sunderland, before finding a permanent home at Real Sociedad.
