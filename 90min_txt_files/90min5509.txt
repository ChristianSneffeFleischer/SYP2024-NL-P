Espanyol midfielder Marc Roca is set to undergo a medical ahead of a move to Bayern Munich, after the Bundesliga giants agreed a deal worth around    15m including add-ons.  Following the departure of Thiago Alcantara to Liverpool this summer, as well as the expected exits of Javi Martinez and Michael Cuisance (although it remains to be seen where Cuisance will go after his Leeds move fell through), there is a need for Bayern to strengthen in midfield.  SPORT have now reported that Bayern have concluded a deal to sign Roca from Espanyol this for around    15m including add-ons. The three parties reached an agreement on Saturday, and all that now remains is for the player to undergo his medical examinations and officially sign as a new Bayern player.  The 23-year-old has agreed a four-year deal with Die Roten, while the club will also have the option to extend his stay by a further year. While Espanyol were relegated last season from La Liga after finishing rock bottom, Roca did draw plenty of attention from a number of clubs due to his impressive displays.  The midfielder started his side's first two league games of this season, but was not involved last time out against Real Oviedo through suspension and is also expected to miss Sunday's tussle with Sabadell on Sunday as he finalises his move to Bayern.
