Rio Ferdinand has revealed that spoke with Cristiano Ronaldo to convince him to reject interest from Manchester City and rejoin Manchester United. The Red Devils confirmed on Friday that they have reached an agreement with Juventus to bring the forward back to Old Trafford 12 years after he initially departed. However, it appeared on Thursday that he would instead be heading to Man City, and that he was even willing to take a pay-cut to go back on his promise not to join United's rivals. Ferdinand, who played alongside Ronaldo in his first spell at the club, has confirmed that he helped edge the transfer over the line and make sure that he did not end up at the Etihad Stadium. "Sir Alex Ferguson would have been the exact same, he would have hatred to see Cristiano in a Man City shirt, just like any other person that's been connected for a long time at this football club," Ferdinand said on Twitter via his fashion label, FIVE. "I rang him [Ronaldo] straight away, 'what's going on? Tell me you're lying'. [I said] every type of 'no, no, no' in the conversation. "'I'm like all the fans, I'm exactly the same and we are all the same like that. Please tell me you're not going'.  The video was recorded before the official announcement, but Ferdinand was feeling rather upbeat about what the rest of the day had in store.
