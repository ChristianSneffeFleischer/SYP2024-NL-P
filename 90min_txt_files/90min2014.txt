Chelsea have finalised an agreement to sign Monaco centre-back Benoit Badiashile, 90min can confirm. After failing to convince RB Leipzig to part ways with Josko Gvardiol in January, Chelsea turned their attention to Badiashile and quickly moved towards a deal which is expected to be worth just over  Â£30m. Personal terms were not an issue and were addressed early in negotiations, and sources have confirmed to 90min that Chelsea and Monaco have now reached a full agreement over a transfer fee. Paris Saint-Germain are understood to have shown late interest in the France international but Chelsea have managed to force through the transfer and he will now head to England to undergo a medical. Should all go according to plan, the 21-year-old will join a back line which already includes Thiago Silva, Kalidou Koulibaly, Trevoh Chalobah, Wesley Fofana, Marc Cucurella and Cesar Azpilicueta, and offer some much-needed help at the defensive end. Chelsea kept just their fifth clean sheet of the season against Bournemouth on their return from the World Cup break, a win which ended a run of five games without a victory and eased the pressure on Potter.
