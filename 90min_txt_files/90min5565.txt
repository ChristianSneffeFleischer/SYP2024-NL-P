AC Milan have expressed an interest in taking Manchester United right-back Diogo Dalot on loan for the remainder of the season. The 21-year-old was left out of the matchday squad for both of United's first two Premier League games this season and was an unused substitute during the Carabao Cup victory over Luton Town, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer preferring Aaron Wan-Bissaka and even Timothy Fosu-Mensah over the Portugal international. With United looking to raise money to finance some more signings this summer, Dalot has often been suggested as a potential casualty, and according to Sky Sport Italia, Milan have made it clear they're interested in signing Dalot. I Rossoneri have lodged a bid to take the versatile right-sider on loan with an option to sign him permanently at the end of the season, but United are reluctant to agree as they would prefer a permanent exit. The Red Devils have already rejected Milan's proposal, leaving the Serie A side considering whether or not it is worth pursuing a deal. Milan aren't looking to spend too much money this summer, but they hope to raise some additional funds by selling Lucas Paquet  , who has struggled to impress at San Siro and has been linked with the likes of Lyon, Valencia and Real Betis. Should Paquet   be sold, Milan may consider a fresh approach for Dalot, but it is suggested that they would prefer to reinvest that money in Saint-  tienne centre-back Wesley Fofana. A previous report from The Athletic noted that Solskjaer has not been impressed with Dalot's work rate in training and fears he is not aggressive enough on the pitch, which has seen the boss make him available for transfer. The problem for United is that there are few sides in Europe willing to come anywhere close to the  Â£19m they spent to sign him from Porto in the summer of 2018.
