From Tottenham Hotspur Stadium - Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta has been asked about the club's failed pursuit of Mykhaylo Mudryk for the first time. The Gunners had been locked in talks with Shakhtar Donetsk for the last few weeks over a deal for the winger. Though Arsenal were unwilling to meet a price-tag potentially eclipsing    100m, they were still confident of reaching an agreement. But their plans were scuppered when Chelsea swooped in and matched Shakhtar's asking price on Saturday night, swiftly confirming Mudryk's signing on Sunday afternoon. Speaking after Arsenal's 2-0 win at Tottenham in the north London derby, Arteta was asked how he felt about the club's top transfer target being snatched away from them.
