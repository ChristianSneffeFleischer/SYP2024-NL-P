Bayern Munich CEO Oliver Kahn has revealed that the club has held talks with Matthijs de Ligt and claims the Juventus defender wants to join Die Roten.  De Ligt has long been linked with a move to Bavaria this summer, with 90min recently reporting that Bayern are increasingly confident of securing his signature - after batting off competition from Chelsea.  Although personal terms have been agreed in principle with the player, negotiating a transfer fee is proving more challenging. 90min understands that Juve want    100m for De Ligt - which would make him the most expensive defender of all time.  Speaking about the move on Saturday, Kahn confirmed that talks were in progress.  "We talked. The player wants to come to Bayern Munich," he told  Bayerischer Rundfunk  .   "We'll have more talks and then we'll see how things go. I'm very careful about making any predictions."
