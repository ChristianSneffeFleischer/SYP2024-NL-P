Brighton want to sign Manchester United winger Daniel James and Tottenham centre back Joe Rodon in the summer transfer window. James' chances of being a regular at Old Trafford next season have taken a huge hit following the arrival of Jadon Sancho, while Spurs' pursuit of defender Takehiro Tomiyasu means Rodon could be available for transfer. The Sun reports that Graham Potter is keen to bring the two stars to Brighton in the summer in a move which would significantly bolster his side in both halves of the pitch. The signing of James would be a reunion for the pair. The 23-year-old worked under Potter during their time at Swansea City, and it was there that James rose to fame. The winger secured his move to Man Utd off the back of that electric form, but he has struggled to make a consistent impact in the Premier League. James impressed with Wales at Euro 2020 however, and demonstrated his true capabilities on the big stage. His arrival would add some significant pace out wide for the Seagulls, who are looking to improve on last year's 16th place finish. Potter is equally as determined to sign Rodon, who also shot to prominence at Swansea. The 23-year-old signed for Spurs in 2020 for a fee of around  Â£11m, and he initially caught the eye with some impressive defensive displays.
