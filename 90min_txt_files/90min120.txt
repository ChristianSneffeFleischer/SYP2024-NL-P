Roberto De Zerbi admits he's unsure what the future holds for midfielder Moises Caicedo but says Brighton will sign "another important player" if he leaves. Chelsea have seen several bids rejected by Brighton, the latest of which was worth  £80m. The Seagulls want  £100m to sell their star midfielder and recently made it clear to Caicedo why they are holding out for such a fee. Amid the uncertainty, Caicedo was left out of Brighton's final friendly on Sunday - a decision which chief executive Paul Barber publicly claimed was down to injury. "Moises had a slight hamstring injury late in training and was pulled out for that reason," Barber told Brighton media. "With a Premier League season just a week away it makes no sense to risk him today. We   re looking forward to Moises starting the season with us, he   s a Brighton player under a long-term contract." feed After the game, De Zerbi kept the focus on the transfer uncertainty surrounding Caicedo, confessing he did not know when he would see the Ecuador international again. "I don   t know [if he'll be back in training tomorrow]," he said. "If Moises leaves, we will find another important player. And if Moises stays, I will be happy for us, for the team, for the club. But it   s not my problem now. If Moises leaves, we will bring another player in. "We are Brighton, and under our policy there is the possibility to lose some players at the end of the season. It was the same for [Alexis] Mac Allister and [Levi] Colwill." 90min understands that Chelsea are expected to return with an increased offer for Caicedo, but have been searching for alternative targets amid concerns over the price tag.
