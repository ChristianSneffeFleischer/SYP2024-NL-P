Real Madrid and Manchester City both remain 'hopeful' that they can seal a deal for Borussia Dortmund midfielder Jude Bellingham this summer, 90min understands. Earlier this week, Liverpool made it known that they are not looking to pursue a deal for Bellingham this summer. That decision to withdraw is motivated by the finances, with Dortmund looking for    150m if the England international is to leave before next season. Whether Bellingham leaves this summer or not is a question he is yet to answer. Dortmund still have hope that he will commit to one more season with them by signing a new contract. If he does sign fresh terms in Germany, he will become the highest paid player in their history. But the contract would also include a generous release clause that could facilitate a transfer in 2024.. feed Bellingham is expected to confirm his intentions this month, at which point both Real and City will be ready to put their plans in place...or not. If Bellingham communicates he is ready to leave, Dortmund won't stand in his way but have made it clear to both the player's camp and his suitors that the price will be    150m - as already confirmed by 90min earlier this year.
