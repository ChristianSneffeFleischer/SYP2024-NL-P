Real Madrid right-back Achraf Hakimi appears to be closing in on a switch to Inter, after reports in Italy claimed that he's agreed personal terms with Antonio Conte's side. The 21-year-old has enjoyed two outstanding years out on loan with Borussia Dortmund but faces an uncertain future upon his return to the Santiago Bernab  u - as Real still have Dani Carvajal on their books. With Real choosing to delay their squad rebuild for at least one year as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, Hakimi was expected to find a new club instead of sitting on the bench for Zinedine Zidane's side, and Gianluca Di Marzio says he has done exactly that by agreeing a move to Inter. I Nerazzurri are looking to bolster the right side of their defence, with neither the ageing Antonio Candreva, the versatile Ashley Young or the on-loan Victor Moses seen as viable long-term options. A  £36m deal is understood to have been agreed between Inter and Real, and Hakimi has already given his approval to the move. ?

Conte's 3-5-2 system calls for all-action wing-backs, and Hakimi is exactly that. He has racked up nine goals and ten assists in all competitions this season, playing in a similar wing-back role on both the right and left side of the pitch. Dortmund have already found their replacement for Hakimi, having agreed a deal to sign Belgian Thomas Meunier once his contract with Paris Saint-Germain comes to an end this summer.
