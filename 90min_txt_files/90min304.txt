They were than able to focus their attentions on Diaby, who has previously been eyed by Arsenal and Newcastle United. However, Saudi Pro League side Al Nassr were their biggest rivals for the winger. 90min previously revealed that Al Nassr, who boast Cristiano Ronaldo for star power, were willing to pay Diaby an eye-watering sum to head to the Middle East, though Villa remained confident throughout negotiations that they would end up winning the race. feed And sources have now confirmed to 90min that Diaby will take Aston Villa up on their offer, with a medical the next step before he officially completes his move from Leverkusen. Diaby is believed to have prioritised a move to the Premier League despite the lucrative offer on the table from Al Nassr, wanting to test himself against some of the very best players in the world. Unai Emery's side will pay a fee in excess of  Â£43m for the 24-year-old, which will make him the club's most expensive signing in their history, and the deal reflects their ambition to challenge the Premier League's 'big six' and become regular fixtures in European competition.
