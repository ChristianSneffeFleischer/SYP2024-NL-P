Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel has stressed the importance of giving new signing Cesare Casadei time to adapt and settle at Stamford Bridge, but is impressed overall with the 19-year-old. Casadei completed his move to Chelsea from Inter earlier this month in a deal worth up to    20m. Having been a member of Inter   s under-19 squad last season, the midfielder won   t initially be part of Chelsea   s first-team but will make that step up eventually.    We need to give him time and not get overexcited because that would not do him a favour,    Tuchel told Chelsea   s official website.    He   s a box-to-box midfielder, very strong with his head, very physical for his age but at the moment it   s important that he learns the language, he learns what Chelsea is all about and understands the culture and the principles to live and play for Chelsea.    Then we will try and bring him to first-team training and open the doors for him. In the end, he needs to step through himself.    Chelsea have spent considerable money in the transfer market this summer, the first window under the new ownership led by Todd Boehly. The club   s recruitment has adhered to a clear pattern, with the Blues targeting both established players to immediately improve the first-team, but also young talents for the long-term future like the aforementioned Casadei and fellow teenagers Gabriel Slonina and Carney Chukwuemeka.
