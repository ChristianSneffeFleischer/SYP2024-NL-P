 Premier League clubs Leicester City and Wolverhampton Wanderers are both reportedly interested in Juventus centre back Merih Demiral.  Juventus signed the 22-year-old Turkey international 12 months ago for  Â£16.2m from fellow Serie A side Sassuolo. After spending the vast majority of the first half of the season on the bench - playing second fiddle to fellow summer signing Matthijs de Ligt - Demiral had battled his way into the starting lineup by the turn of the year.  However, Demiral's sixth consecutive start lasted less than 20 minutes as he suffered a severe cruciate ligament rupture against Roma in January - only returning to Juve's bench in mid-July.  While De Ligt has gradually improved after a prolonged run in the team - thanks in no small part to his teammate's injury - Demiral has garnered the interest of the Premier League pair Leicester and Wolves according to journalist Nicol   Schira.  Demiral may have scarcely featured for the defending Serie A champions but Juventus are thought to be reluctant to let such a prospect depart after one, injury riddled, campaign. Schira - a self-styled 'Expert in the Transfer Market' - claims that the club have reject a bid of    30m plus add-ons.  #Leicester and #Wolverhampton are interested in Merih #Demiral, but #Juventus don   t want to sell the turkish centre-back.

Just a week before his knee injury the Foxes had a bid for the talented centre back rejected by Juventus in January. The advances of Bundesliga side Borussia Dortmund were also swiftly batted away at a time when the club insisted they weren't open to any offers for the Fenerbahce youth product.
