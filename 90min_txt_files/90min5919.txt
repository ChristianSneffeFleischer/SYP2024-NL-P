Lionel Messi is on the market. Yes, really. One of the greatest footballers of all time is looking for a new club after he requested to leave his current club because they're, well...how to put this...a complete and utter shambles.  So when the third greatest footballer of all time comes on the market, as expected, clubs are more than happy to shamelessly link themselves with a move for him even if they don't really have a chance in hell of signing him.  Still, it's worth a try...right?  Here are the clubs who have, so far, taken to Twitter to plead with Messi to join their club. Our No.? jersey was free last time we checked...#Messi pic.twitter.com/pVbksLjrFu If it's a lovely new kit Messi is after, then they don't come much lovelier than Samp's.  Pensalo, Leo.? @mlaksman#TodoRojo ? pic.twitter.com/PbLC5RIEkt A Newell's Old Boys return is the real fairytale story, but they haven't had the gall to get a graphic designer to create a cartoon Messi wearing their kit. Independiente have, and we rate it.  ? pic.twitter.com/31l6bUHwZm Ganso (remember him?) probably won't be too happy with seeing Messi's name attached to his shirt number.  ? https://t.co/B4PUUVqp1q If Messi wants to play football in an industrial estate and eat the worst cheese burgers in the world - from experience, I can safely say that the burgers at United Park are horrific - then he should join Drogheda United.  ? pic.twitter.com/tlrrCoul8V Last Dance 2.  Lionel Messi's swansong plays out at the Chicago Bulls. The tiny Argentinian sits on a comfortable chair, looks into the camera and says: "they said I was too small to play basketball...and I took that personally."  Wonder if Messi has ever thought of trying out baseball ? pic.twitter.com/zJqOQOYUlf The move to the Chicago Bulls would be cool and all, but if Messi really wants to be like Mike then he'll leave the sport that he's the best in the world at to go play some Triple A baseball.            ,                                         ? pic.twitter.com/sPFUCa4nE8 For years the city of Moscow has been crying out for a footballing superstar to replace Aidan McGeady - who enjoyed four remarkable years at Spartak.  Lionel Messi could be that superstar.  ?....watch this space! pic.twitter.com/ECnJHiOvP4 The club that put hairs on Roy Keane's chest could do the same for Messi.  https://t.co/2R8SxMHg7Q pic.twitter.com/gq0uxswPYQ Messi has reportedly always wanted to live right smack bang in the middle of Ireland.        ?| Reunion on the cards, @HugoColace....We can dream! ? https://t.co/tIbNRINfAP pic.twitter.com/IbatBQb2YW From a quick Google Image search one can ascertain that Bangor is quite an aesthetically pleasing city and it has at least one Greggs.

He wishes. pic.twitter.com/zG8xUqcjHz Lionel Messi bloody loves Burger King.
