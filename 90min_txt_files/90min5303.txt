Chelsea are interested in signing Borussia Monchengladbach defender Matthias Ginter, according to reports in Germany. Frank Lampard invested heavily in his squad during the summer but still wants to strengthen further at the back. Despite recording a clean sheet in each of their last four games, doubts remain over Chelsea defensively and Ginter could be the man to shore things up. According to Kicker, Lampard is a big fan of the 26-year-old and wants to make a bid for the Germany international in January. Ginter played a key role in a Gladbach side that secured a fourth placed Bundesliga finish last season, making 36 appearances in all competitions. He has remained a pivotal part of Marco Rose's side this campaign and it is understood that a bid of around  Â£30m would be required to prise him away from Die Folen.  Ginter has earned praise from Germany legend Lothar Matthaus who recently compared him to Real Madrid star Sergio Ramos. "Ginter has become a leader at the back, in a similar way to Ramos at Real," he told Sky Germany (via Daily Mail). "He doesn't just give instructions to his team-mates, but leads them as well. That's what Ginter is doing really well at the moment. He reminds me of Ramos." Matthaus added: "He's full of confidence nowadays, and has become a big personality. "In the past, he wasn't as vocal and tended to follow the pack. Now he's taking on responsibility and making important decisions - defensively and in attack."
