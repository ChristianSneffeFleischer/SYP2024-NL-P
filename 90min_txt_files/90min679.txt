RB Leipzig have made it clear to Manchester City they expect a world record fee for a defender to sell Josko Gvardiol, 90min understands. City have long regarded Gvardiol as one of their top summer targets - already revealed by 90min in April - and now they are pushing on with talks for the Croatian star. Sources have confirmed to 90min talks between Gvardiol's representatives and City have gone well and personal terms are agreed 'in principle' leading to confidence that a deal will soon happen. Negotiations between the two clubs are now ongoing, with Leipzig seeking a sum that surpasses the  £80m that Manchester United paid Leicester for Harry Maguire in 2019 - the current world record transfer for a defender. feed Although City are keen not to go as high as the    100m ( £85.5m) Leipzig are looking for, they do recognise that a world record bid is likely required to get the deal done. With a deal already in place for Chelsea midfielder Mateo Kovacic, City are hoping to make Gvardiol their second Croatian signing of the summer as they unite the international colleagues. The Premier League and newly crowned European champions are looking to make room for Gvardiol in their squad next season with the sale of Spain international Aymeric Laporte, who is attracting interest from a number of the Premier League clubs including Aston Villa and Tottenham.
