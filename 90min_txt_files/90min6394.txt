Leeds United have confirmed the permanent signing of Wolves winger Helder Costa, securing his services on a four-year deal. Costa joined Leeds on loan ahead of the 2019/20 season from Wolves and has made 43 appearances in all competitions thus far for the Lilywhites. ? #LUFC are delighted to announce Helder Costa has now officially joined the club on a permanent basis Confirmed in a statement on the official club website, Leeds have paid Wolves a fee of around  Â£15m for Costa's signature - a fee agreed upon the signing of his loan deal last summer. The 26-year-old joins Marcelo Bielsa's side permanently having become a regular fixture in the club's push for promotion. He joined Wolves on a loan deal in July 2016 before making the move permanent the following January, and won the Championship Player of the Season for the 2016/17 campaign - scoring 10 goals and assisting another eight. This time around, he's scored six goals and added four assists in all competitions - with some of Leeds' fanbase still unsure that signing Costa to a permanent deal is the right deal for the club going forward. Instantly goes up in value if we get promoted. I'd say it's a good bit of business. Also if you look at Harrison's progress over time with Bielsa then I'd say its worth giving him the same time to improve Despite being an instant hit in his first season in England, he struggled to find his feet as Wolves took the Premier League by storm, and got lost in the shuffle. He managed just 25 appearances in the league, scoring once and assisting twice.
