Real Betis will attempt to lure Mamadou Sakho away from Selhurst Park when his contract with Crystal Palace expires at the end of the season, according to a report in Spain. Betis, managed by former Manchester City and West Ham manager Manuel Pellegrini, have got off to a slow start in La Liga, and currently sit 15th in the table after shipping a league high 23 goals in their opening 11 games. Palace, meanwhile, have been up and down in the Premier League, and have been without Sakho for the most part as he continues to struggle with injuries that have dogged him for the past 18 months. The Frenchman joined the Eagles from Liverpool for  Â£26m four years ago, penning a four-year deal upon his arrival. But with his contract up in the summer, Betis (via  Estadio Deportivo) are understood to be interested in securing his services as they target players who are out of contract. Pellegrini has already admitted that financial constraints brought on by the coronavirus pandemic has tied his hands when it comes to buying players, leaving Sakho a more than appealing option. Arsenal's Shkodran Mustafi and Napoli's Nikola Maksimovic are also noted as potential targets, though they don't possess the same positional flexibility that the 30-year-old offers.. One downside to moving for Sakho is his poor injury record of late. He's spent a number of weeks and months on Palace's treatment table, forcing Roy Hodgson to deploy Cheikhou Kouyat   out of position to fill the void. The Senegalese international has impressed in his new role, however, and has retained his place in the team even though Sakho is now fit and available again.
