Arsenal are contemplating a move for a free agent midfielder, 90min understands, with former Lille man Xeka being offered to the Gunners and other Premier League clubs. After failing with a handful of transfer deadline day bids for Aston Villa's Douglas Luiz, manager Mikel Arteta has confessed that he could still do with more players after Mohamed Elneny was ruled out with a significant thigh injury.

With the transfer market now closed until January, players not currently under contract at another club are the only possible way for Arteta to bolster his squad and sources have confirmed to 90min that the Gunners are exploring their options in the free agent market. Perhaps the top midfield asset yet to find a club is 27-year-old Xeka, who left Lille in the summer with 144 appearances for the French side under his belt.

Arsenal are one of those clubs to have been contacted although they are yet to make any firm offers and are instead exploring all the possibilities for their next move.
