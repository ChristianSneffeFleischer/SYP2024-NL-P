Wolves captain Ruben Neves has hinted at interest in joining Barcelona after admitting that "all players want to play" at Camp Nou. The 25-year-old has again impressed for Wolves this season despite their struggles, excelling both as a midfielder and as a makeshift centre-back. Neves has been linked to a number of bigger clubs for years but those links are now stronger than ever with talk of Barcelona wanting him. With Sergio Busquets set to leave at the end of the current campaign, Xavi and the Barcelona hierarchy are on the lookout for a replacement, and Neves is one of the potential successors under consideration. Recents reports in Spain have suggested the Catalan giants may even try to sign Neves in January rather than waiting until the summer - based on Busquets' relatively low level of performance in recent games. Scott Saunders  hosts  Graeme Bailey  and  Toby Cudworth  in the latest episode of Talking Transfers. The team discuss Chelsea's search for a new striker, the growing interest in Napoli rising star Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, Newcastle's plans for Bruno Guimaraes and more.

When asked about a potential move to Spain, Neves didn't hold back in his admiration for Barcelona, and said it was a privilege to even be linked with a move to Camp Nou.
