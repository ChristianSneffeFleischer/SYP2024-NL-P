Tottenham Hotspur have joined the race to sign Barcelona right-back Emerson, but face competition from several European suitors. The 22-year-old moved from his native Brazil to Spain in 2019 thanks to a joint financial effort from Barcelona - who officially own him - and Real Betis - who he has been on loan at ever since. The situation around Emerson's ownership is a complex one as he is co-owned by the two clubs. The Catalan giants own 50% of his rights but have the option to purchase an additional 30% from Betis this summer. According to the latest reports from Estadio Deportivo in Spain, cash-strapped Bar  a are looking to offload the defender in order to raise transfer funds ahead of the summer, and that they have set an asking price of  £21m.  Real Betis are said to want to keep hold of the Brazilian but it would be 'impossible' for them to sign him permanently given their current financial situation. That opens the door for Spurs, as well as PSG, Inter and Milan, who have all been credited with an interest. The right-back position has been a problem for Spurs this season. Having signed Matt Doherty from Wolves last summer for around  £15m, it's fair to say he hasn't lived up to his price tag and Serge Aurier has proven over the years he has an error in him.
