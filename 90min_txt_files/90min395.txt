Tottenham Hotspur chairman Daniel Levy met with Bayern Munich this week, sources have confirmed to 90min, with Harry Kane's future one of the topics of discussion. Bayern Munich CEO Jan-Christian Dreesen travelled to London on Thursday to have a face-to-face meeting with Levy as they continue their pursuit of Spurs captain Kane. Bayern have seen two bids rejected out-of-hand but Tottenham and their stance remains that Kane is not for sale. Tottenham sources insist that the meeting was not just about Kane, but the England striker's future was discussed. It is understood that Levy gave no price to Dreesen and offered no suggestion or encouragement that he would accept any bids.  feed Despite Levy's stance, Bayern are still expected to make a third offer which would represent a club record bid, as the Bavarian giants are convinced that Kane wants to move to the Allianz Arena. Levy accepts and understands why Kane would be tempted by other clubs, but 90min understands that he has made it clear to his captain's camp that they would make him one of the highest paid players in Europe if he signed a new deal and also laid out a map for him once his playing career comes to a close. Kane, for his part, has confirmed to the club that he is going on their Asia-Pacific pre-season tour, while his representatives continue talks with various parties.  Kane returned to training this week and met new Spurs boss Ange Postecoglou for the first time and club sources believe the initial meetings were hugely positive.
