Lazio reportedly see Andreas Pereira as a serious option as they look to strengthen their squad before the transfer deadline, and have 'opened talks' with Manchester United over a deal. The 24-year-old, who has amazingly been capped by Brazil at senior level, is no longer fancied at Old Trafford. He was a semi-regular in the early part of last season, but has been pushed down the pecking order since, and his last start of any description came in February.  The arrival of Donny van de Beek has deemed him further redundant, and he is one of a handful of fringe players the club are looking to offload before the window closes on 5 October. His underwhelming performances whenever he has featured mean there isn't exactly a queue around the block for his signature, but Sky Sports' transfer reporter Fabrizio Romano reports that they may have found a willing buyer in Lazio.  Lazio have opened talks with Manchester United to sign Andreas Pereira. He   s considered as an    option   , negotiations with #MUFC have just started. ? @SkySport #transfers It hasn't been given the 'here we go!' treatment just yet, as Romano notes that negotiations have 'just started' between the clubs. The Italian side, though, are said to see Pereira as a serious option, and are seemingly keen to conclude a deal over the next week or so.  Romano stops short of suggesting a fee, but other reports in Italy note that any deal is likely to be an initial loan with an option to buy in the region of    10m.  Pereira showed promise in the United youth ranks upon joining from PSV in 2011, and broke into the first-team initially as a holding midfielder. He has made 75 appearances for the club, featuring all over midfield, but has struggled to hold down a place in the side.
