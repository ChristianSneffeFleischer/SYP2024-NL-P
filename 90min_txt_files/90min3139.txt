Manchester United have held back a special promotional video for their new home kit amid uncertainty surrounding Cristiano Ronaldo's future at the club. Ronaldo has asked United to consider any suitable offers that arrive for him this summer, in the belief that he will be unable to fulfil his ambitions of claiming silverware and personal accolades at Old Trafford next season. At this stage only Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain have the will and finances to pull off a deal, and 90min understands the former are readying an opening bid. Bayern Munich have ruled themselves out of the running.
