Chelsea have completed the signing of French centre-back Axel Disasi from Monaco. A  Â£38m deal was agreed with Monaco earlier this week to bring Disasi, who was playing alongside current Blues defender Benoit Badiashile last season, over to Stamford Bridge. The deal is now complete, with 25-year-old Disasi signing a six-year contract to commit himself to Chelsea until 2029. "Axel has showcased his quality over several seasons in France and that has deservedly led to recognition on the international stage," said sporting directors Paul Winstanley and Laurence Stewart, the latter of whom joined from Monaco in February. "He is ready to take the next step in his career and we are delighted that will be with Chelsea. We welcome him to the club and look forward to him joining up with Mauricio Pochettino and his new teammates in the days ahead." feed Disasi becomes Chelsea's sixth signing of the summer, following Christopher Nkunku, Nicolas Jackson, Lesley Ugochukwu, Angelo and Diego Moreira in putting pen to paper on contracts at Stamford Bridge. A move for Disasi was accelerated after it was revealed that fellow defender Wesley Fofana had undergone surgery on an ACL injury which will keep him out for the majority of the coming campaign. Chelsea are well-stocked at centre-back, where Disasi's former Monaco teammate Badiashile joins Thiago Silva, Levi Colwill and Trevoh Chalobah as available options for the coming campaign. Pochettino enjoyed an unbeaten pre-season and will return to Premier League action when Liverpool make the trip to London on 13 August.
