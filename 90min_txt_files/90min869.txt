Kylian Mbappe has denied reports suggesting he is focused on joining Real Madrid this summer. The Paris Saint-Germain forward has made it clear that he does not intend to trigger the one-year extension in his current contract - a stance he later argued was made clear last summer upon the signing of his extension. Unsurprisingly, long-term suitors Real Madrid have been tipped to reignite their chase of the Frenchman this summer and Le Parisien went as far as to claim that Mbappe's sole focus is on moving to the Bernabeu before the start of next season. However, Mbappe took to Twitter to set the record straight and dismiss the claims. "LIES," he wrote in response to the story. "The bigger [the lie], the more it passes. "I have already said that I will continue next season at PSG, where I am very happy." manual The dilemma for PSG, however, is that Mbappe is currently on track to depart the club as a free agent at the end of the 2023/24 campaign and is able to discuss a contract with his suitors in just six months. Club sources insist that Mbappe, perhaps the most valuable footballer on the planet, will not be allowed to leave for nothing next summer. Real Madrid are understood to be keen to reignite their interest in Mbappe, not least because of the departure of Karim Benzema to Saudi Arabia. Club president Florentino Perez was recently captured on video admitting his intentions to sign Mbappe in the future but ruled out making a move this summer, although that was before the Frenchman's announcement on his future. Los Blancos have already agreed to pay in excess of    100m for Borussia Dortmund midfielder Jude Bellingham this summer and are looking for a handful of new forwards after Marco Asensio, Eden Hazard and Mariano Diaz all left the club for free as well.
