Zenit Saint Petersburg forward Malcom is attracting plenty of interest across Europe ahead of a potential transfer this summer, 90min understands. Malcom, formerly of Bordeaux and Barcelona, has enjoyed a sensational campaign out on the right side of Zenit's attack, racking up 23 goals and nine assists from just 27 top-flight outings this season. The 26-year-old is understood to believe he is ready for a return to one of Europe's top leagues and sources have confirmed to 90min that his agents have spoken with Zenit to try and engineer a move away this summer. Those same representatives have reached out to a number of sides from across Europe to try and find suitors for Malcom, and it is understood that plenty of teams have voiced an interest in getting a deal done. Indeed, 90min understands that Arsenal, Manchester City and Newcastle have all been alerted to Malcom's potential availability, while Paris Saint-Germain are also known admirers after failing to get a deal over the line in the January transfer window. feed Zenit are well aware of the interest in Malcom but, given he signed a new deal last summer to tie himself to the Russian side until 2027, they are prepared to demand a significant fee for his services. Sources have told 90min that Zenit are set to demand upwards of the  Â£40m with which they parted to sign Malcom from Barcelona in 2019. The Russian side are also braced for potential approaches for another Brazilian, 19-year-old defender Robert Renan. Renan, who only joined Zenit in January, has long been tracked by teams across Europe. Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Newcastle and Tottenham are all known admirers of the centre-back, who was handed a maiden call-up to the Brazil national team back in March.
