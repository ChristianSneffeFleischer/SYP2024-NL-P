Tottenham retain an interest in Wolves winger Adama Traore with the Spaniard about to enter the final six months of his contract, but they aren't alone in the race to sign him, 90min understands. Traore has gained a reputation as one of the Premier League's most talented but flawed footballers since moving to Molineux in 2018, scoring just 13 goals in 168 games for Wolves. He was part of Luis Enrique's Spain squad for Euro 2020 last summer but missed out on a place on the plane for this winter's World Cup, and his time at Wolves could be coming to an end. 90min has continually reported on Spurs' interest in Wolves, pre-dating the arrival of Antonio Conte to Nuno Espirito Santo's brief time in charge. Conte too is believed to be a big fan of Traore - he came close to joining as an option at wing-back in January 2022 before returning to Barcelona on a six-month loan instead. Harry Symeou hosts Jack Gallagher and Toby Cudworth to look back on Germany '06 as part of the 'Our World Cup' series. We take a trip down memory lane - join us!

Tottenham are reluctant to pay a relatively huge fee for him in January given that his contract is up next summer, but clubs on the continent are preparing pre-contract offers which could see them pip Spurs to Traore's signature.
