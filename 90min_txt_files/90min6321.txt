Barcelona have contacted Tottenham regarding the availability of Ryan Sessegnon, and are considering the possibility of a swap deal to make the move happen. Sessegnon joined Spurs from Fulham ahead of the 2019/20 season, but has struggled to nail down a regular place in the starting XI since making the switch. Barcelona are said to be long time admirers of 20-year-old Sessegnon and have been keeping tabs on him since his breakthrough as a teenager at Fulham. Sky Sports report that Bar  a have now made Spurs aware of their interest and are exploring the possibility of a swap deal this summer. La Blaugrana had already enquired about Spurs' record-signing Tanguy Ndombele with regards to a potential deal this summer, but have since cooled their interest in the midfielder after signing Miralem Pjanic from Juventus. Bar  a are willing to let go of several players in order to restructure their squad this summer, and there have previously been claims of Nelson Semedo and Samuel Umtiti being offered to Spurs. As for Sessegno, he joined Spurs in a deal worth  Â£25m last summer and despite struggling to break into the side so far, is focused on finishing the season before considering any potential departure. Spurs' hierarchy, meanwhile, are keen to see both Sessegnon and Ndombele used more frequently - considering the hefty finances involved in signing both players - but head coach Jose Mourinho is still yet to be convinced by the pair.
