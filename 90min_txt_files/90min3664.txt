How do you even improve this PSG squad? Sure, performances haven't always been great, but Mauricio Pochettino boasts the most terrifying squad on the planet and they're 13 points clear at the top of Ligue 1. There really isn't much you can do to make this team better. Having said that, PSG obviously aren't perfect, and there are a handful of things they need to get sorted in January. PSG's focus in January will be to trim the wage budget and reduce the size of the squad.Rafinha has already joined Real Sociedad and Sergio Rico, Thilo Kehrer, Abdou Diallo, Layvin Kurzawa, Leandro Paredes could all be shipped off when all is said and done.After that's done, we can start humouring the idea of new signings. Most of the talk about PSG in the summer of 2022 has revolved around Kylian Mbappe's expiring contract, but he's not the only player close to leaving for free.Young midfielder Xavi Simons, who is among the most wanted teenagers on the planet, is entering the final six months of his contract, and PSG must prove they want to keep him.Simons doesn't want money, but rather a clear path to the first team. He's played just one minute in Ligue 1 since joining the club in 2019, and that absolutely has to change.
