Benfica manager Roger Schmidt has revealed that Enzo Fernandez will rejoin first-team training after failing to secure a move to Chelsea at the start of the January transfer window. 90min reported earlier this week that the Argentine World Cup winner had missed at least one training session in frustration that a deal had not been agreed with the Blues and that he would face disciplinary action. Fernandez was omitted from Benfica's matchday squad for their narrow 1-0 win at home to Portimonense on Friday evening, with Chiquinho partnering Florentino Luis in midfield in his absence. But speaking to the media post-match, Schmidt said that Fernandez will return to the fold very soon. "It's clear what Enzo Fernandez did wasn't right, that   s why he wasn't in the team. I   m happy to announce from tomorrow I'll see Enzo in training," the German coach said. "He is our player, we need him...now Enzo can focus on Benfica and football again."
