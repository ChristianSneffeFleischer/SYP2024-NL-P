Chelsea and Arsenal are both interested in signing forgotten Southampton goalkeeper Fraser Forster, according to a report. Forster, who is on loan at Scottish Premiership champions Celtic, is currently third in the pecking order at St Mary's - behind Alex McCarthy and Angus Gunn - and has been out of the side for almost three years, when former manager Mauricio Pellegrino axed him following a string of indifferent performances. He's enjoyed somewhat of a resurgence at former club Celtic, though, playing 28 of the Hoops' 30 Scottish Premiership games as the Bhoys wrapped up a ninth consecutive league title - albeit prematurely after the coronavirus cut the season short in Scotland. Celtic are keen to make the deal permanent, but Football Insider claim that Chelsea and Arsenal are surprisingly in the running, as they seek to bolster their goalkeeping options. The report claims that Chelsea are interested in Forster because of the uncertainty regarding Kepa Arrizabalaga's long term future at the club. The Spaniard has made a number of high profile errors at Stamford Bridge, and his inconsistent displays have left the club questioning whether or not they should stick with their  Â£72m investment. Current backup Willy Caballero is on board for another year - after penning fresh terms - but is no spring chicken in terms of age, and isn't considered a permanent replacement by Frank Lampard and co. The Blues aren't the only ones interested in Forster, though. Arsenal are in the market for an understudy to Bernd Leno, as current number two Emiliano Martinez is keen to leave the Emirates Stadium in pursuit of regular first-team football.
