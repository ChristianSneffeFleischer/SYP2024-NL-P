Chelsea have failed to agree terms with Benfica over Enzo Fernandez after days of talks between the two clubs, though 90min understands the deal is not dead. The Argentine World Cup winner has emerged as Chelsea's top target for the January window and personal terms are already agreed with the 21-year-old - who has made it clear to Benfica he wants to join the west London giants. Chelsea, who have been using super agent Jorge Mendes to lead negotiations throughout the talks that have been ongoing since before Christmas, had been hopeful a deal was close after Benfica relented on their insistence that the deal had to see the player's    120m clause met in full. However, while Chelsea were hopeful of three fairly equal instalments of over    40m getting the deal done, Benfica want a big opening payment to let Fernandez leave, otherwise they are happy to keep him at the Estadio da Luz.
