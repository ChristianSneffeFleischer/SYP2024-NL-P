With COVID-19's halting of football leagues across Europe severely denting clubs' finances, the opportunity to snap up a seasoned professional without having to part with a transfer fee will not be overlooked. Free signings and swap deals will be the sort of transfers we'll likely see when the transfer window opens, and Chelsea's Pedro could be one of the many names we see linked with sides across the continent.

He's currently into his fifth season with the club since joining from Barcelona in 2015, but despite nearing his 33rd birthday, plenty of suitors are still eyeing his signature. It was revealed back in April that Roma had made a move for the veteran Spaniard, with Pedro since confirming he had a lot of offers from clubs, although a Blues stay was not entirely out of the question. Amid other interest from Juventus, Sevilla, Real Betis and Valencia, Il Tempo (via Football Italia), as well as reports in Spain, claim that Pedro has made Roma the 'priority' destination ahead of his expected Blues departure. Roma have been working on a deal to bring Pedro in for a number of weeks, and the latest batch of reports suggest that they've succeeded in their mission to have the forward swap London for Rome.
