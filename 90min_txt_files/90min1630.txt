FC Barcelona wants LA Galaxy right-back Julian Araujo. The La Liga club has submitted a second bid for the player, requesting a one-year loan spell with an obligatiory purchase option if certain goals are met, 90min sources confirm. The move would see Araujo replace Hector Bellerin, who is set to be joining Sporting Lisboa.   Sources add Araujo is strongly pushing for a move to FC Barcelona, speaking to the MLS club on the situation. He also previously affirmed his desire to move abroad in an exclusive interview with 90min.      I definitely want to go to Europe. It   s my dream. My goal is to go to Europe. I want to reach my highest potential and I feel like going to Europe is going to help me do that,    he said exclusively to 90min.      I   m someone that wants to learn everyday, someone that takes advice from everybody, that wants to learn. I know, like I said, to reach my highest potential I need to go play in the best, the top leagues.    FC Barcelona is not the first European team to come close to signing the player. He was previously targeted by FC Porto, Sevilla and Stade Rennes during the Summer window, given his 2022 MLS campaign.   In the case that Galaxy do not sell Araujo to FC Barcelona, the MLS team will offload the player in the Summer window.
