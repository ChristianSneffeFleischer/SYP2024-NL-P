Manchester United's prime summer transfer target Jadon Sancho is in a WhatsApp group with a selection of Red Devils players who he keeps in regular contact with. The Borussia Dortmund winger is being hotly pursued by United as they bid to strengthen their squad ahead of the 2020/21 campaign. But Dortmund are currently playing hard to get, reportedly holding out for    120m and setting a Monday deadline for the Red Devils to match their valuation.  However, according to the Transfer Window Podcast's Ian McGarry, United remain confident that they will land Sancho, with the 20-year-old making his eagerness to join the club clear by staying in regular contact with a number of United players.  This was backed up by Jesse Lingard, who told 90min in July that Sancho was one of a number of footballers that he plays Call of Duty: Warzone with. Interestingly, the Dortmund man was the only non-Manchester United player named in his gaming squad. "I play [Call of Duty] with Brandon Williams, Marcus [Rashford]," Lingard said. "Dan James plays it, [Paul] Pogba plays it, Victor [Lindel  f] plays it. Normally I play with Brandon, Rashy, Pogs, [Jadon] Sancho plays now and again. I mix it about." "Brandon, Rashy, Pogs... Sancho." ?Jesse Lingard talked to @benhainess about who the regular squad is when playing Warzone...@CallofDuty | #Warzone pic.twitter.com/rkt1vrmSZN McGarry added to this, telling the Transfer Window Podcast that Sancho regularly chats to many of his England teammates who are currently at United. "He [Sancho] has been in constant touch with England international colleagues who currently play for Manchester United and indeed in daily contact with them," McGarry said. "It's even believed he's on a WhatsApp group with some of the Manchester United players as well.
