Benfica president Rui Costa has warned the suitors of World Cup winner Enzo Fernandez that he will not be sold for anything lower than his    120m ( Â£106m) release clause. 90min understands that Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United have all contacted Benfica in recent weeks to enquire about a deal for Fernandez, who was also tracked by Manchester City during his time in Argentina with River Plate. Real Madrid are another club linked. Sources have confirmed that those suitors have all been warned privately that he will not be sold in January unless his release clause is triggered, and Costa has now reiterated that stance publicly. "We don't want to sell Enzo Fernandez in January, but we are willing to satisfy the boy in the event of an offer of    120m," Costa told DAZN. Reports in Portugal have claimed that Benfica manager Roger Schmidt has spoken personally with Fernandez to try and convince him to stay beyond January, but the boss refused to confirm the rumours in his latest press conference. "You always run the risk of losing players [in January]," Schmidt admitted when asked if he was worried about losing Fernandez.
