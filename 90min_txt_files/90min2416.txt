Donny van de Beek has been granted permission to leave Manchester United in the January transfer window, 90min understands. The Dutchman joined the Red Devils in 2020 to much fanfare, with the team in desperate need of midfield reinforcements. However, Van de Beek's United career has not quite gone according to plan. He made just four Premier League starts in his debut season, and after failing to impress interim boss Ralf Rangnick last year, was sent on loan to relegation-battling Everton. The arrival of Erik ten Hag, who coached Van de Beek at Ajax, brought fresh belief that the midfielder would finally break into the United team, but his compatriot has similarly used him sparingly. 90min understands that Van de Beek's camp have been informed by United they will not stand in his way if he wants to leave in January, though he is also able to stay and fight for his place. He is likely to leave on loan, and while there are Premier League clubs interested in his services, a move abroad is more likely. Former club Ajax, as well as rivals PSV Eindhoven are both interested, while he has other admirers from on the continent.
