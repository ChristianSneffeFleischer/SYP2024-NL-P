Arsenal are interested in signing Guido Rodriguez, although Real Betis are determined to keep hold of the midfielder this summer.  Rodriguez only arrived at Betis last January, signing from Mexican side Club America where he enjoyed a three-year stint. His first full season in Europe was a resounding success, with the 27-year-old carving out a reputation as one of the best defensive midfielders in Spain. Only one player made more tackles in La Liga last campaign, while Rodriguez also completed the third most pressures in the league.  His performances have attracted plenty of admirers, including Arsenal. According to Mundo Deportivo (via Ole), the Gunners are interested in signing Rodriguez this summer. The club are on the lookout for a new holding midfielder with the long-serving Granit Xhaka expected to join Roma before the start of the season.  Although Arsenal's interest is fierce, the deal could be tough to complete. Betis are keen to keep hold of the Argentine and will only sell if an offer that is too hard to turn down comes in. Rodriguez is thought to have a release clause of    80m ( Â£68.5m), of which his current side would receive 70% and Club America would get 30%.
