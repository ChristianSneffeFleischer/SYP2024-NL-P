Chelsea manager Graham Potter has refused to address whether the Blues will continue to try and recruit in the January transfer window. Nearly  £280m was spent on eight new players during the summer, with new owner Todd Boehly keen to revolutionise the squad. That included in excess of  £40m on teenage trio Carney Chukwuemeka, Gabriel Slonina and Cesare Casadei. Already in January, Chelsea have recruited 19-year-old striker David Datro Fofana from Molde. 90min understands a deal worth just over  £30m for Monaco centre-back Benoit Badiashile has also been agreed after failing to persuade RB Leipzig to sell the more expensive Josko Gvardiol. But when asked this week if there are particular positions the Chelsea recruiters are targeting, Potter declined to share any details.    The problem is that if I answer it and I   m specific with the answer then every single player in that area will be linked with Chelsea so I have to dodge it,    he said.
