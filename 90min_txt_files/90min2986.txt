Edu has admitted that Arsenal still have 'a lot to do' in the transfer window, and revealed that the club have to be prepared for 'every single situation' this summer.  The Gunners have already made five signings, bringing in Fabio Vieira, Gabriel Jesus, Matt Turner, Marquinhos and, most recently, Oleksandr Zinchenko.  However, despite being active in recent weeks, technical director Edu has insisted that he is not satisfied yet.  "I'm pleased, but to say how close is difficult because there's still a lot to do, we are in the middle of the transfer window and things can happen," he told the club's website.  "What we have to be is really focused and be prepared for every single situation, opportunities maybe can happen, clubs can sometimes come to us to see if there is a possibility to get players on loan or buy players. We just have to be prepared and I think we are very much prepared for almost everything." As well as hinting that further signings would be made, Edu also suggested that some players could be sold this summer.  "We have a plan for every single player in the squad and that's why I said there's still a lot to do in this transfer window because we have to balance the squad in the best way possible," he said.  "For the players who probably aren't going to have a lot of minutes here, we have to expose the players to have minutes in another place to keep developing the player, keep the player's valuation et cetera, so that's the way we plan it." Arsenal's pre-season is already well underway, with the Gunners defeating London rivals Chelsea 4-0 in their most recent friendly.
