Newcastle United remain keen to hold on to youth team graduate Matty Longstaff despite interest from clubs both in England and across Europe.  Longstaff marked his top flight debut in October by scoring the only goal in 1-0 win over Manchester United. The 20-year-old has made 15 appearances for Newcastle across all competitions this season but - following a breakdown in contract negotiations - is a now free agent.  After signing a short-term extension in June to cover the remainder of the 2019/20 season, Longstaff's contract expired on 31 July. Talks between the club and player reached an 'impasse' during the three-month hiatus enforced by the coronavirus outbreak, as the energetic midfielder was left unimpressed by Newcastle's offers.   However, Steve Bruce's side still want to keep Longstaff according to the Chronicle Live. Yet, if the Magpies are unsuccessful in their attempts to entice Longstaff to stay, they won't be left empty handed. Any clubs looking to secure the midfielder's services will be required to pay Newcastle compensation.  Fellow Premier League sides West Ham and Everton are thought to be interested in the England Under-20 international. While the Bundesliga club Schalke and Serie A outfit Udinese also retain an interest in the younger of Newcastle's Longstaff brothers.
