Liverpool are taking a keen interest in Egyptian winger Ibrahim Adel, who is being hailed as 'the next Mohamed Salah', 90min understands. The 21-year-old is currently with Egyptian outfit Pyramids but has been linked with a move to Europe for over a year since making his debut for the senior squad. A host of European clubs have been following his progress, and many believe he is the most exciting prospect Egypt have produced since Salah. Salah himself is believed to have made sure his bosses at Liverpool are fully aware of Adel's talent, and 90min understands their scouts were already familiar with him anyway. Adel was the subject of a bid from Danish outfit FC Nordsjaelland over the summer. They tried to buy him with a  £2m offer, but it someway short of Pyramids' valuation, which is believed to be at least  £5m plus add-ons.
