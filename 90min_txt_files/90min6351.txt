Chelsea have 'reached an agreement' to sign Trabzonspor  goalkeeper U  urcan   ak  r, according to reports in Turkey.    ak  r is one of the most highly rated goalkeeper outside of Europe's top leagues and has been capped twice by his country.  The 24-year-old was reportedly subject to a shock    24m ( £21.5m) bid from Liverpool in January, while he has also been linked with Tottenham and Leicester in the past. Now, it appears that Chelsea have become the latest Premier League side to enter the fray. According to Turkish outlet Haber 365, the Blues have agreed a deal with the talented shot shopper in the region of    33m ( £29.5m). No further details are provided in the report, meaning it should be treated with maximum caution. Saying that, it is no secret that Frank Lampard has often lost patience with the underperforming Kepa Arrizabalaga this season and the Blues could be in the market for a new goalkeeper.  The Spaniard arrived at Stamford Bridge for a world record  £71m  fee back in 2018 and despite some promising spells he has largely underwhelmed. A string of mistakes even saw him replaced by 38-year-old Willy Caballero earlier this season. IT'S DONE.
