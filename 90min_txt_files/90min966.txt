Sergio Busquets has revealed that he is keen to play for a team outside of Europe after leaving Barcelona. The legendary defensive midfielder left Barcelona following the conclusion of the 2022/23 season, bringing an end to a storied 15-year senior career at the club. In that time Busquets won three UEFA Champions Leagues, nine La Liga titles, seven Copa del Rey, three FIFA Club World Cups and also racked up the third most appearances in the club's history.  Speaking to The Guardian after his Barcelona exit, Busquets admitted that he does not want to play for another European club because he would not want to play against his boyhood club.  "I still don't have plans, honestly. I do have three or four options but nothing is done. I don   t want to play for any European team: it would be hard to face Barcelona with anything serious in play, and I want to live a calmer, more relaxed experience," he explained. "I would like things to get sorted quickly over the next two or three weeks.  feed "The decision will be mine and my family's, just ours. All of us have decisions to make now and maybe we will coincide, but there   s no plan." 90min reported back in March that MLS club Inter Miami were determined to sign Busquets at the end of his contract, having already sent an initial offer to the player's representatives.  The former Spain international also admitted that he intends to do his coaching badges with a view to becoming a manager in the future. "I would like to get my licence and prepare myself for it," he said. "I have an idea. The difficult part is managing a dressing room with 25 players, all with their egos. I'm interested to see if I can communicate with them, and convince them of what I want."
