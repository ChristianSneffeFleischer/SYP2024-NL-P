AC Milan have made a pre-contract offer to Porto midfielder Otavio as they look to sign the Brazilian on a free transfer at the end of the season. I Rossoneri have been one of the most active teams in the January transfer window as they look to retain momentum during their Serie A title battle. They recently brought in French midfielder Soualiho Meite on loan with an option to buy and there are plans to bring in others in the coming weeks, but one player who has been earmarked as a target for the future is Otavio. A Bola state that Milan have offered a four-year contract to the 25-year-old, who has also been approached by Fiorentina and two sides in Saudi Arabia. Otavio, whose preference is to stay in Europe, has been locked in talks with Porto for months, but the Portuguese side have been unable to reach an agreement just yet, opening the door for Milan to swoop in. It's yet another example of Milan's aggressive approach this month. After bringing in Meite, the club are also pushing to sign Chelsea centre-back Fikayo Tomori on loan with an option to buy, while free agent striker Mario Mandzukic is set to put pen to paper on a deal with the club. Footage emerged on Twitter of Mandzukic arriving at a hospital in Milan on Monday morning to undergo a medical with the Serie A side ahead of inking a six-month deal which could be extended by another season.
