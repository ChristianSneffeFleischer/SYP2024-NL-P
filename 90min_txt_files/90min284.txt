Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has reassured fans that the club will accelerate their transfer plans ahead of the 2023/24 season. The Reds are heading into the new term off the back of a hugely disappointing 2022/23 campaign in which they finished fifth in the Premier League and were dumped out of all three cup competitions at relatively early stages. Klopp, with the help of new sporting director Jorg Schmadtke, has sought to refresh the squad and has already welcomed Brighton's Alexis Mac Allister and RB Leipzig's Dominik Szoboszlai to his midfield ranks so far. Liverpool are, however, set to lose Jordan Henderson and Fabinho to Saudi Pro League sides Al Ettifaq and Al Ittihad respectively. feed Speaking on Liverpool's official club podcast, Klopp gave an update on his transfer plans for the rest of the summer. "My main focus and my main energy has to go into the training sessions, that's what I do," he said. "The time left and right of the sessions then I can try and sort other stuff, and that's what we are doing. "Still around three to four weeks until the first game of the season, a few things have to happen until then. Definitely. Transfer market-wise as well, that's clear now. "It will happen, and we will have a good team." 90min understands that Liverpool are considering Crystal Palace's Cheick Doucoure as a possible replacement for Fabinho, while they retain an interest in Chelsea centre-back Levi Colwill. Southampton midfielder Romeo Lavia is also being monitored by the Reds, though Arsenal and Chelsea are also weighing up a move.
