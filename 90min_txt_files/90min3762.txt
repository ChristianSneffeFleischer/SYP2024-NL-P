Thomas Tuchel is hopeful Antonio Rudiger and Andreas Christensen will sign new Chelsea contracts, with the German expecting "good news" soon.  Both centre-backs are on deals that expire at the end of the season with Tuchel keen that both remain at Stamford Bridge beyond the summer.  As 90min reported last month, Chelsea face the possibility of a defensive crisis if the situation is not remedied with Cesar Azpilicueta and Thiago Silva also free to leave the club in 2022 if they do not sign new contracts. Rudiger remains some way off an agreement, having previously requested to become the club's highest earner. Negotiations for Christensen's future have also slowed, with a deal previously looking all but done earlier this year. Speaking before his side's Premier League clash with Leicester City on Saturday, Tuchel gave an update on the future of each player. On Rudiger he said: "It is pretty clear what we want but it is not like this in football when the club wants something and things happen. "You have to accept that sometimes it can arrive and you end up in situations where things are in a delay and take time but I am very sure that Toni feels respected and knows what an important role he plays in this club." He added: "Things are mature, respectful and clear. Of course there are delays. With Andreas too, from my point of view, we wall want the same thing.
