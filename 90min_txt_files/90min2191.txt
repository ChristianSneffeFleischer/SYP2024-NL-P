Tyrell Malacia has insisted that Netherlands teammate Cody Gakpo is 'good enough' to play at the highest level amid interest from Manchester United. 90min recently revealed that Gakpo's performances at the World Cup helped convince Manchester United's hierarchy that the Dutchman is ready for a transfer to the Premier League.

Gakpo has scored three goals in four games at the World Cup, taking his domestic form with PSV Eindhoven into the tournament - the 23-year-old has 21 goal contributions to his name in just 14 Eredivisie games this season.
