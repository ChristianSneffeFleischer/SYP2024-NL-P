Arsenal are planning to send an improved bid to Lyon for star midfielder Houssem Aouar. Mikel Arteta is keen to add another central midfielder to the Gunners' ranks this summer and has identified Atletico Madrid's Thomas Partey and Aouar as his two priority targets. However, with the club reluctant to pay Partey's  £45m release clause, it appears their attentions have switched firmly to the Lyon dynamo despite already having a  £31.2m bid rejected by the French club.  Fabrizio Romano reports that the Arsenal board - alongside Arteta - are convinced that Aouar is a 'top player' and will continue talks with the player's agent ahead of an improved second bid.  L'Equipe (via Get Football News France), meanwhile, understand the 22-year-old is 'determined' to leave the Champions League semi-finalists during the current transfer window. Lyon are demanding a fee of  £54.5m for the supremely talented Frenchman's services this summer, and sporting director Juninho has made it clear the club aren't interested in any sort of swap deal which would see out of favour midfielder Matteo Guendouzi arrive at Les Gones. However, Aouar's desires might force the French club into selling for a reduced fee. Even so, Arsenal will have to oversee a fair share of departures if they are to fund a deal for the Lyon midfielder.  Emiliano Martinez and Lucas Torreira are two players who seem destined to depart north London this summer, with the former's stellar form to round off the 2019/20 campaign certainly increasing his number of potential suitors. Torreira, meanwhile, has attracted interest from a number of clubs in Serie A. Torino and Fiorentina are in talks with Arsenal over a potential deal. Another player who could exit the Emirates is full back Hector Bellerin.
