Barcelona president Joan Laporta has insisted that he does not want to sell Manchester United target Frenkie de Jong and also never has done in the past either. That is despite De Jong appearing to be on course for a Camp Nou exit during the summer. As 90min reported at the time, Manchester United agreed to pay    75m in guaranteed money for De Jong as part of a proposed deal worth up to    85m in total with add-ons. A breakthrough in the negotiations came when John Murtough and Richard Arnold flew to Catalonia for talks. De Jong was not keen to leave Barcelona but was advised by the club to explore a transfer amid the severe financial difficulties at Camp Nou. It was considered    impossible    at that stage for the Dutchman to stay with Bar  a, although the deal eventually collapsed. 90min understands that United boss Erik ten Hag, who worked with and developed De Jong at Ajax, has confirmed to the player   s representatives that he would still like to have him in Manchester. Even though De Jong   s public preference has been to stay, United maintain that the deal primarily fell apart in summer over complications relating to the millions of unpaid wages deferred from the height of the Covid-19 pandemic. That issue still hasn   t been resolved. Listen now as  Scott Saunders  hosts  Graeme Bailey  and  Toby Cudworth  in the latest episode of Talking Transfers.
