Marseille are ready to offer Wilfried Zaha a move to the south of France when his contract expires in 2023 with the Crystal Palace star considering the chance to play abroad, 90min understands. Talks between Palace and Zaha over a new deal have not progressed, with the 30-year-old ready to depart Selhurst Park for the second time in his career. The Ivory Coast international knows this could be his last chance to find a club who can offer him Champions League football - a competition he has never played in. Zaha moved to Manchester United in 2013, but the transfer failed and he ended up featuring just four times for the Red Devils. The clubs who can offer him Champions League football this time around are limited. In England, Chelsea considered a move for him last summer and they still have an interest, but RB Leipzig   s Christopher Nkunku and AC Milan   s Rafael Leao are very much their primary attacking targets. Arsenal have a long-standing interest too, but at 30 it's unknown if Zaha is seen as the right fit by Gunners chiefs Edu and Mikel Arteta.
