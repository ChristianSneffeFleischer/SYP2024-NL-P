Inter are continuing discussions with Manchester United over an extension on Alexis Sanchez's loan deal that would allow him to play the remainder of their Europa League campaign. A deal between both parties was agreed to allow Sanchez to remain in Italy for the rest of the Serie A season to cover football's postponement, but Antonio Conte's side have yet to reach an agreement that covers their European fixtures. A post shared by Alexis Sanchez (@alexis_officia1) on Jul 14, 2020 at 6:45am PDT Sanchez's current contract finishes at the start of August after Inter   s final game against Atalanta, but just a few days later they take on Getafe in the Europa League round of 16, which United have given the green light for him to play in. As per GIanluca Di Marzio, Inter are now asking United for permission to increase his time at San Siro beyond that fixture, with the club even offering to include a penalty fee should they meet the Red Devils in the final of the competition. As it is, Inter and United can only come up against each other if they make it into the final two. Unlike in the Premier League, there are no rules prohibiting a player on loan from facing their parent club in the Europa League, so Inter's view is that this special plea could encourage United to meet their desires. A loan deal to cover European football would simply be a temporary move - not in the literal sense - before Inter then discuss signing Sanchez permanently. This is something they are 'considering' ahead of the 2020/21 Serie A season, having been impressed by the Chilean's form of late.
