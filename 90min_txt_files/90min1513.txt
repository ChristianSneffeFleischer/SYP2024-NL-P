Arsenal legend and former Belgium assistant manager Thierry Henry has revealed that Romelu Lukaku is not keen to return to Chelsea at the end of his current loan to Inter. Lukaku came off the bench to score a late winner for Inter in the first leg of their round of 16 UEFA Champions League clash with Porto, heading home in the 86th minute to earn a narrow 1-0 win at San Siro.
