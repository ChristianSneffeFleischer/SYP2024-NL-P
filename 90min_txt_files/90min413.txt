Paris Saint-Germain are working on a deal to bring Joao Felix to the French capital, sources have confirmed to 90min. Felix began pre-season training back at Atletico Madrid this week, and in a meeting with club officials he confirmed that he is keen to leave the club this summer. 90min understands that Felix is particularly keen on a move to Paris Saint-Germain in order to work with new manager Luis Enrique.  Enrique has just arrived at the Parc des Princes, replacing Christophe Galtier, and sources have confirmed that he has shortlisted Felix as a potential summer signing for the Ligue 1 champions.  As it stands, Atletico Madrid are demanding around    90m for the forward's services, having paid more than    120m to sign him from Benfica in 2019. 90min understands that PSG would prefer a loan deal, ideally with an option to buy, but Atleti would want an obligation to buy attached.  feed Felix spent the second half of last season on loan at Chelsea - a loan which did not include an obligation to buy - and the club opted not to take up the opportunity to sign the Portuguese forward outright as he did not fit in with new manager Mauricio Pochettino's plans at Stamford Bridge.  Other English clubs have been linked and 90min understands that Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur, Newcastle United and Aston Villa have all been kept informed about Felix's situation by his representatives, however another loan to the Premier League is unlikely at this stage.  Felix's fellow countryman Bernardo Silva has also been heavily linked with a move to PSG, with 90min reported recently that the club are set to make a new bid for the Man City man now that Enrique has been appointed.
