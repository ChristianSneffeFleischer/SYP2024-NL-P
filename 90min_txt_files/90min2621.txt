Ajax have knocked back a    90m bid from Manchester United for Antony, 90min understands. The Red Devils have long since made the Brazil winger their number one attacking target this window and the player is keen on making the move to Old Trafford, missing several training sessions to try and force a transfer. However, Ajax are standing firm in their valuation and will not sell Antony for less than a record sale, and 90min understands that United's most recent bid of    90m is around    2m under that threshold. Antony is unhappy with the Ajax hierarchy as he believes this latest offer was certainly an acceptable one. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  &  Toby Cudworth  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Lucas Paqueta's potential move to West Ham, Chelsea's plans to sign Anthony Gordon, Wesley Fofana and Arsen Zakharyan and the latest from Old Trafford. Available on  all audio platforms  and the  90min YouTube channel. If you can't see the podcast embed, click  here  to download the episode in full! United are looking to bring in two forwards - one of which they hope will be Antony - before the transfer deadline, not least because of the uncertainty surrounding Cristiano Ronaldo's future. Anthony Martial recently picked up an Achilles injury to add to Erik ten Hag's attacking woes.
