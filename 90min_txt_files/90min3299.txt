Chelsea are also readying a bid for Lewandowski, but only if they are able to shift Romelu Lukaku off their books this summer. The Blues have delayed new contract talks with defender Reece James, but are not concerned by interest from Real Madrid and Manchester City.

RB Leipzig forward Christopher Nkunku is set to shun interest from elsewhere to instead sign a new contract with the DFB Pokal winners. Arsenal are continuing to monitor Real Madrid's 26-year-old winger Marco Asensio ahead of a possible summer bid. The Spaniard is expected to discuss his future at the Santiago Bernabeu next week.
