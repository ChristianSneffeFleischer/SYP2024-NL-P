Everton are considering Jesse Lingard as a possible replacement for Richarlison, 90min understands, and could rival West Ham for the free agent's signature. The Toffees completed the sale of Richarlison to Tottenham on Friday morning in a deal worth  Â£60m, ending weeks of speculation regarding the Brazilian's future. The money brought in from that deal will help Everton comply with Financial Fair Play regulations, though the Merseyside club still need to work on a tight budget across the summer window.  Lingard is officially a free agent after leaving Manchester United at the end of his contract, and the 29-year-old England international is a leading target for West Ham - who he enjoyed a tremendous loan spell with during the second half of the 2020/21 season. 90min understands that David Moyes is pushing for the club's hierarchy to complete a deal, which would likely see Lingard become one of the Hammers' highest paid players. Listen now to 90min's Talking Transfers podcast, with  Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey,  Harry Symeou  &  Toby Cudworth. On the latest show they discuss Richarlison's impending move to Tottenham, where Lisandro Martinez could be heading and more. Available on  all audio platforms  and the  90min YouTube channel.

However, West Ham may not get a free run at Lingard, as sources have confirmed to 90min that Everton have made contact with the England international's representatives over a possible switch to Goodison Park.
