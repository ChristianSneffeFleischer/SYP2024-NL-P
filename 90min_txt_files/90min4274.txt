Inter are lining up a move for Barcelona left-back Jordi Alba this summer.  The Nerazzurri look weak at left-back following the departure of Ashley Young to Aston Villa last week. This leaves 35-year-old Alexander Kolarov as the only natural, left-sided defender in the squad - and his contract is set to expire at the end of the month. According to Mundo Deportivo, Inter are eyeing Alba as the answer to their left-back woes. Their interest in the Barcelona man comes 12 months after they failed to sign his understudy, Junior Firpo.  The Brazilian was supposed to be used as makeweight in a deal that would have brought Lautaro Martinez to the Camp Nou, but negotiations eventually collapsed. Now, Inter have turned their sights to the more experienced Alba.  The defender has enjoyed a terrific Bar  a career since signing from Valencia back in 2012. He has made close to 400 appearances for the club and won a host of honours, including five La Liga titles and a Champions League.  Alba remains a key part of the team as well, missing just three league games last term. Despite this, president Juan Laporta has indicated that aside from Lionel Messi, Marc-Andre ter Stegen and a select few others, every member of the squad is available for the right price in the summer.
