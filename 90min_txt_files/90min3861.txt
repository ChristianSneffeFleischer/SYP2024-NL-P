Sevilla manager Julen Lopetegui has spoken out over Jules Kounde's failed move to Chelsea, stating that the Spanish club felt the transfer offers made by the Blues were insufficient.  The 22-year-old appeared destined to make the switch to Stamford Bridge on deadline day, but an agreement between the two clubs never materialised. Kounde was disappointed that Sevilla did not green light the transfer, but Lopetegui has explained the club made the right choice. "Kounde in the end has stayed because the club has decided that it was the right thing to do based on the evaluation of the offers they may have had," Lopetegui told  Diario de Sevilla. "For me, as a coach, it's positive that Jules is staying. With the evolution he has had in these two years, it is positive, without any doubt. "We trust that he   ll continue  to grow with us and, above all, perform, which is the most important thing." Lopetegui was speaking at the end of one of the summer's longest running transfer sagas, which left many Chelsea fans and Kounde himself extremely disappointed. The player is keen to make a step up in his career, and a move to the current champions of Europe seemed on the cards.
