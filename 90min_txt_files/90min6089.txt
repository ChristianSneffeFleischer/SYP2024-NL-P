With AFC Bournemouth's relegation from the Premier League confirmed after finishing just one point from safety in 2019/20, the club is now set for a carve up. The past weeks have seen long-term manager Eddie Howe leave the club by mutual consent, Ryan Fraser fail to extend his deal and Nathan Ake join Pep Guardiola's Manchester City in a transfer worth  £40m. Many more look set to move on, including David Brooks. The 23-year-old Welshman had an impressive first season after moving from Sheffield United in 2018, but his 2019/20 season has been plagued by injury. Fit and in-form, though, he has the ability to perform in the Premier League, and could be a bargain deal for many top flight clubs. Although David Moyes will be keen on bringing attacking players to West Ham, the Hammers are likely to be priced out of a move for the Bournemouth winger.The Cherries reportedly believe they can get up to  £35m for the Welshman, whose contract expires in 2022.Despite a chance to make the right wing position in the first-team his own, the finances involved may make the chances of a transfer to West Ham unlikely.Liklihood Rating: 4/10 The champions of England have also been linked with Bournemouth's Brooks, reportedly viewing the Welshman as a potential replacement for Adam Lallana, who has joined Brighton. Meanwhile, Xherdan Shaqiri's likely departure opens more doors for attacking places.Liverpool will know they need to bolster their squad depth if they are to challenge over a long period, but the club are not keen to spend big this summer, instead favouring value deals like  £11.75m Kostas Tsimikas.Would the Reds be willing to spend upwards of  £30m on a squad player? And would Brooks be willing to go, especially when there are other Premier League clubs willing to guarantee him first-team football.Liklihood Rating: 5/10 Jose Mourinho's side have some holes to fill in this summer's transfer window, but the wingers currently at the club mean this is not an area Spurs are desperate to improve.The Lilywhites' interest in Brooks has been reported for a few transfer windows now and it appears he is a player the club is watching closely. However, especially with the financial limitations of coronavirus, it is unlikely Spurs will be offering anything close to Bournemouth's reported valuation for a player who will not be guaranteed first-team football.Liklihood Rating: 5/10
