Newcastle United have agreed a club record deal with Real Sociedad for Swedish forward Alexander Isak, 90min understands. Isak has long been on Newcastle's radar, as 90min confirmed in July, but Sociedad had refused to let him leave this summer unless their valuation was met. Now, the Magpies have seen an offer worth    70m ( £59m) plus    5m in add-ons, and including a 10% sell-on fee, accepted by the Basque club. Isak had a release clause of    90m ( £76m) from a contract he signed in 2021 but La Real have deemed Newcastle's offer too good to turn down. Newcastle have been planning on a bringing in another striker all summer and had been working to a budget - but they have now pushed that to make their move for Isak. Newcastle's current number nine Callum Wilson has started the season in fine style, but potential injuries have always been a concern and he has already picked up a hamstring problem. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey,  Toby Cudworth  and  Harry Symeou  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Antony attempting to push through a move to Man Utd, Frenkie de Jong and Pierre-Emerick Aubayemang's futures at Barcelona and Arsenal's interest in Pedro Neto.
