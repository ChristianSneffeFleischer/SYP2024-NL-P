West Ham United are nearing an agreement with Lyon for the transfer of Lucas Paqueta after overnight talks between the two clubs, 90min understands. The Hammers launched a second bid for Paqueta on Thursday worth in excess of    50m, but were met with resistance by Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas - who has a reputation for being a tough negotiator. Sources told 90min on Thursday evening that the move was in serious jeopardy, with West Ham seemingly unable to match Lyon's hefty demands, but talks continued through the night in a bid to find an agreement. 90min understands that the clubs are now close to finalising an agreement over a deal worth    60m including add-ons, with Paqueta having already agreed personal terms with West Ham over a five-year contract. The 24-year-old has been at Lyon for two seasons after a year in Italy with AC Milan, quickly establishing himself as one of the standout players in Ligue 1. He contributed 15 goals and assists in 32 Ligue 1 appearances during 2021/22, and is also an established international for Brazil - making 33 appearances to date.
