Juventus vice president Pavel Nedved has insisted Cristiano Ronaldo and Andrea Pirlo will remain at the club beyond this summer. The Old Lady have endured a turbulent campaign during Pirlo's first season as manager, with the rookie boss failing to mount a serious title challenge and even facing the prospect of missing out on Champions League football. Juventus' 3-0 humbling at the hands of Milan at the Allianz Stadium on Sunday saw them drop out of the top four, leaving their Champions League aspirations hanging by a thread with just three games of the season remaining. Such a wretched campaign has naturally led to speculation over Pirlo's tenure, though Ronaldo's time at the club has also been called into question. Despite his stellar individual stats since arriving in Turin nearly three years ago, Ronaldo has failed to lead the club to glory on the European stage - something which undoubtedly drove his mega-money signing - and Juventus have often produced some of their best performances without the Portuguese superstar in the team. With speculation beginning to grow over the respective futures of the pair, vice president Nedved was asked about the possibility of Ronaldo and Pirlo leaving the club this summer, though he quashed such suggestions despite admitting it had been a tough campaign.    There are some difficulties, but we   ll fight until the end,    he told satirical Italian television show Striscia La Notizia (via Football Italia).    Pirlo and Ronaldo will stay at Juventus." Nedved's public backing of Pirlo in particular is just the latest vote of confidence offered to him by the Juventus hierarchy.
