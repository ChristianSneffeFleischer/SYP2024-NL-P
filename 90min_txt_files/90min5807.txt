Leeds have opened talks with Barcelona regarding midfielder Rafinha Alc  ntara, but the two clubs are currently some distance from an agreement being reached. Rafinha has spent much of the last two and a half years out on loan, and Barcelona are keen to offload the 27-year-old permanently this summer as part of an overhaul at Camp Nou. According to Spanish news outlet Sport, the Brazilian is eager to move to the Premier League in order to follow in the footsteps of his brother Thiago - who has been linked with a move to Liverpool all summer. Negotiations between Leeds and Barcelona are in the early stages, with the Spanish side holding firm on their valuation of    16m - although the Yorkshire outfit are hoping that as the talks progress Barcelona will consider lowering their initial asking price.

He broke into the first team in 2011, but he has spent the bulk of the last two and a half years away from Camp Nou. Rafinha joined Inter on loan for the second half of the 2017/18 campaign, before completing a season-long loan move to Celta Vigo in 2019. The Brazil international scored four times in 30 appearances for Celta, and the Spanish outfit could rival Leeds for Rafinha's signature - but are unlikely to be able to match the fee that Barcelona are demanding.
