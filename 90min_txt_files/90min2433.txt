Everton forward Anthony Gordon has described the state of transfer fees in football as 'absolutely crazy' after a record-breaking summer in which Premier League clubs spent  £1.9bn on new recruits. Gordon, 21, was himself the subject of two bids from Everton's Premier League rivals Chelsea, the latter of which was worth around  £60m.  However, the Toffees told the Blues Gordon was not for sail and successfully held onto one of their brightest young talents, having already seen Richarlison leave to join Tottenham in a  £50m deal. Speaking publicly on his transfer saga for the first time, Gordon admitted he feels transfer fees are out of control in football. "That   s football nowadays - it   s absolutely crazy," Gordon said. "Personally, I don   t think any player is worth that amount of money but I   m also not going to talk myself down. "The money in football, that   s just how it is nowadays. You   re also paying for potential all the time these days. That   s just how football goes." Gordon also said he was wary of growing over-confident based on the rumours of Chelsea's interest in him. He added: "I wasn   t too focused on that because I can only control what I can control. "I think the minute you do that [thinking he is a  £60m player], there   s only one way you   re going to go. "You need to stay humble. You need to focus on today and tomorrow and don   t look too far into the future. "That   s part and parcel of football. When you   re doing well, there   s always going to be that speculation. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey,  Toby Cudworth  and  Sean Walsh  bring you a brand new episode of Talking Transfers.
