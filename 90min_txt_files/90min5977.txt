Chelsea are confident they have won the race to sign Brazil centre-back Thiago Silva on a free transfer after his contract with Paris Saint-Germain expired. The 35-year-old, who played his final game for the French side in Sunday's Champions League final defeat to Bayern Munich, has been speaking to the Blues for a few days over a potential deal, but his desire to seal a two-year contract was expected to be a problem for Chelsea. However, a source has confirmed to 90min that Silva has agreed personal terms with Chelsea, who have moved to the front of the queue for his signature and are set to make him their third signing of the summer after Hakim Ziyech and Timo Werner. Silva's representatives have also fielded calls from Tottenham Hotspur and Everton, but the Blues have done enough to convince Silva to move to Stamford Bridge. Sky Sports News add that Silva will sign a one-year contract, rather than the two years he was initially searching for. That appears to confirm previous reports that Chelsea see Silva as the ideal stopgap to temporarily help address their defensive woes while the Blues focus their spending on other areas of the squad this summer. Silva managed 315 appearances for PSG in all competitions and was still a core part of the French side up until his final game, and Chelsea are understood to be enamoured by his wealth of experience at the highest level. Silva may not be the only new face at Stamford Bridge in the coming weeks, with deals for Bayer Leverkusen's Kai Havertz and Leicester City's Ben Chilwell both moving in the right direction - the latter of whom is closest to a transfer. Should the Blues manage to get all those deals over the line, that would leave only the goalkeeper position to address this summer.
