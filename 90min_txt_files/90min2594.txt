West Ham have finalised the signing of Brazilian midfielder Lucas Paqueta from Lyon. Paqueta was among Newcastle's top targets for a large part of the transfer window but late interest from West Ham has seen the 25-year-old head to London Stadium instead in a deal worth close to    60m ( Â£50.9m).    I am extremely happy to be here. I hope it   s the beginning of an enjoyable journey. I hope my time here is successful,    Paqueta said    Last season, West Ham had a very good season and I hope they continue to enjoy more and more good seasons in my time at the club.    I am excited to pull on the West Ham shirt and show the fans what I can do, to help my teammates and the club.    Manager David Moyes added:    I   m delighted to welcome Lucas to West Ham.    He   s a player I   ve admired from afar for a very long time and of course, we saw him close up in our Europa League campaign last season.    He   s a very talented footballer and whilst he will need time to adapt to the Premier League, we   re excited about adding another proven international to our squad.    West Ham's move for Paqueta looked to have collapsed as quickly as it emerged last week following a failed    50m bid, with the Hammers contemplating walking away over concerns they would not be able to meet Lyon's demands.
