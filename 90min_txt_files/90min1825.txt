Bournemouth are set to continue talks over the weekend regarding a potential deal for Bristol City forward Antoine Semenyo, 90min understands. Semenyo has scored three times in his last four appearances for Bristol so far this calendar year and Bournemouth are seeking additional firepower after averaging under one goal per game in the Premier League halfway through this season. The Cherries had hoped that a  £10m offer for the 23-year-old would be enough, but that bid has been knocked back his current club. On this edition of Talking Transfers, Scott Saunders hosts Toby Cudworth & Graeme Bailey to discuss all the big transfer stories. This week's agenda includes Jude Bellingham, Harry Kane, Declan Rice, Hakim Ziyech, Leandro Trossard, Pedro Porro, Mykhaylo Mudryk and more!

Championship leaders Burnley were another of the sides interested, but have instead turned their attention to South Africa international Lyle Foster at  £6m.
