Manchester United are reported to have failed with a late  £25m offer on transfer deadline day to sign Watford winger Ismaila Sarr, who emerged as one of two major alternatives to Jadon Sancho. United were unable to sign Sancho after failing to strike a deal with Borussia Dortmund, whose valuation of the England international was firmly set at    120m. There was much talk of an approach for Barcelona wide-man Ousmane Dembele, which proved to be the subject of much on/off speculation in the final 24 hours of the summer window. It was rumoured that Dembele was initially against a move, then for it, with Barcelona refusing to entertain a loan, then warming to it. But in the end there was no formal offer on the table, he stayed put at Camp Nou and that was that. Sarr briefly appeared to be more a realistic alternative once United accepted defeat on Sancho, despite misplaced confidence of being able to conclude a deal. The Manchester Evening News reported that United did make a late offer Sarr, asking to take the Senegal international on a season-long loan initially. The proposed deal is also said to have included a  £25m option to make it a permanent transfer next summer. But Watford said no. Sarr was a club record signing for the Hornets just last summer at around  £30m, which means accepting  £25m would have represented a loss. It is also worth noting that they let two other wingers - Gerard Deulofeu and Ignacio Pussetto - join partner club Udinese on loan on deadline day. Allowing Sarr to leave the club as well, unless for a vast offer upwards of  £40m, would have reduced wide options even more.
