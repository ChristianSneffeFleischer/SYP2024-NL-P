Erik ten Hag has told his Manchester United bosses that he is now open to Cristiano Ronaldo leaving the football club this summer, 90min understands. Ronaldo made it clear to United as early as June that he wanted to leave Old Trafford after just one season back at the club - primarily because he wanted to play Champions League football. United and Ten Hag were quick to go on the defensive and insist that Portuguese legend would not be allowed to depart. But after a further meeting between all parties in July, it was again confirmed to the club that 37-year-old wanted his future to lie away from United. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  &  Toby Cudworth bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Erik ten Hag wanting to sign five players before the transfer window closes, and Man Utd's attitude to selling Cristiano Ronaldo. There's also talk on Chelsea's interest in Anthony Gordon, and much more. Available on  all audio platforms  and the  90min YouTube channel.

Bayern Munich, Paris Saint-Germain, Chelsea and Atletico Madrid have all been linked with moves for the Portugal captain, although some clubs have stated publicly they are not in the market for him. However, Ronaldo's agent Jorge Mendes firmly believes there are clubs ready to make a move for the player this month - as long as United agree to his exit.
