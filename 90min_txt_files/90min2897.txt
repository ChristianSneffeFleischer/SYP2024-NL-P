Chelsea have swooped to sensationally agree a transfer with Aston Villa for contract rebel Carney Chukwuemeka. The 18-year-old has enjoyed a dream summer, starring for England Under-19s in their European Championship success and scoring twice in the final against Israel. Chukwuemeka only had a year left on his contract at Villa Park and 90min understands he had rejected Villa's renewal attempts to this point. The player was subsequently left out of the Villans' pre-season tour to Australia. The midfielder was wanted by several clubs across Europe, but from seemingly out of nowhere, Chelsea confirmed an agreement to sign him on Tuesday afternoon, with sources telling 90min they will pay a fee of  Â£20m. A joint statement between the clubs read: "Aston Villa and Chelsea can confirm that the clubs have reached an agreement for the permanent transfer of Carney Chukwuemeka. "The 18-year-old has been given permission to travel to London to discuss both personal terms and undergo a medical."
