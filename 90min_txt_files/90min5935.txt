Juventus stalwart Leonardo Bonucci has rejected the chance to join Manchester City this summer, in favour of staying in Turin. The Cityzens signed Bournemouth defender Nathan Ake in a  Â£40m deal earlier this month, but are understood to be in the market for another centre-back. ?

City have made previous attempts to bring Bonucci to the club - most notably in 2017, when the Juve man instead opted for a controversial switch to Milan - and have made a renewed effort to sign the defender this summer.  But, Sky Sports Italia's Gianluca Di Marzio reports City have been unsuccessful in their bid to bring Bonucci to the Etihad. Di Marzio notes that despite being flattered by Guardiola and the Cityzens' interest, he's opted to stay at Juventus and support new manager - and former teammate - Andrea Pirlo, who's attempting to oversee the start of a successful rebuild period in Turin.  Despite Bonucci's rejection, it's also understood that City never made an official bid to the Bianconeri for their stand-in skipper for the 2019/20 campaign. The Italy international is keen on finishing his career at Juve, a club which he has appeared 407 times for across eight seasons after joining from Bari in a    15.5m deal back in 2010. So, with Bonucci off the table, City are set to pursue a move for Napoli's Kalidou Koulibaly.
