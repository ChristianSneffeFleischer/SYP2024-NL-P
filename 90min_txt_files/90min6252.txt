Manchester City target Ferran Torres looks to have taken another step towards his proposed move to the Etihad this summer, after fellow suitors Borussia Dortmund pulled out of the race to sign the Valencia star.  Der BVB have been keeping a close eye on the young Spaniard for some time now as a replacement for the possibly-departing Jadon Sancho, and sporting director Michael Zorc even travelled to Spain to watch the youngster in action against Atalanta in February.  But according to Bild, the German giants were left unconvinced by the winger's performances for los Murcelagos, and they do not consider him to be dangerous enough in the final third to justify his hefty transfer fee.  One club who certainly can afford his    35-40m price tag, however, is Man City. The Citizens will be desperate to upgrade their squad in the summer transfer window, following a miserable domestic campaign.  Pep Guardiola's side surrendered the Premier League title to Liverpool after two years on the throne, and the Spaniard will be hoping for some on-field investment to mount an attack on the Reds.  Although most of Man City's frailties come within their defensive recruits, they are also looking to bolster their attacking alternatives, and Torres has been strongly linked with a switch to the Etihad stadium this summer, to fill in for the departed Leroy Sane.  The 20-year-old would welcome a move to Manchester too, as he is excited by the prospect of working with Guardiola, and learning under the former Barcelona boss' tutelage.
