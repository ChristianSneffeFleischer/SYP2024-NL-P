Manchester United have told interested parties that midfielder Scott McTominay is not available for transfer in January, 90min understands. McTominay has been a regular fixture in the United starting XI for a number of seasons since his breakthrough under Jose Mourinho, but has this term lost his starting role for the most part following the signings of Christian Eriksen and Casemiro. Both players were signed with authorisation from current manager Erik ten Hag, and their introduction has led to a sharp upturn in form under the Dutch coach. Interest in McTominay has emerged with his role reduced from a number of Premier League rivals, but it's understood Ten Hag sees McTominay playing a big part in United's future. The Scotland international, now 26, is a United academy graduate and is also understood to be happy at Old Trafford as it stands, showing no signs of agitating for a move away in spite of interest shown in him. 90min has learned no official bids have been made, but the likes of Everton, Southampton, Leeds, West Ham and Leicester have all asked about the player's situation. Each have been looking to know about the midfielder's availability but United have quickly ruled out any chance of McTominay leaving either on loan or on a permanent deal.
