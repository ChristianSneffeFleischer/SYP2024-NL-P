Valencia captain Jose Gaya is on the radar of Barcelona as they look to bolster their defensive options this summer. Bar  a are keen to add some depth to their backline and have already secured the signing of right-back Emerson Royal from Real Betis. The Brazilian will compete with Sergino Dest for the right-back spot and Barcelona's transfer team have now turned their attention to the opposite flank. Jordi Alba has cemented his place as the club's first-choice left-back since his arrival from Valencia in 2012, and the Catalan giants are now exploring the possibility of raiding Los Murcielagos once again, with Gaya a potential target. Mundo Deportivo report that the Spanish left-back is one of Barcelona's main targets this summer, with current backup left-back Junior Firpo seemingly on his way out of Camp Nou. Gaya still has two years remaining on his deal at Valencia, though their current financial plight means they may once again be forced to part ways with some of their key men in order to generate cash. Valencia had hoped to tie their captain down to a long-term deal, but talks have broken down with Gaya expressing his dissatisfaction over the club's performances in recent seasons. Barcelona's director of football Mateu Alemany knows Gaya from the pair's time at Valencia together and is understood to be a big fan of his, though - as with any deal - the possibility of the two parties coming to an agreement is likely to rest on the fee being demanded by Valencia, with Barcelona themselves experiencing financial woes.
