Liverpool have announced that teenager Neco Williams has put pen to paper on a new long-term contract with the club. The 19-year-old was one of a number of youngsters to make his first-team bow for the Reds in the Carabao Cup during the 2019/20 season, and he went on to feature 11 times in all competitions for the senior side. The Wrexham-born right back, who joined Liverpool aged six, even collected a Premier League winner's medal, having featured in six Premier League matches for the Reds during their title-winning campaign. ? @necowilliams01 has signed a new long-term contract ? The 19-year-old commits his future to the champions     Speaking to the Liverpool club website following the extension of his Anfield stay, Williams said: "It feels amazing. At the minute for me, I think there is no better place to learn and to become a better player than being here and working with the lads.     For me personally, especially learning off Trent and Robbo every day, getting their advice, seeing what they say, it   s only going to make me a better player and I feel it.    I take it day by day and I am maturing in my game, I am developing as a player and, like I said, I don   t think there is a better place for me to work and keep going at it than here.    Last season was my breakout season, but I think the more games I play now, the more I train, I feel I am becoming a better player.    I am learning massively     there is no better place to be at the moment.    Though he featured on both flanks in 2019/20, Williams will likely serve primarily as the understudy to Trent Alexander-Arnold in 2020/21, following the arrival of left back Kostas Tsimikas from Olympiacos.
