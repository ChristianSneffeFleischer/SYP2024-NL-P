Atletico Madrid have agreed terms with Caglar Soyuncu over a free transfer to the Civitas Metropolitan Stadium this summer, sources have told 90min. The defender's contract with Leicester City expires at the end of the season and terms over a new deal have not been agreed. 90min first reported in January of Atletico's pressing interest in Soyuncu on a Bosman deal, while Los Rojiblancos initially had hope of even signing him that month. The Turkey international ended up remaining at the King Power Stadium, but 90min understands he is now set to sign a pre-contract agreement with Atletico ahead of a summer move. Sources say that Liverpool and Newcastle United were among several English sides who expressed an interest in Soyuncu, but talks failed to advance and so he will be heading to Spain instead. Soyuncu was also the subject of offers from clubs in Germany and Italy.
