Brighton midfielder Moises Caicedo has confessed his ultimate goal in football is to win the Champions League with Real Madrid. The Ecuador international was targeted by both Arsenal and Chelsea during the January transfer window and even publicly pleaded to be granted an exit from Brighton, only to eventually sign a new contract when his wishes were denied. Since then, Caicedo has continued to flirt with his various suitors, recently admitting he wants to see Arsenal go on and win the Premier League title. Now, however, Caicedo has conceded that his dream move is actually away from English football, naming Real Madrid as his favourite club. "It was always my dream to play for Real Madrid," Caicedo told SER, naming Los Blancos as the 'best team in the world'. feed "I'm doing things very well now; so why not join Real Madrid one day and win the Champions League? It's my biggest dream. "It's very nice to see how Madrid plays and the personality that players like Vinicius [Junior], [Eduardo] Camavinga, [Federico] Valverde have. I also really enjoy watching [Toni] Kroos. To play for Madrid you have to work very hard." Asked about the pressure that comes with all the Premier League interest in his services, Caicedo insisted he knows how to keep his cool and focus on having fun. "The only thing I want is to have fun on the pitch," he stressed. "The pressure doesn't affect me.  "What I want to do now is to win titles and listen to the Champions League anthem, it's my next step. I might even cry when I hear it."
