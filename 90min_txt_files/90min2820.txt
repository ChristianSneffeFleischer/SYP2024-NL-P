Everton have confirmed the signing of Wolves and England defender Conor Coady on a season-long loan for the 2022/23 campaign. 90min revealed earlier on Monday that Coady and midfielder Idrissa Gueye were undergoing medicals on Merseyside, with Amadou Onana also due to be unveiled as a new signing. The Toffees have brought the defender to Goodison Park on an initial loan and his arrival comes as a boost after defenders Ben Godfrey and Yerry Mina suffered injuries in the 1-0 defeat to Chelsea on Saturday. Coady himself was left out of the Wolves side that was beaten 2-1 by Leeds at the weekend.    It   s incredible to join Everton,    Coady told evertontv.    As soon as I heard the interest, from the manager but also the football club itself, I really wanted to be part of it straight away. I   m over the moon to join.    I   ve grown up around the city, I know the football club, how big this club is and what it means to the supporters. I   m someone who was desperate to come here, to play for this club. I   ve got family and friends who are massive Evertonians.    I   m here to give absolutely everything I   ve got for this football club. It   s important I work as hard as I can to help my teammates, help the club move forward and make people proud.    Manager Frank Lampard added:    We are delighted to bring a player of Conor's quality and vast experience to Everton and he fits into how we want to play as a team.    As well as being one of the Premier League's most reliable defenders and an England international, his leadership skills will be of huge benefit to us, too.
