Barcelona midfielder Nico Gonzalez has completed a transfer to Portuguese giants Porto. Spain Under-21 international Nico made his Barca debut in 2021 under Ronald Koeman, having renewed his contract that year until 2024 with a whopping    500m release clause. His deal at Camp Nou was then extended to 2026 before departing for a loan spell with Valencia. Things went poorly at the Mestalla as Los Che narrowly avoided relegation in 2022/23, with Nico scoring once in 26 La Liga appearances. feed Barca have now announced his permanent    8.5m departure to Porto, who finished second in the Primeira Liga, and have a buy-back clause should they wish to bring the midfielder back to Camp Nou. The La Liga giants also retain a percentage of any future transfer fee for Nico. New summer arrivals Ilkay Gundogan and Oriol Romeu made Nico's pathway to starting XI football more difficult under Xavi, who already had the likes of Pedri, Gavi, Frenkie de Jong, Sergi Roberto and Franck Kessie to choose from in midfield. He is the latest Barca player to leave this window following the previous exits of Sergio Busquets, Jordi Alba, Samuel Umtiti and Alex Collado. Alongside Gundogan and Romeu, the reigning Spanish champions have also brought in Inigo Martinez on a free transfer from Athletic Club and signed Brazilian forward Vitor Roque to come into effect in 2024/25. They are hopeful of completing more business before the window closes, too. Barca have long been interested in Manchester City's Bernado Silva, though the treble winners are ready to stand firm to stop the Portugal international leaving following the recent departure of Riyad Mahrez to Saudi Pro League side Al Ahli.
