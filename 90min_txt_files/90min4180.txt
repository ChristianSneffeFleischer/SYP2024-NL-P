Anderlecht midfielder Albert Sambi Lokonga will undergo a medical with Arsenal ahead of the completion of his switch to the Emirates. The 21-year old Belgian has been linked with Mikel Arteta's side for a while this summer, with an opening bid of around  Â£13m reportedly being rejected by Anderlecht in the middle of June. However, according to Belgian journalist Sven Claes, the deal is set to be completed soon, with Lokonga undergoing a medical on Friday. Should he successfully complete the medical tests, the 21-year old would join his new team mates next week for pre-season in Scotland. Update: ? ? ?

He has been integral to Anderlecht since the 2019/20 campaign, making 56 Jupiler Pro League appearances over the last two seasons and helping the club to a third-placed finish last term. The midfielder has also earned recognition on the international scene, having represented Belgium at Under-17, Under-19 and Under-21 levels. Lokonga has also been called up to the senior side by Roberto Martinez, although didn't manage to get off the bench in the country's warm-up matches prior to Euro 2020.
