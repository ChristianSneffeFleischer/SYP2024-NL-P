Raphinha is continuing to wait for Barcelona to finalise an agreement with Leeds United but remains hopeful of completing a move to Camp Nou this week, 90min understands. The Brazilian forward has been the subject of bids from Arsenal and Chelsea this summer, with the latter agreeing terms with Leeds. Chelsea have since been trying to finalise personal terms but have not been able to strike a deal, as the player and his agent, Deco, have continued to try and manoeuvre a transfer to Barcelona. 90min revealed last week that Bar  a have agreed to match Chelsea's offer, but that was only a verbal understanding and finer details - including how much will be paid in add-ons - have not been finalised. Barcelona would like to pay in instalments and over an extended period of time, but sources close to Leeds and other clubs around Europe are wary of such agreements with the Catalan club given the clear financial mismanagement that has beset them in recent years.
