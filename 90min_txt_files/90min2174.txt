The New England Revolution have bolstered their attack with the signing of ex-USMNT forward Bobby Wood. Wood joins on a one-year deal through the 2023 MLS season with an option for 2024, with the Revs acquiring him with the first pick in Stage 2 of the Re-Entry Draft after Real Salt Lake declined to retain him.    We are excited to welcome Bobby Wood to the New England Revolution,    Revs sporting director and head coach Bruce Arena said in a club press release.    I   m very familiar with Bobby, having coached him on the international stage with the United States, and I   m very confident that he   ll be an excellent addition to our attack here in New England.    Now 30 years old, Wood joined RSL in the summer of 2021 and went on to score six goals and provide two assists in 34 appearances across all competitions. However, he hasn't played since June after undergoing adductor surgery. Prior to arriving in MLS, Wood spent over a decade in the top two tiers of German soccer, turning out for 1860 Munich, Union Berlin, Hamburger SV, and Hannover. The striker scored 10 goals in 72 Bundesliga outings, while he also hit the net 24 times in 112 2. Bundesliga appearances. At international level, Wood picked up 45 senior caps for the United States between 2013 and 2018, scoring 13 goals and providing five assists. His last appearance for the Stars and Stripes came in a 1-0 friendly defeat to Italy in November 2018.
