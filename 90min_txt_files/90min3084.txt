Tottenham are not rushing to tie Harry Kane down to a new contract despite reports of interest from Bayern Munich, 90min understands. The England captain's current deal expires in 2024 and reports in Germany have suggested Bayern fancy their chances of being able to sign him next summer as a belated replacement for Robert Lewandowski, who is expected to join Barcelona this window. 90min reported back in May that Kane and Spurs shared a mutual interest in opening talks over a fresh contract, and while this is still the case, both parties are happy with the current situation and aren't rushing discussions. Kane is happy at Spurs under Antonio Conte and the general mood around the club is better than it was a year ago when Nuno Espirito Santo was appointed as head coach after a lengthy process. Club owners ENIC have recently shown their ambition by pumping  £150m into the club following the 2021/22 season, withdrawing  £100m for immediate use on transfers for this window. Listen now to 90min's Talking Transfers podcast, with  Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey,  Harry Symeou  &  Toby Cudworth. On the latest show they discuss Chelsea turning to Antony and Serge Gnabry as Barcelona close in on Raphinha, why Manchester United have still not signed Frenkie de Jong, Manchester City's pursuit of Marc Cucurella and their interest in Jules Kounde and Pau Torres.
