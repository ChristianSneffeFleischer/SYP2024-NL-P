Thomas Muller has admitted he'd have 'no problem' leaving lifelong club Bayern Munich if the time came, and hinted that he'd like to follow in Thiago Alcantara's footsteps in his move to the Premier League.  The 31-year-old joined Die Roten as a child and has spent more than 20 years at the club, making over 600 appearances and scoring more than 200 goals in that time.  Despite his synonymity with Bayern, Muller admitted during an interview with The Times that he would have 'no problem' leaving the Bundesliga giants in the future, and likened his situation to that of Thiago, who joined Liverpool in the summer.     I   m not fixed to this club. I have a special relationship, I loved Bayern before I started playing for them, but when there is a situation where you have to decide maybe to play for a different club it would be no shame and no problem at all.  "Maybe like with Thiago (Alcantara, now at Liverpool)," Muller teased.  Thiago spent seven years in the Bundesliga and had just won the Champions League when he decided it was time for a fresh challenge, asking to be allowed to leave the club in the summer. He dreamt of a move to England, and Liverpool obliged, signing the midfielder for around  Â£20m.  So, could we see Muller in the Premier League next season? He confessed that he likes the country, although his grasp of certain accents and dialects is not at its peak.     I like it. But some cultures... speaking and such, special dialect, I don   t understand everything. Newcastle? Ah, I don   t know...
