Newcastle have failed in their pursuit to sign Idrissa Gueye on loan from Paris Saint-Germain, despite holding initial talks. Gueye has fallen out of favour in Paris in recent months and is free to leave the club as a result. Newcastle are in search of a midfielder, but are yet to use the January transfer window to strengthen their squad and are running out of time. L'Equipe initially reported that Newcastle had made contact over a loan move for the 31-year-old, but the Daily Mail have since confirmed that Gueye has turned down the chance to return to the Premier League with Steve Bruce's side. The midfielder was signed by then-PSG manager Thomas Tuchel for a reported  Â£29m fee in summer 2019 and has made 16 appearances this season but has featured in limited capacity, having completed just one full game since October. Gueye is now struggling to find a regular place in the side under the new management of Mauricio Pochettino, with a change of system taking him out of the side. Pochettino has been in pursuit of Dele Alli since taking the PSG job, with the England midfielder out of favour at Tottenham.
