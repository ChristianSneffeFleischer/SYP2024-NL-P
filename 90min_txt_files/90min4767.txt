Former Atletico Madrid striker Diego Costa is in negotiations with Brazilian side Palmeiras after leaving the Wanda Metropolitano. Costa made just seven appearances for Atletico in the first half of the season, popping up with two goals, before being released from his contract in December 2020. A potential move to the Premier League in January failed to materialise, and now Sky Sports News state that Costa is in talks over a move to Palmeiras, the club he supported when he was a child growing up in Brazil. He is currently in Brazil for the negotiations, with Palmeiras offering him a two-year contract worth in the region of  Â£2.6m per season. Marca in Argentina also back up those claims, even going a little further by suggesting that the deal could be closed early next week, although reports coming out of Brazil have done their best to pour some cold water on things. According to Globo Esporte, Palmeiras are keen to land Costa but are reluctant to break the bank to sign the 32-year-old, whose high wages go against the recent transfer strategy employed by the Brazilian side. Club officials are said to have confirmed that no negotiations with Costa have taken place, with a move for Costa said to be 'highly unlikely' unless things change. It's noted that Palmeiras found themselves in a similar situation with winger Hulk, who left Shanghai SIPG in January to seek a return to Brazil. Palmeiras rejected the move, preferring long-term signings over recruiting big, expensive names like Hulk, whom they watched join Atletico Mineiro instead. Costa is not believed to have made a decision on his future just yet. As well as negotiations in Brazil, the Spaniard has also spoken with sides in Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia since leaving Atletico in December.
