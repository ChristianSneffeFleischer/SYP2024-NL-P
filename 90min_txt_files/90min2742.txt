West Ham United have agreed a deal with Paris Saint-Germain to sign central defender Thilo Kehrer for a fee of    12m plus add-ons, 90min can confirm. The German international is in London to undergo a medical and to finalise personal terms having outlined his desire to join West Ham ahead of Sevilla. Kehrer, who arrived at the Parc des Princes from Schalke four years ago, had less than a year remaining on his contract at PSG and the Ligue 1 champions have opted to cash in now rather than risk losing him on a pre-contract agreement in January. The 25-year-old's move to London Stadium could be completed in time for him to be available for Thursday's Europa Conference League qualifier against Danish club Viborg, which would provide a huge boost for David Moyes' injury depleted squad, and the transfer could end up costing West Ham    15m in total. Summer signing Nayef Aguerd is sidelined after undergoing ankle surgery, Craig Dawson is out of action with a hamstring injury and Angelo Ogbonna is simply not fit enough to play as he continues to recover from anterior cruciate ligament tear suffered last season. Issa Diop, meanwhile, has left to join Fulham. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  &  Toby Cudworth  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Erik ten Hag wanting to sign five players before the transfer window closes, and Man Utd's attitude to selling Cristiano Ronaldo.

Should Kehrer put pen to paper as expected he will become the club's sixth major signing of the summer window. The Hammers have already signed Aguerd, Alphonse Areola, Flynn Downes, Gianluca Scamacca and Maxwel Cornet, but there's a desire to add further bodies before the September deadline.
