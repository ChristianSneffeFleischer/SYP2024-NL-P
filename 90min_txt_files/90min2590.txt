Manchester United have agreed a deal to sign Newcastle goalkeeper Martin Dubravka on loan with an option to make the move permanent. Dubravka has slipped down the pecking order under Eddie Howe having been the Magpies' number one before Nick Pope arrived in the summer. Howe revealed contact from United over the Slovakia international last week, stating: "There has been contact between the clubs and those discussions will continue." 90min now understands the deal with United is done, with just personal terms and other smaller issues to work out. There will be an obligation for the Red Devils to make the transfer permanent should he play a certain number of games. Dean Henderson's loan to Nottingham Forest opened up a number two spot behind David de Gea at Old Trafford. The likes of Alex McCarthy, Kevin Trapp, Yann Sommer, Odysseas Vlachodimos, Daniel Bachmann and Giorgi Mamardashvili all emerged as potential options, but Dubravka was ultimately decided as their primary target. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  &  Toby Cudworth  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Lucas Paqueta's potential move to West Ham, Chelsea's plans to sign Anthony Gordon, Wesley Fofana and Arsen Zakharyan and the latest from Old Trafford.
