The Portland Timbers have re-signed defender Josecarlos Van Rankin on loan from Liga MX side Chivas, the club announced Tuesday. Van Rankin was a big hit in Portland last season, playing 41 times for the club across all competitions, providing six assists as they went all the way to the MLS Cup final before eventually losing to NYCFC on penalties. The Timbers have now secured the services of the one-time Mexico international again through the summer, with an option to extend the loan until the end of the 2022 season. Portland also have an option to make the transfer permanent.    We are delighted to welcome Josecarlos back to the club. He was a very good addition to our backline last season, and a phenomenal addition to the locker room,    general manager and president of soccer Gavin Wilkinson said in a press release.    We   re thankful we were able to collaborate with Chivas to make this happen and look forward to working with a talented player and great person like Josecarlos.    We have re-signed Josecarlos Van Rankin on loan through the summer, with a team option to extend for the remainder of the year.
