Real Madrid have confirmed the signing of Turkish sensation Arda Guler from Fenerbahce, just an hour after Paris Saint-Germain confirmed the arrival of winger Marco Asensio. The 18-year-old was one of the most in-demand players around when his    17.5m release clause became active and both Real Madrid and Barcelona lodged bids to try and lure Guler away. Guler ultimately chose Real Madrid, whose offer of    20m is above Guler's release clause but, importantly, can be paid in instalments. "Real Madrid CF and Fenerbah  e SK have agreed on the transfer of the player Arda Guler, who will be linked to our club for the next six seasons," a brief statement read, before confirming his presentation to the media on Friday. Guler, who has four senior caps for Turkey to his name, leaves Fenerbahce after notching 21 goal contributions in 51 appearances, comprised of nine goals and 12 assists. feed Primarily an attacking midfielder, Guler has spent plenty of time out on the wing and will likely help fill the void left behind by the departures of Eden Hazard and Marco Asensio - the latter of whom has been confirmed as PSG's latest signing. Asensio has signed a three-year contract in the French capital after spending eight years at Real Madrid. He won three La Liga titles, three Champions League crowns, four Club World Cups, three UEFA Super Cups, two Spanish Super Cups and last season's Copa del Rey in that time, and is a mainstay in the Spanish national team. To compensate for his departure, Braham Diaz has returned to Real, extending his contract to join Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo in Real Madrid's attacking line. There are still plans to sign a new striker following the departure of Karim Benzema, with PSG's Kylian Mbappe their top target and Tottenham's Harry Kane an option.
