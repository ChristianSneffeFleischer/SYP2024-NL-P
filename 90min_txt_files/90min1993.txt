Barcelona head coach Xavi has played down suggestions that his side will have a busy transfer window, indicating he is happy with the 'winners' in his current ranks. La Blaugrana spent heavily in the summer transfer window on the likes of Robert Lewandowski, Raphinha and Jules Kounde after activating a number of financial 'levers', selling off other parts of the club in order to receive immediate cash injections.  Although they have crashed out of the Champions League at the group stage once again, Barcelona currently sit top of La Liga, level on points with Real Madrid but ahead on goal difference. They've also conceded just six goals in 15 games. They have been linked with several incomings and outgoings in the January window, but speaking to the press on Tuesday, Xavi was quick to pour cold water on suggestions of major squad upheaval this month. "We are who we are and we are happy. This team are winners. They want to win and they show me in every training session. I am very happy with what I have," the Spaniard said.
