During his four complete seasons in Portugal, the full-back has laid on 39 league assists, collecting two league titles in the process. Manchester United priority: left back and right winger. Possible also a CB. Tonight #MUFC have been in contact again with Alex Telles agents. He will push to leave Porto on next few days. Man Utd are monitoring and considering an opening bid.

This news comes just days after United had supposedly already agreed personal terms with Telles. Porto's number 13 is one of three left-backs Manchester United had targeted this summer. The club lost out on Sergio Reguilon after Premier League rivals Tottenham Hotspur snapped up the 23-year-old. Telles played the full 90 minutes of Porto's opening fixture at home to Braga on Saturday - scoring twice and assisting the other in a 3-1 win - but Romano reports he will 'push to leave' the club in the coming days. United finished a distant 33 points behind champions Liverpool last season and have only made one signing so far - bringing in Dutch midfielder Donny van de Beek. However, manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer insisted that the club are still 'working' on signings. Saturday's 3-1 home loss to Crystal Palace will have done little to alleviate fans' concerns.
