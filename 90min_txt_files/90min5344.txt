Chelsea and Kepa Arrizabalaga will both have to take a financial hit if the goalkeeper is to secure a move away from Stamford Bridge. Kepa is Chelsea's club record signing, with the Blues paying    80m to bring the Spaniard to Stamford Bridge in 2018, but following a patchy 2019/20 season in west London he has lost his number one spot. The Blues brought in Edouard Mendy from Rennes during the transfer window, but the Senegal international was nursing a thigh injury on Saturday and Kepa returned to the side for the Premier League clash with Southampton. However, the 26-year-old produced an error which cost his side all three points as Chelsea could only muster a 3-3 draw with the Saints. Mendy returned to the starting XI for Chelsea's 0-0 draw with Sevilla in the Champions League on Tuesday evening, and Frank Lampard confirmed at full time that the former Rennes man was currently his number one goalkeeper. "At the moment yes, he's shown his quality. The way he's played, he's played very well, that's two clean sheets for him already," said Lampard [via the Daily Mail]. "As it stands he is [first choice] but that's always up for grabs. But the way he's playing I'm very happy." That leaves Chelsea with the    80m Kepa warming the bench, and according to Spanish news outlet Estadio Deportivo [via Sport Witness], both the club and player would have to make financial sacrifices if a move elsewhere is to materialise.
