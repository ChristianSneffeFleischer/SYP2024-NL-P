Raul Ruidiaz is looking to leave the Seattle Sounders this winter. The Peruvian striker has played a key role in the Sounders' success over recent years, scoring 61 goals in 96 appearances across all competitions since joining from Atletico Morelia in 2018. Nine of those goals have come in MLS Cup Playoff appearances. During that time, he's helped fire the club to MLS Cup in 2019, as well as the final in 2020 and this year's Leagues Cup final. Seattle only recently exercised their option to extend Ruidiaz's contract through the 2022 season, with head coach Brian Schmetzer revealing a new deal was on the horizon.    He   s going to get rewarded after the end of this year with a new contract, and that   ll be great,    Schmetzer told reporters (via Sounder at Heart).    The team is hopefully going to keep him around for another few years.    But those contract talks now appear to have broken down. According to Pulso Sports' Nick Negrini, Ruidiaz "does not feel valued" in Seattle and is actively seeking a move away. ? #Lo  ltimo Ra  l Ruid  az busca salir de @SoundersFC y hay m  s de un club dispuesto a pagar por llevarse a la 'Pulga'.
