Serge Aurier has confirmed he is looking to leave Tottenham, with a return to Paris Saint-Germain one touted option. The defender joined the club in 2017 for around  £23m from PSG. Since then he has gone to make over 100 appearances in all competitions. His Spurs career has been tumultuous at times, though, making several high profile mistakes and suffering from various fitness problems. His current deal is set to expire in 2022 and in an interview with L'Equipe he confirmed he would not be extending his contract. "Without tongue in cheek, everyone is aware that if I wanted to extend to Tottenham, I would have done so already," Aurier said. "I   m not going to do it in six months. I have known the Premier League, a Champions League final. I have reached the end of a cycle and it is time to look elsewhere." With Aurier's time in England at an end, attention will now turn to his next move. PSG, where he enjoyed a fruitful two year spell between 2015 and 2017, have been linked with a  £9m switch. The right-back is said to be open to a return, despite leaving in acrimonious circumstances when he was banished to the reserves for insulting then manager Laurent Blanc.
