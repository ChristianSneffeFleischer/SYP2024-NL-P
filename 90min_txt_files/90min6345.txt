Brescia remain adamant that they will not accept any offer lower than their    50m asking price for midfielder Sandro Tonali. The 20-year-old has grabbed the attention of some top Italian clubs with impressive performances all season, and Brescia look set to sell him in the upcoming transfer window thanks to overwhelming pressure from some high-profile sides.  La Gazzetta dello Sport report that Brescia are standing by their initial asking price of    50m for Tonali, but his contract situation     set to expire in 2022, with a cut-price sale likely if he doesn't leave this summer     means that they may be forced to bend a little on that if no fierce bidding war breaks out. Tonali has attracted interest from across Serie A, with teams from Juventus to Inter and Milan all battling it out to sign the 20-year-old. Although they are vying to sign the midfielder, all three clubs are only prepared to offer    30m. The reluctance to spend big is likely due to the coronavirus pandemic, and the financial implications it will have on football clubs and the transfer market     although the Old Lady and Milan have budgetary issues of their own making, of various degrees.  Tonali has made 29 league appearances this season, with one goal and six assists to his name, but despite his best efforts the Lombardy club are currently facing relegation to Serie B, sitting 19th and seven points adrift of safety with just six games to go. Brescia are keen to sell Tonali for a sizeable financial gain, accepting that they will not be able to keep him if they are relegated     although anything they receive will likely obliterate their long-standing record sale, when they received    14m for midfielder Matuzal  m in 2004.
