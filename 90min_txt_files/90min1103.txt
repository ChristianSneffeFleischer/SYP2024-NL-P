Nottingham Forest are keen to keep hold of loan stars Keylor Navas and Renan Lodi for next season, 90min understands.  Costa Rican goalkeeper  Navas was out-of-favour at Paris Saint-Germain but became a Forest hero with his outstanding displays since joining on loan in January, playing a huge part in their Premier League survival.  Navas came to the club following fellow loanee Dean Henderson suffered a season-ending injury in mid-January - tearing his thigh muscle in a win over Leicester City.  However, despite Forest wanting Navas to stay, 90min has been told that he has clubs interested in his services from all over the world as he enters the final year of a three-year deal at PSG. Atletico Madrid are among those linked, but there is interest from all over Europe, the Middle East, MLS and South America thanks in large part of his exceptional showings at Forest.  Despite interest from across the world, Forest are confident that they can persuade Navas to return to the City Ground on a longer term deal.  feed
