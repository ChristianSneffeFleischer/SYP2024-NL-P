Barcelona are keeping tabs on Tottenham defender Davinson Sanchez as they look to bolster their defensive options this summer. Newly-appointed president Joan Laporta is keen to rebuild the Bar  a squad after the club were forced to embark on a fire sale last summer in a bid to trim their eye-watering wage bill. The La Liga giants have already been linked with a whole host of household names including Erling Haaland and Sergio Aguero, however, Laporta is keen to address their threadbare backline and Mundo Deportivo report that Tottenham defender Sanchez has been identified as a possible target.  The Colombian's time at Spurs has been marred by individual errors since his  Â£42m move from Ajax in 2017.  Having forced his way into the side despite the presence of Belgian duo Toby Alderweireld and Jan Vertonghen, he's failed to really cement his place in the starting XI - largely due to a number of comical individual errors from the Colombian.  The report adds that the Portuguese tactician has no desire to retain Sanchez's services this summer and is looking to cash in on the centre-back who's contracted to the club until 2024. There's no mention of what sort of fee Spurs would be likely to command for the Colombia international - something which will no doubt prove to be key in any potential deal considering Barcelona's current financial woes.
