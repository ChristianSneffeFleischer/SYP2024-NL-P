The San Jose Earthquakes have completed the signing of Brazilian center-back Rodrigues on loan from Gremio. Rodrigues moves to PayPal Park on a 12-month loan, with the Quakes holding the option to either extend his stay through the 2023 MLS season or make the transfer permanent. The 24-year-old will occupy an international roster slot.    We   re excited about the opportunity to bring in a player of his age and quality,    Earthquakes general manager Chris Leitch said in a club press release.    Rodrigues has competed for one of the most historic clubs in Brazil and appeared in many of South America   s best international competitions. We   re looking forward to him joining our locker room.    San Jose completed the move for Rodrigues prior to the closing of the MLS secondary transfer window on Thursday. The defender started his career with ABC Futebol Clube before joining Gremio in January 2019. Rodrigues has played 51 league matches for Imortal Tricolor so far, including 44 in the Brazilian top-flight, and is the second player to join MLS from Gremio this week after striker Elias Manoel signed for the New York Red Bulls. The signing of Rodrigues adds vital depth at center-back for the Quakes following the departure of Francisco Calvo to Turkish Super Lig side Konyaspor. Rodrigues will battle for minutes alongside compatriot Nathan and Tanner Beason.
