Ryan Bertrand has put pen to paper on a deal with Leicester City after the expiration of his contract with Southampton. The left-back revealed he would be leaving the Saints earlier this summer after seven years with the south coast club. Bertrand made over 200 Premier League appearances for Southampton having initially joined on loan from Chelsea in July 2014 before making the move to St. Mary's permanent the following year.  The 31-year-od came within 90 minutes of helping the Saints to their first domestic cup triumph this century in the 2017 EFL Cup final, though Zlatan Ibrahimovic's late strike secured a dramatic 3-2 win for Manchester United in the closing stages. Having said his goodbyes to the south coast club, 90min can now reveal Bertrand has signed a deal at Leicester that will see him link up with Brendan Rodgers once again after the pair worked together at Chelsea. Bertrand joins the Foxes on a free transfer after turning down advances from a host of clubs in favour of a move to the King Power Stadium. Leicester weren't the only Premier League outfit to express an interest in Bertrand, while he also had offers from Germany, Spain and Italy. Rodgers already has a host of options at left-back with Luke Thomas, James Justin and Timothy Castagne all capable of playing on the left-hand side of defence, but the latter's nasty injury sustained at Euro 2020 while representing Belgium has seen the Leicester boss keen to bolster his options further.
