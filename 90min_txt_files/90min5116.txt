Memphis Depay has refused to commit his future to Lyon with his contract set to expire at the end of the season.  Depay was Barcelona's number one target in the summer with the Blaugrana attempting to free up the funds for a transfer right up until transfer deadline day. In the end, no agreement could be reached, forcing him to stay put at Lyon.  Depay has made a solid start to the season, registering 10 goal involvements in 14 games and helping Les Gones to second in the Ligue 1 table.  However, Rudi Garcia is likely to be without his talisman and captain next season as his contract is set to expire in June.  "To be honest, we have a great team here. I don't know what will happen next year. I'm an OL player, the captain, and I'm here to win things, games and be  important for the team. This is my main goal," he said (via Goal). "If I start thinking about my future, I might lose my focus. I am 100 per cent  with OL. What will happen in the future, we'll see.  That's what I've always said. "I can't say anything about [Barcelona]. I'm here now, a lot of clubs might be interested."
