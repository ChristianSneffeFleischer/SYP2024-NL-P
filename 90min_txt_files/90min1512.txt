Barcelona president Joan Laporta is increasingly confident of persuading Lionel Messi to re-join the club, 90min understands. Laporta recently met with Messi's father, Jorge, and the pair discussed what a future for the Argentine forward would look like at Camp Nou if he chose to leave Paris Saint-Germain at the end of the season. Messi's future is in his hands as he approaches the end of his PSG contract. He has the option to extend that by a further 12 months or even renew with the Ligue 1 side, or he can walk away and join a new club. Major League Soccer side Inter Miami are also keen to convince Messi to leave PSG but sources have confirmed to 90min that the 35-year-old has concerns over his chances of competing for future Ballon d'Or trophies if he leaves Europe. Barcelona are working to convince Messi to return to Camp Nou, which includes rebuilding their relationship with his family after his departure from the club saw frustrations build, and sources have confirmed that both parties are prepared to put aside their differences if Messi himself wants to make the move. Messi's international future and desire to play in the 2024 Copa America is also part of his thinking, and has contributed to his decision to keep considering his options.
