Juventus have confirmed they have reached an agreement to terminate striker Gonzalo Higuain's contract. It was reported earlier in the summer that La Vecchia Signora wanted to part ways with the former Napoli forward following the appointment of Andrea Pirlo as Maurizio Sarri's successor. Higuain is expected to move to Major League Soccer side Inter Miami, who are owned by Manchester United and England legend David Beckham. GRAZIE di tutto e in bocca al lupo, Pipita!        https://t.co/58UuE3FZKV A statement on Juventus' website reads: "There were many battles together, many goals scored, with many often decisive. Now the paths of Gonzalo Higuain and Juventus go their separate ways: Pipita, after winning his third Scudetto, has officially taken off his Black and White shirt. "In the cavalcade that made us #Stron9er, precious goals remain in mind: the one against Inter at San Siro, for example, or the brace scored against Atalanta in Bergamo. The last of his 66 goals for Bianconeri, however, was scored where he scored for the first time in the Juventus jersey: at home, at the Allianz Stadium, thus closing the circle that began four years ago. "Now it's time to say goodbye: thanks for everything, Pipa! And good luck for your future." Higuain joined Juve in 2016 off the back of an incredible spell at Napoli and helped the club win three Serie A titles, though the arrival of Cristiano Ronaldo played a part in the Argentinean spending two unsuccessful loan spells at Milan and Chelsea during the 2018/19 season. He was a first team regular when Sarri took over from Massimiliano Allegri in 2019 and scored eight Serie A goals in 32 appearances that season.
