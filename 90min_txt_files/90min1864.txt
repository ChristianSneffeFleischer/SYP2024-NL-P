Brighton are planning moves to keep two of their stars who have recently caught the eye of England manager Gareth Southgate. The Seagulls have been flying in recent weeks under Roberto De Zerbi, winning 5-1 at Middlesbrough in the FA Cup before trouncing Liverpool 3-0 at the AMEX on Saturday. They're up to seventh in the Premier League, firmly among the teams chasing qualification for European competitions. Solly March netted twice against the Reds and his recent fine form has him in line for a new contract. 90min understands Albion are planning to open talks with March - who has 18 months left on his current deal - as they look to ward off interest from rival Premier League sides. Newcastle manager Eddie Howe and football director Dan Ashworth are both keen on the 28-year-old, who has contributed four goals and three assists in his last five games. His goals against Liverpool gave him his first ever top flight brace, while he also assisted Danny Welbeck's late strike. The Seagulls are also planning the next steps for loanee Levi Colwill at the club.
