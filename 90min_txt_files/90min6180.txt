Barcelona are keen to part ways with Martin Braithwaite in the summer, just six months on from his controversial transfer to the Camp Nou. The Catalan giants purchased the former Middlesbrough striker on an emergency transfer from Leganes in February, taking advantage of a La Liga loophole that enables clubs to make signings outside of the transfer window if they have a player ruled out with injury for over five months. With Ousmane Dembele's lengthy stint on the sidelines, Barcelona activated Braithwaite's    18m buyout clause, but Leganes were unable to sign a replacement and were ultimately relegated on the final day. However, his stay in Catalunya is not set to be a long one. According to Spanish news outlet Mundo Deportivo, Braithwaite is not in Barcelona's plans for next season, and they plan to offload him in the summer. The forward still has four years remaining on his deal at Camp Nou, but the club are plotting to loan him out or sell him permanently - with Barcelona demanding close to the    18m they paid Leganes for the Dane in February. The 29-year-old has sensed that he is surplus to requirements at Bar  a for some time and his agent, Ali Dursun, has already begun seeking out a new club. Real Sociedad, Mallorca, Sevilla and Osasuna have all been sounded out over a potential deal. Braithwaite scored once in 11 league appearances for Barcelona, as the club blew their lead at the summit of La Liga and lost out on the title to rivals Real Madrid by five points.
