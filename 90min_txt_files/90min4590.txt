Real Madrid are interested in signing young Manchester City striker Liam Delap, as they look to refresh their ageing squad. The 18-year-old has seriously impressed for City's development team this season, scoring 15 Premier League 2 goals in 20 games, as well as providing four assists. He has also made one senior appearance, netting on his debut against Bournemouth in the Carabao Cup back in September.  Be honest, you're hoping the long-throw gene was passed down to Liam Delap. ? pic.twitter.com/oWR5pr3p89 Pep Guardiola is understood to rate Delap highly, calling him up to train with the first team for the majority of the campaign. However, City may have a fight on their hands to keep the youngster at the club.  According to the Daily Star, Real have been impressed with his form and are weighing up a potential summer bid. The striker remains under contract at City until 2023 and the club will be keen to tie him down to a longer-term deal to fend off those interested in signing him.  Delap is the son of long throw specialist Rory, who wreaked havoc with his not-so-secret weapon while playing for Tony Pulis' Stoke City in the late 2000s. Liam started his youth career at Derby County, before signing for City in 2019 where he has been prolific ever since. Thanks to his intriguing blend of stature and technique, some generous onlookers have compared him with Erling Haaland.
