Lille midfielder Renato Sanches has revealed that an injury prevented him from signing for Barcelona last summer. The Portugal international has turned his career around in France, playing a pivotal role as Lille pipped Paris Saint-Germain to the Ligue 1 title last season. Sanches has been attracting Europe's biggest names again - he's recently discussed potential moves to Arsenal and AC Milan - and in an interview with L'Equipe revealed that he was supposed to join Barcelona in the 2021 summer transfer window. But a hamstring injury that required surgery to fix meant he had to stay put.    Many clubs were interested this summer, when I sustained the injury, I understood that I would have stayed at Lille," he said.    It was all done with Barcelona, I think it all collapsed because of the injury.    Sanches opened up on his move to Bayern Munich at the age of 19. He admitted was not ready for such a big step in his career, but would now be better prepared for the pressures of playing for an elite club.    When I arrived at Bayern Munich, I was not ready to play in such a club,    he added.    I was very young. And when I got ready, the opportunity to play with this team never came.
