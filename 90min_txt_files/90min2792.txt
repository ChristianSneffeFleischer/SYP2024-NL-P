PSG manager Christophe Galtier has confirmed that the club plan to sign a new forward before the transfer window closes as Mauro Icardi and Arnaud Kalimuendo near moves away from the capital. Kalimuendo has snubbed a move to Leeds in favour of remaining in Ligue 1 with Rennes, while Icardi has been demoted to the reserves in anticipation of an eventual departure from Parc des Princes in the coming weeks. Should both players leave, Galtier would have just two natural strikers on the books in the form of Kylian Mbappe and Reims loanee Hugo Ekitike, and the boss has acknowledged a new signing will be needed. "We want to sign a new forward," Galtier said. "With a busy schedule, we want arrivals. "The club is working, I am in direct contact with Luis Campos. Luis is in direct contact with our president. Make no mistake about it. Will the player arrive? We don't know that."
