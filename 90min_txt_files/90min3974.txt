Manchester United are prepared to let young winger Amad Diallo leave the club on loan this summer. Lured over from Atalanta in a deal worth up to  Â£37m in January, Amad split his time between United's senior and reserve sides and ended his debut campaign with one goal and one assist from eight appearances for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's first team.

United know a season of reserve football would be pointless for Amad - a return of four goals and three assists in just three outings for the Under-23s suggests he may be above that level already - and those in charge at Old Trafford want to see how he handles a full season of senior football. There are no mentions of where Amad will end up, but there will likely be no shortage of offers for a player widely seen as one of the most exciting teenagers on the planet. There had been doubts over whether Solskjaer would agree to let Amad go following the news that Marcus Rashford is set to miss the next few months while he recovers from shoulder surgery, but it appears as though the boss has the bigger picture in mind here. Instead, Amad is set for a loan move like fellow young winger Facundo Pellistri, who will spend the upcoming season with Alaves.
