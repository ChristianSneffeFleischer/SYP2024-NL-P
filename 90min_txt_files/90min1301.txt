AC Milan director Frederic Massara has provided an update on the future of Rafael Leao, stating he wants a decision on the striker's future by the end of the season. Leao's current contract with the club runs until 2024, but recent speculation surrounding his future has raised questions about whether he will stay at Milan. 90min revealed earlier this year there was 'growing optimism' a new deal would be agreed amid interest from Chelsea. Massara has now responded to reports that contract negotiations have broken down, denying this is the case and saying the club is keen to secure Leao's future. "There is a mutual willingness to renew and it is a good foundation. There are particular complexities, but we are facing them with confidence in the hope of finding a solution by the end of the season," he told Sky Italia. While negotiations are ongoing, Massara stated there are still some hurdles to overcome. He added: "Making percentages is a bit difficult; either we do it or we don't, it's always 50-50. There have been times when we seemed closer, others a little further away. It is a solution that we want to solve. It is clear that by the end of the season we have to figure out whether there will be a possibility to extend." feed Leao was a crucial part of the Milan side that won the 2021/22 Serie A title, contributing 11 goals and eight assists. He's posted similar numbers this year but his side are way off the pace set but champions-elect Napoli.  The Rossoneri are currently third in Serie A and securing Leao's future would be a boost for the club as they look to challenge for the title in the coming seasons.
