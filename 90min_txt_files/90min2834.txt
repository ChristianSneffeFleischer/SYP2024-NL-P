Timo Werner has agreed to slash his wages in order to force through a permanent exit from Chelsea this summer, 90min understands. A return to RB Leipzig is on the cards, with the Bundesliga outfit agreeing to take Werner back on a permanent basis just two years after his  £47.5m move to Stamford Bridge. Sources have confirmed to 90min that Chelsea will recover just north of  £25m (   30m) by selling Werner, who will depart London with a disappointing haul of 23 goals and 21 assists in 89 appearances in all competitions. Werner is currently one of the top earners at Chelsea but his public desire to play regular minutes in the build-up to the World Cup later this year, which yielded a frustrated response from manager Thomas Tuchel, has seen him agree to a substantial pay cut. He is now set to return to Germany to undergo a medical and put pen to paper to rejoin the side with whom he racked up 34 goals and 13 assists in just 45 games in his final season.
