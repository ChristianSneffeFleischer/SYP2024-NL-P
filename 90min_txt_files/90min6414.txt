Manchester United midfielder Nemanja Matic is reported to have signed a new long-term contract which will keep him at the club until 2023.  The big Serbian has been an important part of the Red Devils' post-lockdown revival, and has started each of their last three league matches - helping his team to the points which have catapulted them right back into Champions League contention. Having been signed by Jos   Mourinho in 2017 for around  Â£40m, Matic's contract was due to run out in 2021. However, Sky Sports' Gianluca Di Marzio reports that he has now extended his stay by a further two years.  #Matic signed a new contract with @ManUtd till 2023 @NemanjaMatic @SkySport @SkySports The new deal will keep the midfielder at the club up to close to his 35th birthday, and cements his status as one of the building blocks of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's revolution.  In March, the club triggered an extension that would prevent him leaving for free this summer, and it was later reported that the two parties were in talks over an extension, but that all went quiet during the lockdown.   It appears as though the player's form alongside the more creative duo of Paul Pogba and Bruno Fernandes has convinced the club hierarchy of his longer-term worth. Speaking earlier in the week, Matic spoke of his confidence in his in-form side to secure a top four spot. He said, via Goal: "We don   t depend only on us, we have to win our games and wait for others to drop points and I hope we can reach that third spot and, if we do that, then the season will be fantastic for us. I   m very, very confident and I think the team looks well at the moment.
