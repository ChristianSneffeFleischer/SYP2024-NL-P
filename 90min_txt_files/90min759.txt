Arsenal have held talks with Southampton over midfielder Romeo Lavia, 90min understands. The Gunners remain locked in negotiations with West Ham over first-choice target Declan Rice, for whom a  £90m bid was recently rejected, but there are plans to add at least one other midfielder as well. Moises Caicedo is strongly admired by Arsenal but Brighton's near  £100m asking price has seen the club look in another direction, namely towards Belgian teenager Lavia. Sources have confirmed to 90min that talks have been held over a move for the 19-year-old, who was a stand-out performer for Southampton last season and has no shortage of teams keen to offer him the chance to remain in the Premier League. Indeed, Chelsea are long-time admirers of Lavia through Blues director Joe Shields, who recruited Lavia during his time at Manchester City and also played a role in the midfielder's move to Southampton last summer. Shields has ensured that Chelsea remain informed on Lavia, but as it stands, the Blues are prioritising other targets and are pushing to strike a deal for Caicedo. feed Liverpool, Manchester United and Newcastle are all interested in recruiting Lavia but, like Chelsea, have other priorities at this moment. However, the mounting interest in Lavia's services could spark some of his suitors into life. Southampton accept that they are set to lose Lavia but are prepared to wait until they receive the right offer for his services. The Saints had been asking for  £50m before their relegation from the Premier League but are now expected to accept slightly less. As part of his sale to Southampton, Manchester City also secured a buy-back clause for Lavia worth around  £40m, but that clause is only valid for the summer of 2024 and would be wiped out if the midfielder moves clubs this year.
