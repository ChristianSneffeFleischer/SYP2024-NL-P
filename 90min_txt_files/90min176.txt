Rasmus Hojlund will travel to Manchester on Tuesday for a medical ahead of sealing his move to Manchester United, 90min understands. After lengthy negotiations with Atalanta, United have agreed to a deal which will see them part with a guaranteed    75m ( £64m, $82.3m), with a further    10m ( £8.6m, $11m) in potential add-ons, to sign the 20-year-old striker. With personal terms agreed earlier in July, all that is left is for Hojlund to pass his medical and sources have confirmed to 90min that the Dane is due in Manchester on Tuesday to undergo his checks. Should all go to plan, Hojlund will become United's third signing of the summer, following Mason Mount and Andre Onana in agreeing moves to Old Trafford. Denmark teammate Christian Eriksen recently gave fans an insight into what they can expect from Hojlund, telling PA: "What's he like? He's a strong number nine. He's developed a lot in the last year from when I first saw him with the national team [to] a year's time, so, yeah, he's a very good player." feed Eriksen continued: "I suppose we don't get enough media attention in Denmark that's why, so people outside Denmark don't know enough. "He's a nice guy, he's a good player. Like I said, he's developed, turning into just a nine, which he's played for the national team. "I have to be honest I haven't seen that many games for Atalanta, but I know how they play and he fitted in well there, so, yeah, he's a good player." United have endured a mixed bag on their pre-season tour of the United States, beating Arsenal 2-0 at SoFi Stadium but also losing to Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund. A youthful team also lost 3-1 to Wrexham, who were promoted to the Football League last season after pipping Notts County to top spot.
