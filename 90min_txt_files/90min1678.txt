Spanish winger Bryan Gil has rejoined Sevilla on loan from Tottenham Hotspur until the end of the season. The diminutive 21-year-old first signed for Spurs from Sevilla in the summer of 2021 for a    25m fee plus Erik Lamela. He failed to make an immediate impact under Nuno Espirito Santo and then Antonio Conte, returning to Spain for the second half of the 2021/22 season on a loan deal with Valencia. While he has impressed in short spells for Spurs this campaign, regular game time has been hard to come by, and his pathway to the starting lineup was recently further blocked by the loan arrival of Arnaut Danjuma. It was confirmed on Monday night that he will spend the rest of the 2022/23 season on loan with former side Sevilla. In a statement, Sevilla said: "Sevilla FC and Tottenham Hotspur FC have reached an agreement for the loan of Bryan Gil until the end of the season. The attacker returns to his former home to reinforce the attack for the second half of the season." Reports in Spain recently claimed that Spurs' initial reluctance to let Gil leave was angering and saddening the player, but they then agreed to green-light an exit.
