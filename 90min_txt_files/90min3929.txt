Tottenham head coach Nuno Espirito Santo is keen for the club to secure the signing of Adama Traore from former club Wolves, urging managing director of football Fabio Paratici to complete a deal before the transfer deadline. Spurs have been tentatively linked with the Spain international throughout the summer, but will step up their pursuit of the winger this week. 90min understands that Traore is pushing for the move to Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, and his former head coach Nuno is hopeful of a reunion in north London. Spurs' initial bid for Traore has been knocked back over the structuring of the deal - Tottenham intend to sign him on an initial loan but Wolves would prefer that loan comes with an obligation to buy. This is not seen as a major stumbling block and is expected to be resolved. Wolves have been open to selling Traore this window. Liverpool were exploring a deal for the winger, but were put off by the  £40m price tag. Leeds United were also interested but would not commit to a deal over  £30m. Traore and Nuno had their issues last season over the winger's contract, but there has never been a problem between the two of them personally, hence their willingness to link up once again. Spurs beat Wolves 1-0 on Sunday on Nuno's return to Molineux, with Traore running the Tottenham defence ragged but squandering the home side's best chances.  Chairman Daniel Levy was in attendance, as were Paratici and technical performance director Steve Hitchen. Dele Alli grabbed the game's only goal from the penalty spot after he was fouled by Wolves goalkeeper Jose Sa early on.
