Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag has played down the significance of PSV Eindhoven counterpart Ruud van Nistelrooy suggesting it is possible Cody Gakpo could leave in January. Gakpo was heavily linked with a departure from PSV during the summer amid plenty of interest from the Premier League, notably from Old Trafford. 90min understands that PSV are now expecting to lose Gakpo in the upcoming January transfer window. United lead the chase for the 23-year-old, although the Dutch side are still willing to talk to all interested parties about a potential deal. In Summer, United ultimately opted to spend their money on Ajax winger Antony, but following a stellar World Cup with Netherlands, combined with Cristiano Ronaldo's sudden departure, talk of a move for Gakpo is hotting up once more. Van Nistelrooy admitted he can see a world where Gakpo leaves the club in January. "If I have the choice, I prefer [Gakpo to leave in] the summer, but it can also be now. You just know there comes a time when you can't say no," the former United star said. However, Ten Hag has since played it down, addressing the comments in a press conference ahead of the return of Premier League football next week.
