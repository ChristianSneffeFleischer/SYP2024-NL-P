Dubravka's agent, Daniel Zik, has confirmed the 33-year-old is unhappy to have lost his starting spot at St James' Park and is looking for the opportunity to play regular first-team football - something which may be unlikely in Manchester. David De Gea remains United's starting goalkeeper, despite a rocky start to the current season, although the Red Devils' plan has always been to have a high-level backup to provide serious competition for the Spaniard.
