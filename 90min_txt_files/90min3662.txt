Antonio Conte has again stressed the need for Tottenham to dip into the January transfer market, while he also provided an update on contract talks with club captain Hugo Lloris. Conte's Spurs needed a stoppage-time header from Davinson Sanchez in order to beat lowly Watford on New Year's Day, just about avoiding a second draw in two games against bottom half sides. The Spurs boss has long preached the need for the club to help him improve the team, while he also said that his assessment of the current squad has left him 'clear' on which areas he wants strengthened. "We need to talk about new signings, yes. When I was appointed, I was told that we would meet to talk about new signings. Now I have everything clear [about the current team]," Conte told Sky Sport Italia. He was also asked about the future of France skipper Lloris, who is now free to talk to foreign clubs now that he's in the final six months of his current contract. But the Italian tactician was hopeful that Lloris and Spurs will come to an agreement in the near future, and spoke of his goalkeeper's importance in the win at Watford. "Yeah for sure, but you can see the level of the keeper in these circumstances," Conte said in a press conference when asked if Lloris' commitment to the club was evident in his display. "When for the whole game he didn't make a save but he continued to be focused. To be focused for the team, for me that's very important. "When I speak with him and when I speak to the team, the link between the keeper and the team must be very important. It's very important especially when you defend very high, with a defensive line.
