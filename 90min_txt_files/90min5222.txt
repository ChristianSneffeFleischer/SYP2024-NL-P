Rennes sensation Eduardo Camavinga is said to be close to extending his current deal at the club by another year. The all-action midfielder has attracted the attention of Europe's elite after bursting onto the scene at 16 midway through the 2018/19 campaign, before he gained greater recognition following a magical display against Paris Saint-Germain at the start of last season. The 18-year-old has since evolved into a France international - becoming the youngest scorer for Les Bleus in over a century - and has been linked with a monster move to Real Madrid.  However, it seems that his exit from Rennes may be delayed as he appears happy to sign an extension with the French club.  L'Equipe reports that Camavinga is 'on track' to extend his current deal, which he signed in August 2019 and runs until 2022, by a further year. The French outlet claims that talks are well advanced and a positive conclusion appears to be imminent.

"It's not something that comes into my head, that I think about constantly," Camavinga told reporters on Wednesday (via Goal). "I see and I hear [the talk]. These are things that give me pleasure. I'm at Rennes and other clubs, that's not for now. We'll see. "I have two years left on my contract and we'll have time to talk. There will be talks. To prolong my stay at the club that formed me would make me happy," the young Frenchman added. "Obviously, the big clubs are a dream. After that I could not name one in particular."
