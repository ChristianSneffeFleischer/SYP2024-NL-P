Southampton are in talks with Rangers over a potential move for versatile midfielder Joe Aribo, 90min understands. The 25-year-old has been a key figure for the Gers since arriving from Charlton in a free transfer in 2019, helping them to a Scottish Premiership title in 2020/21 season and featuring in every match in the scintillating run to the Europa League final last term. Aribo only has one year left to run on his contract and sources have told 90min he recently rejected fresh terms to extend his stay at Ibrox. As a result, Rangers have decided to sell. Southampton are currently leading the pursuit for his signature, although they will face competition from a number of their Premier League rivals. 90min understands newly-promoted pair Fulham and Nottingham Forest have expressed an interest in the midfielder, as well as Crystal Palace. As it stands, Aston Villa - currently managed by title-winning former Rangers boss Steven Gerrard - are not among his suitors.
