Tottenham Hotspur's search for a new centre-back could lead them to Eintracht Frankfurt defender Evan Ndicka, 90min understands. Spurs will look to add a new defender to their ranks this summer, with Cristian Romero's arrival on a loan with an obligatory purchase clause in 2021 their last permanent addition in that area. Sources have told 90min that Ndicka - who faced Tottenham twice in the group stage of this season's Champions League, keeping one clean sheet - is a target for them this summer. The 23-year-old is due to be out of contract at the end of June so is available on a free transfer, while he is also left-footed - two factors which would appeal hugely to Spurs. 90min revealed earlier on Wednesday that representatives from Tottenham were at Deutsche Bank Park to watch Frankfurt's 2-0 defeat at the hands of Napoli in the first leg of their Champions League last 16 tie. Ndicka and teammate Daichi Kamada were likely the two players followed closest by Spurs.
