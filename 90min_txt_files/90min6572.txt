Leicester and Crystal Palace are both eyeing a summer move for Burnley defender James Tarkowski, after an impressive 2019/20 campaign at Turf Moor. The England international has become an integral part of the Clarets' defence alongside Ben Mee, forming a solid defensive partnership with the former Manchester City trainee. The 27-year-old has made just two appearances for England so far, but is widely recognised as one of the Premier League's most commanding central defenders. Now, according to the Mirror, Leicester and Crystal Palace are prepared to go head-to-head this summer in a bid to prize him away from Lancashire. Foxes manager Brendan Rodgers has been on the lookout for a new central defender after sanctioning the  £80m sale of Harry Maguire last summer to Manchester United. Jonny Evans and   a  lar S  y  nc   have been excellent in the heart of Leicester's defence since he left, but the possible departure of Wes Morgan has left Rodgers in desperate need of reinforcement - particularly with Champions League football on the horizon next season. As for Palace, the continued absence of Mamadou Sakho, as well as the advancing years of both Gary Cahill and Scott Dann, has opened the door for a new potential signing. Roy Hodgson's side have enjoyed a relatively positive season so far, with the Eagles currently in 11th place, just six points behind Manchester United in fifth. However, the club have been crying out for a new centre-back option, with Tarkowski high in their list of priorities. Burnley have previously slapped a  £50m price tag on Tarkowski's head in order to ward off potential interest, though they are unlikely to be able to command such a figure owing to the financial impact caused by coronavirus.  ???????
