Manchester United defender Timothy Fosu-Mensah is on the verge of signing a three-year deal with Bundesliga outfit Bayer Leverkusen. The Dutchman has been deemed surplus to requirements at Old Trafford, with Old Gunnar Solskjaer recently confirming he wouldn't stand in the defender's way if he wished to leave the club in January. Eredivisie champions Ajax were rumoured to be interested in securing the services of the player who spent eight years with their youth academy prior to signing for United in 2014, however, Sky Sports now claim that the 23-year-old has agreed a deal with Bayer Leverkusen. In a move believed to be worth  Â£1.8m, Fosu-Mensah will sign a three-year contract with the German club which will see him through to 2024. The Netherlands international has spent six seasons in and around the first team at Old Trafford but has never managed to cement his place in the starting XI. Since 2014, the 23-year-old has mustered just 16 Premier League appearances for United and 14 appearances in other competitions. Fosu-Mensah has twice been shipped out on loan in search of regular first-team football since his move to the Red Devils in 2014. The youngster enjoyed a relatively successful year with Crystal Palace in 2017/18, making 21 Premier League appearances for the club including 17 starts.
