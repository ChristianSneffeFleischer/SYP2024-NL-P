Manchester United have been linked with a move for Arsenal utility player Ainsley Maitland-Niles, who can play all across midfield and as a full-back. The sudden peculation originally emerged in Germany as the Jadon Sancho saga rumbles on. Maitland-Niles was key to Arsenal   s FA Cup success at the end of last season and has started four of the club   s five games in all competitions so far in 2020/21. On paper, he could be a valuable addition to a United squad that lacks depth, particularly at full-back, and a tweet from a SPORT1 reporter in Germany claimed that a deal worth  £20m plus add-ons is 80% complete. But the speculation has been quickly debunked. The Manchester Evening News reports that United sources have denied there is any truth to the Maitland-Niles story. The club   s priority targets in the final few days of the transfer window remain Porto left-back Alex Telles and the aforementioned Sancho. United are thought to be targeting up to three deals before the deadline on 5 October, which could include a short-term striker boost. Talks are reported to be ongoing over a possible contract for free agent Edinson Cavani or a loan for Real Madrid fringe forward Luka Jovic. United are not interested in Maitland-Niles and, what   s more, Arsenal want to keep him, despite previously being open to letting the home-grown player go. Maitland-Niles had been speculatively linked with Tottenham but was a serious target for Wolves, were close to agreeing a  £20m transfer, only for Arsenal to back away late in proceedings.
