Barcelona manager Xavi has confirmed that the club have reached a compromise with Atletico Madrid over the permanent transfer of Antoine Griezmann. Griezmann joined Atletico on a loan deal last year which included a    40m obligation to buy if he played a certain percentage of minutes - something Los Rojiblancos have been trying to avoid by keeping the Frenchman on the bench. Keen to ensure the deal did not collapse, Barcelona agreed to negotiate the terms of the deal with Atletico and sources have confirmed to 90min that the Madrid side have now agreed to a future transfer worth around the    20m mark. Asked about the agreement during a press conference on Saturday, Xavi responded: "The club tells me that they have reached an agreement, but it is not official. If there is an agreement, it means that all parties are happy.  "I wish the player the best." Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  and  Toby Cudworth  bring you a brand new episode of Talking Transfers.
