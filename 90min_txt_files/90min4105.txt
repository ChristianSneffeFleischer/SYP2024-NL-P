Robert Lewandowski will not leave Bayern Munich this summer, despite interest from Chelsea and Manchester City.   Lewandowksi is the best striker in the world, netting over 100 goals in all competitions over the past two seasons. This included a record breaking 2020/21 campaign where he managed 41 goals in the Bundesliga, breaking Gerd Muller   s long-standing scoring record in the process. He still has two years left to run of his current deal but that has not stopped him being linked with a move to the Premier League. However, as reported by L   Equipe (via Get French Football News), Die Roten are eager for him to stick around - even if a big offer comes in.   His agent Pini Zahavi is said to be more open to a move as he is convinced Lewandowski wants one more challenge before he retires. Real Madrid would be the club most likely to tempt the Pole away from Bavaria but due to their current financial predicament, a move would be impossible during the current window.   That is not to say that Los Blancos would not be tempted into approaching Lewandowski next summer, although Bayern are eager to extend his contract. If they cannot agree a new deal they would still demand around    50m for their talisman - big money for a player of his advanced age.
