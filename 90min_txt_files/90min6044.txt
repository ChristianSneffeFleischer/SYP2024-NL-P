Manchester United youngster Tahith Chong has flown out to complete his medical ahead of a loan move to Werder Bremen, but the deal is being held up after 'new problems' arose regarding the finances of the deal.  Chong penned a new two-year contract extension back in March with the option of a third year to end talk of a move away on a free transfer, with his previous deal due to expire this summer.  The 20-year-old is very highly rated at United, but he has struggled for consistent game time in the first team this season. Indeed, Chong managed just 34 minutes of Premier League football in 2019/20, although he has featured more regularly in the Europa League.

Following this, Bremen's sporting director was forced to concede that the German club are indeed in 'good talks' with the Red Devils regarding a loan move.  The two clubs were yet to agree the length of the loan, however, while they have also struggled to see eye to eye on the finances of the deal as well. Nonetheless, an agreement was said to be very close. Bild now report, however, that the deal is being held up as the finances are continuing to prove to be an issue.
