Jurgen Klopp has confirmed he does not expect Liverpool to part ways with midfielder Thiago Alcantara this summer. Thiago is the latest Liverpool midfielder to attract interest from Saudi Arabia, with reports suggesting a reunion with Roberto Firmino at Al Ahli could be on the cards. Liverpool have already sold both Jordan Henderson and Fabinho to Saudi Arabia, while James Milner, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Naby Keita have departed on free transfers, leaving Klopp's side a little light in midfield. As a result, there are no plans to offload Thiago, who is back in training after recovery from a hip injury. "He   s now training, he came in and asked about his role and we spoke," Klopp told his pre-match press conference before Liverpool's opening Premier League game of the new season. "[He   s a] super experienced player, he stepped up in that department. He has only been in team training for a week but very vocal, he is going to be very helpful for us." feed Liverpool continue to search for midfield reinforcements and have been in talks over both Brighton's Moises Caicedo and Southampton's Romeo Lavia. A British record deal of  £111m was agreed for the former but interest from Chelsea has proven to be a real problem. The Blues had been chasing Caicedo all summer and the Ecuador international is understood to be prioritising a move to Stamford Bridge as a result. Meanwhile, Chelsea are also closing in on a deal for Lavia, for whom Liverpool had three bids rejected before igniting their pursuit of Caicedo. Liverpool's third offer for Lavia stood at  £46m - short of Southampton's  £50m asking price - but Chelsea are pursuing an agreement which would be worth  £55m. Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai have already arrived at Anfield, adding significant creative ability to Liverpool's ranks.
