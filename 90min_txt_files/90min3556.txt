Pictures have emerged on social media of Luis Diaz wearing a Liverpool training kit ahead of his official unveiling. The Colombian has agreed a five-year contract with the Reds and, barring any late hiccups, will complete a    60m move before Monday's transfer deadline. The 25-year-old has been in electrifying form for Porto this season, scoring 14 times in 18 league games as well as notching twice in six Champions League outings. Diaz, who cost Porto just    7m in 2019, is also an experienced and established international, and was joint-top scorer at last summer's Copa America. 90min understands Liverpool have agreed to meet Porto's demands of a    60m total package, which will include    45m in solid payments plus    15m in performance related add-ons.

The Reds already possess one of the fiercest frontlines in Europe, led by Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane and Diogo Jota. Jurgen Klopp also has Roberto Firmino at his disposal, illustrating the incredible wealth of talent and options at his disposal. Diaz will likely provide competition for Mane on the left flank, having featured for Porto there throughout the season, and his arrival could spell the end of Takumi Minamino's Liverpool career.
