Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag has refused to guarantee that Cristiano Ronaldo will remain at the club beyond the end of the summer transfer window. Ronaldo has asked to leave Old Trafford this summer in search of Champions League football and has largely operated as a substitute under Ten Hag, coming off the bench for the third time this season in Saturday's 1-0 win over Southampton. After the game, Ten Hag was asked whether Ronaldo would still be a United player next month, and the boss admitted he could not guarantee anything.    I cannot say that [Ronaldo will definitely stay]," Ten Hag told BT Sport. "We plan with him and we stick to the plan.    If a good player is available, we will strike because we want to strengthen the squad. We will be alert until the last second of the window.
