Bayern Munich have sensationally been knocked back by Chelsea after lodging a huge bid of more than  £70m for Callum Hudson-Odoi. The Bavarian giants have long-held a deep interest in signing the 19-year-old, and he attempted to force through a move to Munich in January 2019 after handing in a transfer request at Stamford Bridge. But a deal looked to be dead in the water after Hudson-Odoi performed a U-turn after Frank Lampard took over as head coach, and he signed a new bumper five-year deal last summer to commit his future to the club until at least 2024. Rumours of Bayern's interest have begun to resurface in recent weeks though, and MailOnline Sport now report that Chelsea have turned down an offer to take Hudson-Odoi on loan, which in turn would allow Bayern to have an option to buy in a deal worth more than  £70m. Lampard has been adamant of late that he wants Hudson-Odoi to stay put, and he confirmed after Chelsea's 4-0 win over Crystal Palace that his stance had not changed. That comes after 90min learned earlier this month that the club would be willing to loan him out this season, though he was not a regular fixture in the team at that time. Hudson-Odoi's recent recall to the side is the culmination of a difficult 18 months that has not only seen his future called into question, but the overcoming of a serious Achilles tendon injury. A starter for Chelsea's last couple of games, he has fiercer competition for places than ever before - despite the departures of Pedro and Willian over the past few months. Kai Havertz, Hakim Ziyech and Timo Werner have all arrived, while Christian Pulisic is one of the Premier League's hottest properties. He's only been on the sidelines of late because of an injury picked up in the FA Cup final against Arsenal in early August.
