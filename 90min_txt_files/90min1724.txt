Anthony Gordon has arrived on Tyneside to undergo a medical ahead of his transfer from Everton to Newcastle United, 90min understands. The 21-year-old forward missed three consecutive days of training earlier this week as he looked to push through a move to the Magpies, before finally returning to Everton's Finch Farm facility on Friday. Gordon attracted serious interest from the likes of Tottenham and Chelsea during the summer months but Everton managed to fight off those advances. The latter maintained an interest in the winger, who has seven goals to his name in 51 Premier League appearances over the last two seasons. However, it quickly became clear later in January that the main interest was coming from Newcastle. After days of negotiation, the two clubs finally came to an agreement that'll see Newcastle pay Everton an initial  £40m fee for Gordon, with a further  £5m due in add-ons, as reported by 90min.  Everton had previously placed a  £60m price tag on the player. With the two clubs now aligned, sources have confirmed to 90min that Gordon has arrived in the North East to undergo a medical exam before finalising his transfer to St. James' Park.
