Leeds United will make another move for Rangers winger Ryan Kent should they fail to land Manchester United's Daniel James before the transfer deadline. The Whites were on the cusp of signing James in January 2019 when he was at Swansea before a move fell through, and have made a loan offer to Manchester United in a second attempt to secure the Welshman's services. But it's unclear how likely a move for James would be as it stands, despite him falling down the pecking order at United. And while a move for James stalls, Kent, who was heavily linked with a move to Leeds earlier in the window, is again being explored as an option according to The Sun. Kent joined Rangers on loan from Liverpool in 2018 and made the move permanent a year later, linking up with former Reds captain and current Rangers head coach Steven Gerrard. The winger has made a fine start to the season in Scotland, bagging five goals and five assists from 10 games in all competitions. Leeds have also been linked with Norwich's Todd Cantwell, who stood out for Norwich in the top flight last season despite their relegation. But The Sun insist Kent will take priority.
