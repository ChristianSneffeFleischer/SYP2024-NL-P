Tottenham Hotspur have struck an agreement with Sporting CP for the transfer of Pedro Porro, 90min understands. Porro has long been Spurs' primary target to strengthen at right wing-back and they have spent much of this month in talks with Sporting over a deal. It seemed for much of last week that Porro would be heading to north London after Sporting played Porto in the League Cup final on Saturday, but news broke early on Monday morning that a deal was hanging in the balance with the clubs still to agree a fee. Porro, who has already agreed personal terms with Tottenham, was granted permission to miss Sporting training on Monday while the clubs worked to seek a resolution. And 90min understands that an agreement is now in place for Porro to join Spurs for a fee of around    48m paid in several instalments. Sporting will now also receive 65% of any future fee for Tottenham academy graduate Marcus Edwards, with Spurs retaining 35%. He is set to undergo a medical at Hotspur Way on deadline day and is set to sign for Tottenham prior to Tuesday's 11pm transfer deadline.
