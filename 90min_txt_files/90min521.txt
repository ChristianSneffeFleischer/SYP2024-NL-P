Paris Saint-Germain president Nasser Al-Khelaifi and new manager Luis Enrique responded to questions on Kylian Mbappe's future at the club during a press conference on Wednesday. Former Spain and Barcelona head coach Enrique has signed a two-year deal at Parc des Princes and replaces Christophe Galtier, whose own inevitable exit was confirmed earlier on the same day. Lionel Messi has already left PSG following the expiry of his contract and uncertainty also clouds the future of star man and France captain Mbappe. 90min revealed in June PSG do not want the elite forward to leave for nothing next summer after he confirmed his plan to depart after a final season. PSG now have to agree a new deal with the World Cup winner or face selling him this summer, with Real Madrid his known preferred destination. Enrique himself admitted he will not talk about Mbappe's future in public, but president Al-Khelaifi shed more light on the situation. Enrique said: "When I signed, we always remain open. A lot of things can happen. feed "I will keep it private as it's professional secrecy. I cannot give confidences but we will try to make the best possible squad for PSG." Al-Khelaifi added: "Our position is very clear. If Kylian Mbappe wants to stay, we want him to stay. But we can't let one of the best players in the world leave on a free. "Mbappe has said that he will not leave for free. If he changed his mind, it is not our fault." Mbappe has long courted a move to Real but the Spanish giants may not have the funds to pursue a move this summer given the hefty outlay used to sign Jude Bellingham from Borussia Dortmund.
