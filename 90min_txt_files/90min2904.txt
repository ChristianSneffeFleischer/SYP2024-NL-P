Chicago Fire goalkeeper Gabriel Slonina has agreed to join Chelsea and will sign a contract until 2028 before heading back to Major League Soccer. Slonina is one of MLS' most exciting talents, keeping ten clean sheets so far this season from 23 starts, and has been linked with some of Europe's top clubs. Real Madrid, Atletico Madrid and Bayern Munich have all shown an interest in the teenager, but Chelsea have put together a transfer package worth $15m including add-ons, making him the fifth largest outgoing transfer in MLS history. Slonina has earned rave reviews but is one for the future at Stamford Bridge, with Edouard Mendy the firm number one right now. He has earned two appearances for the United States Under-20s but is yet to feature for the senior outfit. The 18-year-old will be Chelsea's third major signing of the summer following deals for Raheem Sterling and Kalidou Koulibaly, but they are also targeting Spanish defender Marc Cucurella. Listen now to 90min's Talking Transfers podcast, with  Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey,  Harry Symeou  &  Toby Cudworth. On the latest show they discuss Cristiano Ronaldo holding talks with Man Utd over his future, Barcelona signing Jules Kounde ahead of Chelsea, Man City rewarding Phil Foden with a new contract and more.
