Liverpool have made official contact with Bayern Munich over the transfer of Thiago Alcantara, according to reports in Germany.  The 29-year-old has been linked with a move to Anfield for some time, after informing Die Roten that he wants to leave in the upcoming transfer window back in July.  Bild: Liverpool make official contact over Thiago. https://t.co/HbjzsYPPjC According to Bild, this protracted saga has taken a step forward with Liverpool contacting Bayern sporting director Hasan Salihamidzic to discuss the prospect of signing the creative midfielder. The German tabloid also claims that there is a 'fundamental agreement' between the Reds and Thiago over personal terms, and it is a disagreement over the transfer fee that is holding things up. The Bundesliga champions are holding out out for a fee between    30m and    40m. Whether Liverpool will cough up that much for a player with just one year remaining on his current deal remains to be seen.   Although Jurgen Klopp has admitted to being a fan of the midfielder, these reports should be taken with a fairly large pinch of salt. Although Bild are keen to assert that the deal is 100% happening, this has been met with scepticism by outlets in the United Kingdom.  Recently, Sky Sports reported that while Thiago is keen on the move, Liverpool do not have any plans to strengthen their midfield in the forthcoming window. The club instead want to extend Georginio Wijnaldum's deal, which currently expires in 2021 and there is no suggestion that any other midfielders will be departing Merseyside any time soon.
