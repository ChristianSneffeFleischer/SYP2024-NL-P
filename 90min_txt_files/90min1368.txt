Luka Modric has played down the chances of leaving Real Madrid to join a club in Saudi Arabia, insisting he would like to retire in the Spanish capital. The 37-year-old's contract expires in the summer and terms over a new deal have not yet been agreed with Los Blancos. With no agreement yet in place, Modric has been tipped to make a big-money move to the Saudi Pro League later this year, potentially reuniting with former teammate Cristiano Ronaldo. But Modric has insisted this is just speculation and he has no desire to leave Real Madrid just yet. READ NEXT manual When asked about a possible move to Saudi Arabia while on international duty with Croatia, Modric said: "I know the press always has to write news, but I said the same many times and I repeat that I want to stay at Real Madrid. "I'd love to retire at Real Madrid, that would be fantastic. We will see." Reports from across Europe have suggested Modric would only receive a new contract offer from Real Madrid if he were to retire from international football, but he dismissed this notion. "Short and clear, no [he doesn't need to retire]. I want to stay at Real Madrid, and I hope it will happen," Modric said. Though Modric remains an integral part of the Real Madrid squad, his game time has started to dwindle in recent seasons due to his age. Though he has made 37 appearances in all competitions for Los Blancos this term, Modric has completed the full 90 minutes on just five occasions. His seniority has been reflected with the captain's armband when Karim Benzema and Nacho Fernandez have not been available, skippering Real Madrid four times. Modric has scored four goals and laid on five assists this campaign, while also picking up six bookings.
