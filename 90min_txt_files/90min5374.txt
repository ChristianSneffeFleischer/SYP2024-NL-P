Leicester City midfielder Nampalys Mendy has admitted that he considered leaving the club prior to signing a new contract in August. Mendy has started all four of the Foxes' top flight fixtures this campaign, already playing more than the 291 minutes of Premier League football that he managed last term. Having hardly featured during the 2019/20 season and with his contract expiring at the end of the extended campaign, he was expected to move elsewhere during the transfer window. However, Mendy put pen to paper on a new two-year deal and has impressed in defensive midfield during Leicester's strong start to the 2020/21 season - but the midfielder admitted he was weighing up new clubs before the contract offer arrived.    Honestly, it was difficult because you have to think about changing clubs,    he told talkSPORT (via the Leicester Mercury).    This is normal. But when I had the opportunity to sign a new contract, I did it straight away, because I know the club and I know the players and I feel very well here. "This season, we have a lot of games in the Europa League and the Premier League, and it was a big opportunity for me to play more, and that   s why I signed a new contract.    Every season is different, but I   m still the same. I work in the same spirit whether I play or don   t play. Last season, I didn   t play a lot, but in every training session, I tried to give my best to try to make an opportunity to be in the squad. Now, I   m confident and want to give more for this club and my team-mates." Despite spending much of last season unable to break into the team, the former Nice man talked up the benefits of competition for places in Leicester's squad.
