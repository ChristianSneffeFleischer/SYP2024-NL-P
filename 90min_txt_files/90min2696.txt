Rangers midfielder Glen Kamara was left out of the squad to face Hibernian because of the ongoing uncertainty surrounding his future. 90min understands the former Dundee midfielder wasn't included by Giovanni van Bronckhorst for the 2-2 draw at Easter Road - a game the visitors finished nine men with after red cards for Alfredo Morelos and John Lundstram - and not because he asked not to play. The 26-year-old has been linked with a move away from Ibrox all summer long, with 90min previously revealing Brighton's interest in bringing him to the Premier League. Galatasaray also made two bids for Kamara earlier in the summer - before turning their attention to Lucas Torreira - while Salernitana and Besiktas have also shown interest. But 90min understands that Ligue 1 side Nice are now lining up a bid to bring him to the south coast of France, having already strengthened their squad with the signings of Kasper Schmeichel and Aaron Ramsey among others. Kamara joined Rangers on an initial pre-contract agreement January in 2019 before the Ibrox club moved to secure his services permanently in the same month for a fee of  Â£50,000. The former Arsenal youth product has gone on to make just under 100 appearances for Rangers, starring in their Scottish Premiership title success under the guidance of Steven Gerrard in 2020/21. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  &  Toby Cudworth  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Erik ten Hag wanting to sign five players before the transfer window closes, and Man Utd's attitude to selling Cristiano Ronaldo.
