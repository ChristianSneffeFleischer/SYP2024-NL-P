West Ham United are closing in on the signing of Sassuolo striker Gianluca Scamacca, 90min understands. The 23-year-old, who scored 16 goals in 36 Serie A appearances last season, has jumped to the head of West Ham's striking targets after a lack of movement in the club's pursuit of Chelsea striker Armando Broja, who a bid has also been tabled for. 90min revealed last Friday that a deal had been agreed in principle with Sassuolo, with an eventual fee likely to be in excess of    40m, though the Italy international hadn't at the time agreed to move to London Stadium - PSG and Juventus other sides to have shown an interest in signing him this summer. But sources have confirmed to 90min that a deal is now close to being concluded, with West Ham set to pay around    43m for Scamacca -    36m guaranteed and    7m in performance related add-ons and bonuses. Listen now to 90min's Talking Transfers podcast, with  Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  &  Toby Cudworth.

In addition to pursuing Scamacca, whose potential arrival would provide long overdue competition for Michail Antonio, West Ham are in talks to sign Eintracht Frankfurt star Filip Kostic, who shares the same agent as the Sassuolo striker. Kostic was a key part of the Frankfurt side that saw off West Ham in the semi-finals of last season's Europa League and he also netted his penalty in the dramatic shootout win over Rangers in the final.
