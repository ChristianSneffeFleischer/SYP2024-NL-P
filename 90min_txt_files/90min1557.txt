Barcelona are leading the race to sign Under-20 South American Championship winner Vitor Roque from Athletico Paranaense, 90min understands. The 17-year-old caught the eye at the Under-20 South American Championships, scoring an impressive six goals in eight appearances as a mightily talented Brazil won the competition in February. At club level with Athletico Paranaense, Vitor Roque has already scored 14 goals too.  Vitor Roque is well known as being one of the better 'wonderkids' on Football Manager 2023 due to his ruthlessness in front of goal at such a tender age.  The youngster's form (in real life...not FM23) has led to a number of top European clubs taking an interest in signing the forward in the near future, with sources telling 90min that Barcelona currently lead the race for his signature.
