Wolves have agreed a deal with Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal to sell midfielder Ruben Neves, 90min understands. The 26-year-old will enter the final 12 months of his contract this summer and has made it clear that he is prepared to leave Wolves, who have accepted a bid to sell Neves to Al-Hilal which is worth around  Â£45m. Al-Hilal have offered a significant contract to Neves which has been approved by agent Jorge Mendes, and sources have confirmed to 90min that the player is now mulling over his options. Neves has never hidden his desire to play in the Champions League and Barcelona have explored signing the midfielder. Personal terms were agreed with Mendes but the La Liga champions have other transfer priorities and have not yet moved forward with their interest. That has allowed Al-Hilal to make a move for Neves and 90min understands there is confidence among the Saudi outfit that they have already wrapped up his signing. feed There is believed to be interest in Neves' services from around the Premier League but, as with Barcelona, the Portugal international is not a priority target for any sides in England. Wolves have not yet given up hope of retaining Neves but Mendes has made it clear to Al-Hilal that a transfer to Saudi Arabia is the likeliest outcome, particularly given their concerns over meeting Financial Fair Play regulations have left them needing to raise money. Should Al-Hilal complete the deal, it would represent a drastic shift in approach from the Saudi Pro League. Up until this point, officials have focused largely on free agents or ageing players, but a big-money move for a 26-year-old will be sure to send shockwaves around Europe.
