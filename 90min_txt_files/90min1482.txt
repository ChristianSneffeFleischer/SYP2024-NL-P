RB Leipzig centre-back Josko Gvardiol will not be rushed into making a decision on his future as he weighs up his options, sources have confirmed to 90min. Gvardiol almost joined  Chelsea last summer, but a deal could not be agreed and the Croatian international signed a new contract with Leipzig - a signal of his value to the Bundesliga outfit. He then enjoyed a brilliant World Cup finals, emerging as one of the most in-demand defenders in the world, and most of Europe's top sides are expected to involve themselves in what could be a huge transfer scramble during the summer. Since their  failure  to land him last summer, Chelsea have signed Frenchman Benoit Badiashile and also have Levi Colwill, currently on loan at Brighton, to return in the summer. Whether Chelsea rekindle their interest or not remains to be seen but the battle to land Gvardiol is intense nonetheless, with Real Madrid positioning themselves in a very favourable position. 90min has been told that Luka Modric has been spoken to by  Real officials about his fellow countryman and  the veteran midfielder delivered  a glowing reference. Real are believed to  see Gvardiol as the ideal option to bolster their  central  defensive options, especially as a left-sided talent.
