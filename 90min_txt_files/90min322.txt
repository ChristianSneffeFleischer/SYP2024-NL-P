Thanks to this form, PSG have opted to use their reported  Â£5m buy-back option to re-acquire his services. Following on from re-signing the 20-year-old, PSG have now also agreed to send the player to Bundesliga outfit RB Leipzig on loan until the end of the season. A club statement from PSG on the move reads: "After a season with PSV Eindhoven, Xavi Simons has returned to Paris Saint-Germain until 2027. The Dutch attacking midfielder will be loaned out to German club RB Leipzig for the 2023-2024 season." feed Speaking to RB Leipzig's official channels after signing on loan, Simons expressed his excitement at playing in the Bundesliga: "The Bundesliga is one of the best leagues in Europe and RB Leipzig are one of the best teams in the Bundesliga. Coming to Leipzig is the right step for me because RBL constantly show how to develop young players and be successful with them. "I'm joining a club that regularly plays Champions League football. The squad has the perfect mix of lots of young and experienced players, and the whole club is hungry for success. I was immediately impressed by RB Leipzig's style of play and I strongly believe that my qualities will be a good match for this team and we can achieve a lot together. "I can hardly wait to play with my new teammates and to start the new season. Leipzig - I can't wait!"
