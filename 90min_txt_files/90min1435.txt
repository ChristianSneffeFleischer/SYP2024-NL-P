West Ham United are leading the chase for Bournemouth left-back Jordan Zemura, who was dropped at the weekend over his contract situation, 90min understands. The 23-year-old has been one of the Cherries' more impressive players during a difficult run of results, but was left out of the side that beat Liverpool 1-0 at the Vitality Stadium on Saturday. Manager Gary O'Neil told The Daily Echo of his absence:    Just an internal decision that JZ shouldn't be in the matchday squad today. So that was all really.    I don't want to go into the details." Zemura saw a one-year contract extension clause triggered in March 2022, but 90min understands that Bournemouth have been unable to agree terms over a new deal. West Ham showed an interest in signing Zemura last summer and sources have confirmed to 90min that the Hammers, who like Bournemouth are fighting for their Premier League lives, remain keen on signing the Zimbabwe international. READ NEXT manual Newcastle, Leeds and Aston Villa are also admirers of Zemura, while interest has been shown in his services from clubs in Germany and France. Emerson Palmieri and Aaron Cresswell are currently West Ham's options at left-back, with the former displacing the club's longest-serving player as David Moyes' first choice. Sourcing a long-term replacement for 33-year-old Cresswell is seen as one of the club's higher priorities, but results on the pitch are of more concern after Sunday's 1-1 draw with Aston Villa left West Ham outside of the relegation zone only on goal difference. AEK Larnaca await on Thursday as West Ham continue their Europa Conference League adventure, before crucial back-to-back home games against Southampton and Newcastle after the international break.
