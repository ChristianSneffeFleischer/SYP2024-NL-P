Bayern Munich have confirmed the signing of goalkeeper Yann Sommer on a two-and-a-half year deal. The Bavarian club had been on the lookout for a new starting goalkeeper to fill in for Manuel Neuer, following the 2014 World Cup winner's season-ending injury before Christmas.  And they've got their man in the shape of Swiss number one Sommer.  Speaking to his new club's official website following the move, Sommer said:    I   m very excited about the new challenge at FC Bayern. It   s a big, powerful club. We   ve played against each other many times     I know the enormous quality and aura of this club. I   m proud that I   m now a part of FC Bayern.
