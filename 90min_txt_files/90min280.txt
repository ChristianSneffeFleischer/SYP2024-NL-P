Atalanta manager Gian Piero Gasperini believes striker Rasmus Hojlund is happy with the Serie A side but admitted that a significant offer from Manchester United could leave them unable to say no. United have focused their efforts on 20-year-old Hojlund, who has openly discussed his desire to play for the Red Devils in the past, and have struck an agreement over personal terms with the Denmark international. The stumbling block currently is Atalanta's asking price. While the club have publicly demanded close to    100m, Atalanta are understood to be prepared to accept a fee of around    70m, but United are not prepared to meet such a demand at this point. Asked for an update on Hojlund's future at the club, Gasperini insisted the striker is loving life at Atalanta but admitted that money often plays a deciding factor. "I haven't spoken about the future with Rasmus," Gasperini said. "I think he is very comfortable here. feed "Sometimes there are choices to make and also agents... we all have to consider the financial factor. Atalanta, due to certain contracts and figures, can hardly refuse certain offers. "I   d love to keep Rasmus of course but sometimes clubs and also players have to consider huge bids." United are looking to strike a deal to sign Hojlund for around    60m but Atalanta are determined to secure a further    10m for a player who ended last season with ten goals and four assists from 34 appearances in all competitions. Terms of a payment structure are also understood to be dividing the two teams, while United's attempts to lower the asking price by offering players in exchange to Atalanta have been rejected.
