Real Madrid are preparing to move for Sevilla goalkeeper Yassine Bounou, 90min understands, as they look to cover the long-term absence of Thibaut Courtois. The Belgian suffered an ACL injury during a training session earlier this week and will soon undergo surgery, which will keep him on the sidelines for the vast majority of the 2023/24 La Liga season. With Ukraine international Andriy Lunin the only other goalkeeper in Carlo Ancelotti's squad, Madrid are prepared to enter the transfer market for a new stopper and have identified a number of potential targets. Contact has been made with former Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea, while Chelsea's Kepa Arrizabalaga is also seen as a candidate for a loan move, but sources have confirmed to 90min that Bounou is at the top of Madrid's wish list. 32-year-old Bounou, who excelled with Morocco at the World Cup, has made 157 appearances in La Liga across his career, emerging as one of the division's most-reliable stoppers since his switch to Sevilla in 2020. feed 90min understands that Bounou has made it clear he would like the chance to move to Madrid and Sevilla are prepared to do business for a fee of around    20m ( Â£17.3m). Madrid were not planning to do any additional business after an expensive shopping spree which brought Jude Bellingham, Arda Guler, Fran Garcia and Joselu to the club, but Courtois' serious injury has forced them back into the market. While club officials are understood to be fans of Lunin, there is a desire to bring in a goalkeeper with more La Liga experience as Ancelotti seeks to wrestle the league title back from rivals Barcelona. Defence was a real issue for Ancelotti during pre-season, with the Spanish side conceding eight goals across four games, and the injury to Courtois has only complicated his attempted solution.
