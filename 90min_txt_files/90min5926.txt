Tottenham have been linked with a surprise move for Atl  tico Madrid striker Diego Costa, who has been made available for sale this summer by Diego Simeone. Harry Kane is the undisputed starting striker at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, but there is a clear lack of a recognised back up to fill the void left by the Englishman when he is unavailable - which has been often in recent seasons. After a long-term injury last season for Kane a host of strikers were linked with Spurs in the January transfer window to act as a stop-gap, although no deal could be struck and a combination of Lucas Moura and Son Heung-min ultimately took over the mantle. With the Rojiblancos willing to part with the 31-year-old, the Mirror claim that he has been 'offered' to Tottenham for a potential reunion with Mourinho, under whom he played at Chelsea between 2014 and 2015 and won a Premier League title. Despite the report stating that the striker has been 'offered' to Spurs, the connections stop there. No further mention of such contact exists, merely that it's an avenue Spurs could consider as he is surplus to requirements at Atl  tico. There is mention of Mourinho and Costa still keeping in touch with one another, which may very well have heightened the speculation. However, if Spurs do take that option  then they could face competition from Benfica, who are also monitoring the situation. Although Costa was prolific under Mourinho in his previous spell in London, he's struggled for form since rejoining Atl  tico in 2017, netting just 17 times in 74 outings over the past three seasons, while there are also concerns over his age and fitness.
