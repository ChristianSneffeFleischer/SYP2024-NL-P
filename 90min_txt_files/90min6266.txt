Newcastle United are considering a summer move for Crystal Palace defender Patrick van Aanholt, as they look to strengthen the left hand side of their defence with a permanent signing. The Magpies have largely been reliant on loanee Danny Rose, who has missed just three games for the club since arriving in January, but the Englishman is, as it stands, set to return to Tottenham Hotspur at the end of the season. With Matt Ritchie the only other player capable of covering, reinforcements are required - and the printed edition of The Sun (via HITC) claim that Van Aanholt is being eyed up by Newcastle, with manager Steve Bruce thought to be an admirer. The 29-year-old has become a key player for Palace after joining from Sunderland for  Â£14m in 2017, playing over 100 times for the Eagles so far. He's made a name for himself as one of the more impressive attacking full-backs in the division, with his crossing ability and pace two of his most well-known traits. He's also had a hand in scoring and setting up goals this season, scoring three of his own and contributing two assists. Were he move back to the north east, Van Aanholt would actually be joining Newcastle for a second time.
