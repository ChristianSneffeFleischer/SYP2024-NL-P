West Ham goalkeeper Roberto is close to leaving the club on a permanent basis, after an agreement was reached with Real Valladolid. The Spaniard was signed on a free transfer last summer and was called into action when first-choice goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski was stretchered off at Bournemouth in September with a hip problem. But his time between the sticks was an unmitigated disaster, and also coincided with a terrible slump in West Ham's form - a run of results that eventually cost Manuel Pellegrini his job as manager, and left the club embroiled in a relegation battle. He was shipped out on loan in January, joining Alaves, and The Guardian now report that an agreement has been reached with Real Valladolid that will bring his nightmare West Ham spell to a permanent end. The Hammers have agreed to subsidise the 34-year-old's wages in order to get him off the books, something they also did last season when they contributed 75% of his  Â£30,000-per-week while he was at Alaves. West Ham moved to replace the Spaniard in the January transfer window, bringing Darren Randolph back to the club after a spell as Middlesbrough's first choice goalkeeper. They also have David Martin on their books as third choice, and he was preferred to Roberto by Pellegrini during the final few weeks of his tenure.  Summing up how bad Roberto's time at the club was, former Premier League striker - and current BT Sport pundit - Chris Sutton quipped after the 3-2 defeat to Tottenham at the London Stadium that he was among the worst goalkeepers he'd ever seen at the highest level.
