Manchester United have confirmed the signing of Netherlands international Wout Weghorst on loan until the end of the season. The tall striker was identified as a short-term solution to United's lack of depth up front, though the Red Devils had to navigate a transfer triangle of themselves, parent club Burnley and loan side Besiktas. The finer details have been smoothed out and United have now confirmed the deal. "I feel privileged to be joining Manchester United. I   ve played against the club in the past and it   s a fantastic feeling to now have the chance to pull on the famous red shirt," Weghorst said. "I   ve seen United   s progress under Erik ten Hag this season and can   t wait to start playing my part in pushing the team towards its aims. "Whatever happens in the next few months, I can promise to give everything to the club for as long as I am here. I thank everyone who has played a part in getting me to this stage, and now I am looking forward to meeting my new team-mates and getting involved straight away." It's the second move in the January transfer window to a Premier League club for Weghorst, who joined the Clarets from Wolfsburg last year. He managed two goals in 20 games as they were relegated but has been in better form in Turkey this campaign.
