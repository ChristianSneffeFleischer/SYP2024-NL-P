Barcelona remain confident that Gavi will sign a new long-term contract, despite interest in his signature emerging from several clubs across Europe, 90min understands. Gavi had agreed to sign a new deal earlier this year, with interested clubs told that he would be staying at the Catalan giants and was not looking to move. Bar  a   s plan was for the teenager to sign his new long-term contract when he turned 18 on August 5. However, that was not possible due to the club   s financial issues which saw them struggle to register new signings. Now that the transfer window has closed, Barcelona are now looking to finalise the extension of Gavi with his current deal due to expire next year. Gavi and his representatives, led by former Spain midfielder Ivan de la Pena, were ready to commit to a new deal, but they have been left frustrated by the delays, while Bar  a's links to Manchester City's Bernardo Silva did not go down well. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey,  Toby Cudworth  and  Harry Symeou  bring you a live deadline day edition of Talking Transfers. The team welcome  Daniel Childs  and  Julien Laurens  to the show to discuss Chelsea's late window activity, Arsenal's pursuit of Douglas Luiz, Paris Saint-Germain's summer signings & much more!

Sources with knowledge of the situation have confirmed to 90min that Manchester City, Manchester United, Chelsea and Liverpool have all held meetings about Gavi in recent weeks to keep abreast of his current situation.
