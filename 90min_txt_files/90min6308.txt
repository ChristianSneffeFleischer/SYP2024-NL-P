"The window will open for 10 weeks at the end of the current Premier League season, starting on 27 July and ending on 5 October.  "Following consultation with the EFL, a domestic-only window will be added from 5 October, closing 17:00 BST on 16 October. "During this window, Premier League clubs will only be able to trade with EFL clubs (either loans or permanent registrations).   "No transfers can take place between Premier League clubs in this period. The transfer window is subject to the approval of FIFA." Although nothing has been confirmed there is growing hope that the 2020/2021 English season will kick off safely at the start of autumn.  The weekend of 12 September has been touted as a likely start date with clubs being informed to prepare for social distancing measures inside stadiums. It is likely the arenas capped at a 40% capacity will be allowed at some point next season.
