Jordan Henderson is considering an approach from Saudi Arabian side Al Ettifaq over a move away from Liverpool this summer, 90min understands. Al Ettifaq have recently unveiled Liverpool legend Steven Gerrard as their new manager and the boss is now working to try and bolster his new squad to keep up with the wave of aggressive recruitment from across the Saudi Pro League. Gerrard is pushing to convince Henderson to make the move to Al Ettifaq and club officials have laid out their proposal for the 33-year-old Liverpool captain, who is understood to be considering the offer on the table. 90min understands that Henderson has not yet ruled out a move to Al Ettifaq and Liverpool are giving the midfielder time to make a decision. Reds manager Jurgen Klopp has, however, made it clear to Henderson that he does not want to part ways with the England international and he remains a big part of his plans. feed Should Henderson decide to accept Al Ettifaq's offer, 90min understands Liverpool will not stand in his way and will enter into negotiations with the Saudi side to try and thrash out a deal. Henderson still has two years remaining on the four-year contract he signed back in 2021 and so an agreement would have to be reached over a transfer fee if he is to leave Liverpool this summer. His 12 years at Anfield have yielded 492 appearances in all competitions, with Henderson wearing the captain's armband in Liverpool's famous Champions League and Premier League triumphs in 2019 and 2020 respectively. However, Henderson saw his role in the first team limited last season, making just 23 starts in the Premier League, and the summer arrivals of Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai have only added to the competition for minutes in Klopp's midfield.
