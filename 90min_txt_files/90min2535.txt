Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has completed his return to the Premier League after signing for Chelsea on deadline day. The Gabon striker left Arsenal for Barcelona at the back end of last winter's transfer window, with the Blaugrana signing him on a free transfer. Aubameyang was a huge part of Bar  a's renaissance under Xavi and scored 13 goals in 23 games, helping them finish second in La Liga. But after half a year at Camp Nou, Aubameyang is heading back to London and has signed an initial two-year contract with the option for a third at Chelsea for a    12m fee. Marcos Alonso will head to Barcelona as part of the deal. "I   m really happy. It   s an honour to be part of this team and I can   t wait to start. I have some unfinished business with the Premier League so it   s good to be back and really exciting," Aubameyang said. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey,Toby Cudworth  and  Harry Symeou  bring you a live deadline day edition of Talking Transfers. The team welcome  Daniel Childs  and  Julien Laurens  to the show to discuss Chelsea's late window activity, Arsenal's pursuit of Douglas Luiz, Paris Saint-Germain's summer signings & much more!

The striker grabbed 79 goals in 95 games under the German and brings much-needed scoring pedigree to a blunt Blues frontline.
