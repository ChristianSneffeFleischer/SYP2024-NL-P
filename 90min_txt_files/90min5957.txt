It's time for a major rebuild at Juventus, and to kick it off, they've made the surprising decision to appoint a head coach with no experience whatsoever - still, at least it's Andrea Pirlo.  The former World Cup winner has a huge job on his hands in Turin despite the Old Lady's domination in Serie A over the last nine seasons. Poor transfers and short-sighted decisions have led to an imbalanced squad that's in desperate need of a clear-out if they're to remain at the top of the table and challenge in Europe once again. Here, 90min take a look at who Pirlo should be looking to offload.  Gonzalo Higuain has had an impressive career scoring hundreds of goals, winning titles in Spain with Real Madrid and Italy with Juve. He enjoyed some of his best football under former boss Maurizio Sarri while at Napoli and was given another chance by him last season at the Allianz Stadium, but things didn't go quite as smoothly, netting only eight goals in 32 league games.His time at the top table of European football looks to be over, and with Juve wanting to trim their wage bill before bringing in any new recruits, Higuain should be one of the first names out the door, and reports suggest he could even walk away for nothing this summer.Potential Destination: MLS, Wolves, TottenhamPotential Price: Free if Juventus terminate his contract There's no doubting the talent that Douglas Costa possesses, but injuries and poor form have ravaged his time in Italy. Over the last two seasons, the Brazilian winger has made just 14 league starts, scoring a miserly two goals in the process. That's not the sort of return a winger for the best side in Italy should be producing during his prime years. Now 29, Costa could have one big move left in him and is currently being linked with Manchester United - Juventus should cash in while they can.Potential Destination: Manchester UnitedPotential Price:  Â£25m Khedira has proven to be a valuable player for the Old Lady since he made the switch from Los Blancos, but his time in Turin may be over. Pirlo will be hoping the addition of Arthur from Barcelona can provide some fresh legs in midfield, but 33-year-old Khedira no longer has it in him to physically command an elite midfield - and could also leave for free if the club cancel his deal.Potential Destination: MLS, West HamPotential Price: Free if Juventus terminate his contract
