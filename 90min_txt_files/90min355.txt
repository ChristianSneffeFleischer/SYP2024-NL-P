Gerard Pique has spoken highly of new Barcelona defender Inigo Martinez, particularly hailing the player's 'character'.  Martinez joined Barcelona as a free agent at the start of July, signing a two-year deal at Camp Nou following a hugely successful stint at Athletic Club. The 32-year-old comes to Barc with a wealth of La Liga experience, having played over 350 games for both Athletic Club and Real Sociedad.  Speaking to EFE, legendary Barca defender Pique gave his thoughts on the signing, hailing the player's ability on the ball and his character. "I coincided with him in the Spanish national team on some occasions, and he is a great player who has been in La Liga for years. He has played for both Real Sociedad and Athletic Bilbao, two great clubs in Spain, and he has a lot of experience," Pique explained. feed "He handles the ball very well, he has a great foot and a lot of character. "With him, the centre-back position is going to be even more competitive because Ronald Araujo is there, Christensen is there, and Jules Kounde can also play there. The team already showed last season that defensively they can compete at a high level, and we hope it continues that way." Martinez is one of three signings that La Blaugrana have made so far this summer, with Ilkay Gundogan also signing as a free agent following the expiration of his contract at Manchester City and the club recently confirming Brazilian prodigy Vitor Roque - who will not arrive until 2024.
