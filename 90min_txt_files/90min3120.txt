Steven Bergwijn has revealed why his move to Ajax is a step up after bringing a two-year stay at Tottenham to an end. The Netherlands international finally completed his long-awaited switch back to his homeland on Friday, having failed to nail down a starting XI spot under both Jose Mourinho and Antonio Conte. "It took a while, it was a lot of back and forth but here we are," he told  Ajax's official website. "It started about a year and a half ago. At a certain point, I started to play a bit less at Tottenham, then Ajax came knocking a few times. It almost happened then but, one way or another, it didn't work out then. Now, it has finally happened." Asked about Ajax's interest, he added: "I was a bit shocked. I didn't see it coming, actually. "But yeah I was getting left out of the team there and of course you just want to play. So if you can go back to Ajax it's quite tempting. They always do well in the league and the Champions League. So, it's a step up for me." Listen now to 90min's Talking Transfers podcast, with  Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey,  Harry Symeou  &  Toby Cudworth.
