Both Manchester clubs have launched    65m bids for Inter defender Milan Skriniar this summer. United and City have repeatedly been credited with holding an interest in the Slovakian international, but the Nerazzurri's exceedingly large asking price has prevented any move from materialising in the past.  However, Italian news outlet Tuttosport (via Sport Witness) report taht Inter can no longer demand a fee which exceeds    80m for Skriniar due to the defender's struggles this term, while the COVID-19 pandemic has also led to a deflated market.  The report claims United    put    65m on the table    for the 25-year-old earlier in the season, an offer matched by noisy neighbours City.  Real Madrid and Bayern Munich have also expressed an interest in acquiring the Slovak, but their proposals were turned down by Inter. However, the Nerazzurri are said to have altered their stance on Skriniar, with the Italian giants certainly more open to allowing the previously invaluable asset to depart this summer.  The arrival of Antonio Conte and his 3-5-2 system has coincided with a dip in form from Skriniar, with the feeling at San Siro that he's struggled to adapt to the demands brought about by playing in a back three. Since the restart, the Slovakia international was needlessly sent off in Inter's 3-3 draw with Sassuolo and was beaten way too easily one on one by Darko Lazovic for Verona's opener in their recent 2-2 draw.
