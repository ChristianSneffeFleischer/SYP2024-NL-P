West Ham full-back Harrison Ashby is due to undergo a medical on Tyneside on Sunday afternoon after agreeing a transfer to Newcastle, 90min understands. The Magpies have been looking for a new right-back since the summer to provide some cover for Kieran Trippier and they came close to striking a deal for 21-year-old Ashby back then, only for talks to collapse. This time around, a deal has been struck, with sources confirming to 90min that a fee of around  £3m has been agreed between the two sides. Ashby is expected on Tyneside imminently to put the finishing touches on the transfer, with Newcastle fans now waiting for confirmation of another deal after  £45m signing Anthony Gordon was spotted inside St James' Park.
