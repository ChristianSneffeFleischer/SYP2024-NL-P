Manchester United's offer to sign Frenkie de Jong from Barcelona has 'expired', but the Red Devils remain confident a deal for the Dutchman will eventually be agreed. Erik ten Hag has also had a change of heart and has decided that he wants to sell Cristiano Ronaldo, whose attitude behind the scenes has been a real concern for the under-pressure manager. Ronaldo could be replaced by Barcelona's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang or Leicester's Jamie Vardy, both of whom have been scouted by United chiefs. But Aubameyang, who is also of interest to Chelsea, has made it clear to Barcelona that he has no plans to leave Camp Nou this summer. In total, Manchester United want to bring in another five players before the transfer deadline on September 1. Kylian Mbappe has been left furious by Paris Saint-Germain's failure to sell Neymar this summer. The Frenchman is believed to have demanded that Neymar be sold for him to sign a new contract but the two are still teammates and have been in regular bust-ups in the dressing room. Chelsea have seen a second bid worth  £45m for Everton's Anthony Gordon rejected. The Toffees don't want to sell the 21-year-old but will use the negotiations to try and reunite manager Frank Lampard with young midfielder Billy Gilmour. The Blues could be open to parting ways with Gilmour after moving closer to a    15m deal to sign Inter youngster Cesare Casadei. Barcelona are hopeful of negotiating a discount with Manchester City over Bernardo Silva. The Portugal international is valued at    100m but Barcelona believe they can get that down to around    80m. The Camp Nou outfit are also close to bringing in Marcos Alonso from Chelsea in a  £6m deal. Manchester United are close to a deal to send young midfielder Hannibal Mejbri on loan to Birmingham City for the remainder of the season.
