Mauricio Pochettino has discussed Kylian Mbappe's failed move to Real Madrid and how it could affect his developing personality. Pochettino managed Mbappe for some 18 months while in charge at Paris Saint-Germain and had the task of dealing with some of football's biggest stars and personalities. When speaking up on his time in charge of those stars, such as Lionel Messi and Neymar, Pochettino was candid in his assessment of Mbappe. "Mbappe is younger (than Neymar and Lionel Messi) and still immature," he told Gazzetta dello Sport: "He is an animal; he has great charisma but he still needs to find himself.

"Leo and Ney are total players, they are more responsible although in different ways, while Kylian keeps looking for himself." Pochettino continued, discussing the 'maturity' that Mbappe had not yet found that other players had around him, stating:    We will see how this process will be affected by what has happened in recent months, with the failure (of his) move to Real Madrid." Mbappe was the subject of the summer's biggest transfer saga, having run down his contract at PSG amid a potential move to Real Madrid that appeared all but agreed. However, he sensationally turned his back on the move to the Santiago Bernabeu to pen a new contract in Paris - one of the biggest in sports history.
