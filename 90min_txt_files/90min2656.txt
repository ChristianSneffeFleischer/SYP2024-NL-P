West Ham United have opened talks with Lyon over the signing of Brazilian midfielder Lucas Paqueta, sources have confirmed to 90min. Arsenal and Newcastle have both been holding talks about a possible deal for Paqueta, but now West Ham have made a move to try and bring in him to London Stadium. The Hammers have endured a disappointing start to the new season and currently sit bottom of the Premier League, without a goal to their name. David Moyes has been looking for offensive reinforcements all summer long and now the club have made a move for Paqueta, who is a man in demand. 90min revealed earlier this month that the 24-year-old is available for  Â£33m and that is the price that West Ham are looking to pay Lyon. The player's agents are understood to be in London already holding talks, with the club acutely aware that other clubs are also monitoring his situation. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey,  Toby Cudworth  and  Harry Symeou  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Antony attempting to push through a move to Man Utd, Frenkie de Jong and Pierre-Emerick Aubayemang's futures at Barcelona and Arsenal's interest in Pedro Neto.
