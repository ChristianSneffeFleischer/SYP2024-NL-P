AC Milan have finally agreed a deal to sign Charles De Ketelaere from Club Brugge, 90min understands. Milan have been chasing the young forward all summer, with Leicester City and Leeds also interested.  However, De Ketelaere has always preferred a move to San Siro, with Champions League football on offer next campaign. As reported by 90min, personal terms have long been agreed, but the two clubs have been haggling over a fee.  Milan technical director Paolo Maldini recently travelled to the Belgian capital in an attempt to hammer out a deal to no success. Now though, an agreement has been reached at last. 90min has been told that the Rossoneri will be paying an initial    31m with    4m in add-ons to come for De Ketelaere. He is now waiting to undergo a medical before being unveiled as a Milan player. Leeds had held out hope right until the end of landing the prospect, but have ultimately been disappointed.
