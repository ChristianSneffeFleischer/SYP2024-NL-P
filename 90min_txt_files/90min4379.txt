AC Milan have officially confirmed the signing of Lille goalkeeper Mike Maignan, who will replace Gianluigi Donnarumma as the club's number one. Maignan has impressed during his time in France, helping Lille win Ligue 1 this season as they pipped giants Paris Saint-Germain to the title by a single point.

The Serie A club's statement reads: "AC Milan  is delighted to announce the signing of French player  Mike Maignan  from LOSC Lille, who will be joining the Club starting from 1  July 2021. The goalkeeper has signed a contract with the Rossoneri until 30 June 2026 and will wear the number 16 jersey." Maignan developed in the youth ranks at PSG but never made a senior appearance before his 2015 move to Lille. He became Les Dogues' first choice stopper in 2017/18. He was named as Ligue 1's best goalkeeper for the 2018/19 season and recently helped Lille to their first league title since 2011. Maignan will replace Donnarumma, whose departure has already been confirmed. Technical director Paolo Maldini was scathing in his comments on the Italy international's departure, quipping: "People sometimes don   t realise what it means to be a professional." Donnarumma has long been touted for an exit from San Siro and 90min understands Premier League outfit Chelsea are continuing talks with the 22-year-old, who racked up 251 appearances for the Rossoneri having made his debut at 16.
