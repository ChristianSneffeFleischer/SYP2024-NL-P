Inter are said to be 'dreaming' of signing superstar Lionel Messi in 2021 when his current Barcelona contract expires - but reports from Spain have rubbished such a move.  The 33-year-old has enjoyed yet another phenomenal season in 2019/20 despite the club's difficulties both on and off the field, grabbing 30 goals and 26 assists in just 42 appearances in all competitions.  Is Lionel Messi losing patience with Barcelona? pic.twitter.com/27FnJhkwW7 Messi has been linked with an exit from Camp Nou on a number of occasions in the past, but it was never really worth taking much notice of. However, with the Argentine clashing with board members such as Eric Abidal this season, as well as hitting out at his side's performances on the pitch which resulted in Bar  a missing out on the league title, it has been suggested Messi could leave the club when his contract expires in 2021.  The front page of La Gazzetta dello Sport (via Marca) claims Inter remain very keen on landing Messi's services, with the club's majority shareholders Suning Holdings Group preparing for a 'lengthy pursuit' of the forward. It is further noted that in the Italian media, there is growing optimism that Inter can pull off a 2021 move for Messi. However, this has been dismissed by Mundo Deportivo. When alluding to the chances of Inter bringing in Messi, the report simply states 'forget it.' Reports have alluded to the fact that Messi's father Jorge is moving to Milan (for business reasons), therefore adding to the growing belief that Lionel could follow his father to Italy.
