Jan Bednarek is keen to leave Southampton this summer and is the subject of interest from Leicester, Milan and Napoli, 90min understands. The 26-year-old initially joined the Saints in 2017 from Lech Poznan in his home country and has since gone on to make 149 appearances for them. But the Poland international, who has three years left on his deal, is now intent on leaving St Mary's and he won't be short of suitors, while Southampton are open to selling the defender for the right price. Leicester - who signed fellow defender Jannik Vestergaard from Southampton last year - looked into a deal for Bednarek back in January amid their alarming centre-back shortage last season and retain an interest in his services. The Foxes will become the only Premier League club yet to complete a signing this summer once Chelsea confirm the arrival of Raheem Sterling. Bednarek is also wanted in Italy with Napoli and reigning Serie A champions Milan joining the race for his signature.
