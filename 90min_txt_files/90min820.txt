Bayern Munich are ready to rival Arsenal for the signing of Chelsea forward Kai Havertz, 90min understands. The Germany international has been heavily linked with a move away from Stamford Bridge this summer. 90min reported earlier this week that Arsenal were in talks with the Blues over a shock move across London, while Real Madrid had previously explored replacing Karim Benzema with Havertz but did not want to meet his lofty price tag. Bayern are also on the hunt for a new centre forward this transfer window, with 90min reporting back in March that they were considering a move for Havertz. Sources have confirmed that the Bavarians are stepping up their interest in the 24-year-old and are in talks over a deal. Arsenal are not out of the picture just yet despite Bayern's re-emergence in the race, with Havertz believed to be open to either a move to the Emirates Stadium or the Allianz Arena. feed Speaking earlier in 2023, Havertz admitted that it would be hard to turn down Bayern if they came calling, while he would also like to work with Thomas Tuchel again following their time together at Chelsea. "Bayern is a huge club and for me, especially as a German, it's difficult to say no - but my goal has always been to play abroad and see a new country," he said. When asked whether he'd want to link up with Tuchel again, Havertz replied: "Definitely! You never know what will happen in football. Everything can happen very quickly. Never say never." Havertz has struggled to consistently make an impact at Chelsea following his 2020 move from Bayer Leverkusen, though did score the winning goal in the 2021 UEFA Champions League final against Manchester City. Meanwhile, 90min also reported on Friday that Bayern are in talks with Manchester City defender Kyle Walker.
