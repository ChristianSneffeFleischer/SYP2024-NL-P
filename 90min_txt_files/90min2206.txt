About me and Chelsea? I don   t know. You know what happened in the last few months. To be honest, I have no idea," he told The Athletic.    My agent is taking care of this and we will see. Right now, I   m happy in Leipzig. I don   t know, we will see - you never know. You know the stories and these things, but all I can say is that I   m happy in Leipzig and right now I   m going to stay there and perform for them.    Gvardiol added:    It   s a big club of course and, who knows, maybe one day I will be there. It   s really nice to see things like this, especially because there is Kovacic, so you never know. I talk with him.      Even to be here on this, the biggest event, it   s a big thing for me at 20 years old so I   m happy. I have to think about it.
