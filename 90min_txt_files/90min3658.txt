Caden Clark will have to wait to begin his German adventure, with RB Leipzig set to loan him back to the New York Red Bulls until the summer. The 18-year-old signed a deal with Leipzig last summer but was allowed to remain with the Red Bulls to complete the 2021 MLS season. "In Clark, we have once again pulled off the signing of a highly talented young player and have been able to tie him down for the long term," Leipzig's commercial director Florian Scholz said in a statement at the time. "This signing completes another piece to our puzzle for our squad planning at an early stage. We decided that a loan back would allow Caden, at just 18, a whole season in MLS before he joins us here at Leipzig." According to Bild (via MLS.com), Leipzig see no value in moving Clark away from his homeland with all the challenges currently being presented by the COVID-19 pandemic.  The teenager would have been due to report for training on Monday as Bundesliga sides emerge from their winter break, but will now remain in the United States to begin preparations for the 2022 MLS season, if reports are correct. Per Bild, #USMNT prospect Caden Clark won   t be with RB Leipzig on Monday for training restart & will instead be loaned back to sister club NY Red Bulls. Bild   s info is that it makes no sense to bring Clark over in Corona times with all the assorted difficulties. Despite earning his big move, Clark struggled at times in 2021. The attacking midfielder notched four goals and three assists for the Red Bulls last season, but was restricted to just 17 starts - some long spells with few minutes and no direct goal involvements punctuated his season.
