PSV Eindhoven have made the decision to keep in-demand Cody Gakpo this summer, 90min understands. The 23-year-old has attracted significant interest over the past few months, with numerous sides in England chasing his signature. Manchester United spent plenty of time monitoring Gakpo as part of their quest to bolster their forward line, while more recently, Southampton and Leeds were battling it out to secure his services, with both sides believing they could win the race. Sources have revealed to 90min that Southampton believed that they had a deal for Gakpo wrapped up, while Leeds were working until the early hours of Thursday morning to negotiate an agreement with PSV. But the Eredivisie side have now snubbed both offers. PSV boss Ruud van Nistelrooy had stressed his desire to keep Gakpo and the decision has now been made for the the 23-year-old to continue in Eindhoven. "I am really convinced that we will keep everyone on board," Van Nistelrooy said on Wednesday. Instead, a fresh round of contract talks could be opened with Gakpo, who only signed a new four-year deal back in January, with any new contract likely to contain a release clause.
