Michy Batshuayi's Chelsea career has come to an end after completing a permanent move to Fenerbahce on Friday evening. The Belgium striker joined the Blues in 2016, beating stiff competition from London rivals Tottenham and West Ham for his signature. While he would be used sparingly over the course of his stint at Chelsea and spent most of his time out on loan, he notably scored the goal that sealed their 2016/17 Premier League title and was part of their FA Cup-winning squad the following year. He has now completed a move to Fenerbahce, returning to Turkey after spending last season on loan at Istanbul rivals Besiktas. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey,Toby Cudworth  and  Harry Symeou  bring you a live deadline day edition of Talking Transfers.

The 28-year-old was close to joining Premier League newcomers Nottingham Forest on deadline day, but the East Midlands side were unable to complete a deal in time.
