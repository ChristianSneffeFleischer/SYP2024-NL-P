Women's Super League clubs are already preparing for the start of the 2020/21 season, with the summer transfer window now in full swing. Here's a roundup of new signing and every departure this summer... Following on from the January capture of Caitlin Foord, there is a distinct Australian theme to Arsenal's summer recruitment as they try and take the title back from Chelsea. Steph Catley and Lydia Williams were both teammates of Foord in last summer's World Cup squad. Might that be something to do with the fact that manager Joe Montemurro is...Australian? We couldn't comment.  ? Introducing our first summer signing (and it   s a big one)... @stephcatley ?

Among those who have been released is defender Jade Richards, who joined the club at the Under-10 age group.  @neetz2 is a Villan!? . #AVFC A post shared by  Aston Villa Women (@avwfcofficial) on Jul 6, 2020 at 5:01am PDT In: Chloe Arthur (MF) - BirminghamFreya Gregory (MF) - BirminghamAnita Asante (DF) - ChelseaDiane Silva (FW) - Sporting CPLisa Weiss (GK) - LyonCaroline Siems (DF) - Turbine PotsdamRamona Petzelberger (MF) - EssenStine Larsen (FW) - Fleury 91Abbey Jones (MF) - BirminghamOlivia Rebjohn (MF) - Birmingham Out:  Jade Richards (DF) - BlackburnKerri Welsh (FW) - releasedAlice Hassall (MF) - Coventry UnitedPhoebe Warner (MF) - Coventry UnitedMelissa Johnson (FW) - Sheffield UnitedCharlotte Greengrass (DF) - Nottingham ForestSophie Maierhofer (MF) - DuisburgDaniela Kosinska (GK) - Stoke The 2019/20 season was a tough one for Birmingham after a number of key players left last summer, with midfielder Emma Follis even stepping down a level to join Aston Villa. This season will be tougher still, with Lucy Staniforth and Rachel Williams the most high profile among another raft of departures.         We are delighted to announce the signing of @mollliegreen. #BCFC A post shared by  Birmingham City Women (@bcfcwomen) on Sep 7, 2020 at 5:13am PDT In: Christie Murray (MF)  - LiverpoolRachel Corsie (DF) - Utah Royals (loan)Chloe McCarron (MF) - LinfieldJamie-Lee Napier (DF) - Chelsea (loan)Destiney Toussaint (MF) - unattachedGeorgia Brougham (DF) - Everton (loan)Mollie Green (MF) - Manchester United Out: Brianna Visalli (MF) - Houston DashAdrienne Jordan (DF) - OL ReignFreya Gregory (DF) - Aston VillaAbbey Jones (MF) - Aston VillaOlivia Rebjohn (MF) - Aston VillaAlexandra Brooks (GK) - BlackburnChloe Arthur (MF) - Aston VillaLucy Staniforth (MF) - Manchester UnitedKerys Harrop (DF) - TottenhamRachel Williams (FW) - Tottenham Brighton have added international midfielders Inessa Kaagman and Nora Heroum to their squad this summer.

They have added quality to their squad, probably with an eye on their return to the Women's Champions League and the extra demands it brings.

Chloe Kelly is a big loss following her exit to Manchester City, but signing France international Valerie Gauvin is a major coup for the Toffees.  ??????? signing...

The 27-year-old had been with the Gunners since 2009 and despite injury problems is a valuable asset for the Royals in their quest to improve on a fifth-placed finish.  It is with great pleasure that we can announce that striker @daniellecarter joins Reading FC Women! ?    After more than a decade with @arsenalwfc, a couple of hat-tricks for the @lionesses s and a winning goal in the Women's FA Cup final, Danielle begins her new chapter as a Royal!
