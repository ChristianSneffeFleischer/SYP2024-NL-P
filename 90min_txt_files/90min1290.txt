AFC Bournemouth left-back Jordan Zemura has agreed a deal to join Udinese when his contract expires this summer, 90min understands. The Zimbabwe international has been coveted by several other Premier League clubs ahead of the expiration of his deal at the Vitality Stadium. 90min has previously reported that the likes of Crystal Palace and West Ham United had showed significant interest in Zemura, while others such as Aston Villa, Leeds United and Newcastle United are admirers. But sources have now told 90min that Serie A side Udinese are set to win the race for Zemura instead. The 23-year-old made his name at Bournemouth during their promotion-winning 2021/22 season, scoring three goals in 33 Championship games as the Cherries finished second. READ MORE FROM THE 90MIN TALKING TRANSFERS TEAM feed Zemura has played 22 times in all competitions for Bournemouth this term but has been left out of the matchday squad for their last five games and has since been demoted to their development squad. Udinese view Zemura as a long-term replacement for 20-year-old Destiny Udogie, whose loan from Tottenham expires this summer. Spurs beat Brighton to the signing of Udogie last year, agreeing to loan him back to Udinese for the 2022/23 season. 90min understands that Spurs have been particularly impressed with Udogie's progress this year, while he made his first visit to Tottenham Hotspur Stadium back in February, witnessing a 2-0 win against West Ham.
