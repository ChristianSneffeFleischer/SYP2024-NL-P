Bayern Munich coach Thomas Tuchel appeared to hint at the club's ongoing confidence that a deal for Harry Kane will be struck before the end of the summer when he refused to properly address the immediate future of emerging talent Mathys Tel over what could yet happen. Bayern retain longstanding interest in Kane and have been tracking the Tottenham striker ever since Robert Lewandowski was sold to Barcelona last summer without being directly replaced. The German champions have already seen two bids for Kane rejected, while a fresh meeting with Spurs official scheduled for last Friday ended up being postponed as talks continue. 90min reported on Friday that the clubs are now expected to meet in the coming days instead and that there remains a confidence on the German side that a deal will eventually be reached. feed Tuchel seemed to allude to that when he spoke about 'changes' that Bayern expect will happen. "We will discuss the exact future of Mathys as soon as something changes here and that could be much later in the transfer window," the coach explained. Tel joined Bayern from Rennes last year and only recently turned 18. He has already been likened to fellow countryman Kylian Mbappe and made 29 first-team appearances throughout 2022/23. Although Bayern won the Bundesliga again last season, they struggled without a direct replacement for Lewandowski. Sadio Mane was often asked to fill the void in what was an alien role for him, with the title not actually won until the final day of the season ahead of Borussia Dortmund.
