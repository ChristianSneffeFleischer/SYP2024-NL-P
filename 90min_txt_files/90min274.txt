Newcastle United have completed the signing of Harvey Barnes from Leicester City. The winger has become the Magpies' second addition to the first-team squad this summer, following on from the club-record transfer of Sandro Tonali from AC Milan. Sources have told 90min that Barnes has joined for a  Â£38m fee, and Newcastle are on the verge of selling Allan Saint-Maximin to Saudi Pro League side Al Ahli in order to fund the 25-year-old's arrival. 90min previously reported that West Ham United had held talks regarding a move for Barnes, while Aston Villa were also interested, but he has now completed a move to St James' Park.  feed Newcastle had explored the signing of Barnes' former Foxes teammate James Maddison earlier this transfer window, but he instead prioritised a move to Tottenham Hotspur. Barnes is yet to be capped by England's senior side but has previously been called into Gareth Southgate's squad, while he scored a career-high 13 Premier League goals last season despite Leicester's relegation to the Championship. Eddie Howe is looking to strengthen his squad ahead of the club's return to the Champions League, where they will enter the group stage as a pot four team.
