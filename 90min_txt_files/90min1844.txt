Arsenal are unlikely to sign France winger Moussa Diaby from Bayer Leverkusen this transfer window, sources have told 90min. The Gunners are looking to add another forward to their ranks this window, though have already missed out on the signing of top target Mykhaylo Mudryk to London rivals Chelsea. They have recently been linked with a move for Diaby, though 90min understands that such a transfer is currently unlikely. While sources close to Arsenal insist the club were first approached by the 23-year-old's representatives, the player's camp believe the opposite to be true. Nevertheless, both parties do not believe that a deal will be thrashed out this window. On this edition of Talking Transfers, Scott Saunders hosts Toby Cudworth & Graeme Bailey to discuss all the big transfer stories. This week's agenda includes Jude Bellingham, Harry Kane, Declan Rice, Hakim Ziyech, Leandro Trossard, Pedro Porro, Mykhaylo Mudryk and more!

Another major stumbling block is that Bayer Leverkusen's asking price for Diaby is thought to be higher than the    100m total package which Chelsea paid for Mudryk.
