Leeds CEO Victor Orta has revealed an agreement is in place for the club to take Jack Harrison on loan from Manchester City again next season. The highly rated attacker, who has spent the last two seasons on loan at Elland Road, is a key player for manager Marcelo Bielsa and looks set to remain for United's first campaign back in the Premier League since 2004. Speaking to Radio Marca, Orta confirmed a renewed loan deal is all but agreed despite speculation that a permanent move may have been on the cards earlier this year. A  Â£8m valuation appeared to have been reached between the two clubs but the global financial troubles may have resulted in a loan deal being a preferred route for all parties    A key player has been Jack Harrison, who will continue one more year with us in the Premier League,    Orta said. "We have reached an agreement with City and we will continue to do so on loan next season.    When I called David Villa, and he answered me about the player in such a blunt way, I got out of doubt and brought him to the club. He is a footballer whose ceiling is invisible.    Despite no official confirmation from either club as of yet, Harrison now looks set to become the second player Leeds have tied down for the 2020/21 season in the Premier League. The club have already confirmed the permanent signing of fellow winger Helder Costa from Wolves as they look to comprise a squad capable of competing in the top flight.
