Danish Superliga side AGF have announced the signing of former England international Jack Wilshere.  The midfielder had been without a club since the end of last season, having been released from his contract at Championship club Bournemouth.  Wilshere has signed a deal running until the end of the season, with an option for a further year at the club based on his performances.  Speaking after his move, Wilshere said:  "Since I started training with Arsenal, I have never hidden the fact that it was to be ready for 2022 and for a new club. Now the right club is here, and it will be an exciting new challenge for me.  "I am in a place in my career where I need to get started again after a difficult period and that opportunity has AGF offered me. For that I am very grateful, and I will do everything I can to live up to the expectations.
