Steven Bergwijn has completed his long-awaited move to Ajax from Tottenham, signing for the Dutch giants for    30m. The saga has dragged on throughout the summer transfer window and was subject to interest from Everton, but 90min recently revealed a fee had finally been agreed after months of hardball. We have reached agreement with Ajax for the transfer of Steven Bergwijn.Wishing you the very best, Stevie! Bergwijn joined the north London club in January 2020 as a highly-rated youngster and made a memorable start to his time in England, scoring on his debut against Manchester City in a 2-0 victory. However, he couldn't command a regular starting XI place and only scored eight goals in 83 games in all competitions. The 24-year-old did enjoy some memorable moments during his brief Spurs tenure. He scored their first goal of Project Restart in 2020/21 against Manchester United and netted in the home defeat to Aston Villa that season with fans allowed back in stadiums. His most important contribution, however, was his injury-time brace against Leicester back in January, coming off the bench to earn Tottenham a dramatic victory and reignite their Champions League hopes.
