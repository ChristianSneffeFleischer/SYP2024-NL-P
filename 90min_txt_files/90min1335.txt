Manchester City are ready to sell Aymeric Laporte with the defender in search of first-team opportunities, 90min understands. After knee surgery ruled him out for the start of this season, Laporte has been unable to regain his place in Pep Guardiola's side, with Ruben Dias, John Stones, Nathan Ake and summer signing Manuel Akanji often preferred. With only 16 appearances under his belt at club level this term, Laporte is ready to leave Man City in search of regular game time, and sources have confirmed to 90min that the club are happy to facilitate an exit. READ NEXT manual Tottenham Hotspur and Paris Saint-Germain are among the teams who have been offered Laporte's services, with both in need of reinforcements in the left-sided centre-back role. Spurs' contingency plan to missing out on Inter's Alessandro Bastoni last summer saw them sign Clement Lenglet on a dry loan from Barcelona, while PSG's only naturally left-sided centre-back options are the perennially injured Presnel Kimpembe and 17-year-old El Chadaille Bitshiabu. Barcelona were also previously keen on signing Laporte, but their interest has cooled after deciding to make a move to sign Inigo Martinez on a free transfer from Athletic Club instead. The 31-year-old was ironically bought by the Basque club as a replacement for Laporte when he left for Man City in January 2018. Meanwhile, Man City will look to add another left-sided centre-back to their ranks this summer. 90min understands that RB Leipzig's Josko Gvardiol and Eintracht Frankfurt's Evan Ndicka - the latter of whom is available on a free transfer - are among their targets.
