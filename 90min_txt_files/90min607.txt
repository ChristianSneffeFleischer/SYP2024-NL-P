Liverpool are progressing in talks to sign Dominik Szoboszlai from RB Leipzig, sources have confirmed to 90min. The Reds are continuing their search for new midfielders this transfer window following a disappointing 2022/23 season. They have already signed Alexis Mac Allister from Brighton & Hove Albion and remain interested in Bayern Munich's Ryan Gravenberch. 90min reported earlier this week Liverpool had touched base with the representatives of Szoboszlai over a summer move. There was initial hesitance that a deal could be agreed with RB Leipzig due to his  £60m release clause, but 90min understands talks have reached an advanced stage and Liverpool are hopeful of agreeing a fee closer to the  £50m mark. feed Liverpool have a great relationship with clubs in the Red Bull network having completed various transfers in the past, including Naby Keita and Ibrahima Konate from Leipzig as well as Takumi Minamino from Salzburg. Fabio Carvalho's season-long loan move to RB Leipzig was confirmed on Friday. Discussions for this deal have been kept separate to those regarding Szoboszlai. Newcastle United had also expressed an interest in signing Szoboszlai after missing out on the signing of James Maddison, who has joined Tottenham Hotspur instead.
