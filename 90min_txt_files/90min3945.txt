Andreas Pereira is set to join Flamengo on loan from Manchester United until the end of the season.   Pereira joined the club from PSV Eindhoven all the way back in 2012 and has since gone on to make 75 appearances, managing four goals and five assists in that time. He has enjoyed three loan spells over the course of his Red Devils    career, most recently struggling at Lazio last season.   Pereira will be heading out on a temporary basis again this term, according to various reports. This time he is jetting off to Brazil, with Flamengo close to agreeing a deal for his services. They won the Brazilian Serie A last year but are stuttering this time out, losing five of their first 14 games.   Pereira signed off from United for the season in some style recently, scoring a thunderous volley in a pre-season friendly draw with Brentford. He featured regularly for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer during the 2019/20 season, making 25 appearances in total. However, he has since slipped down the pecking order dramatically and it now seems close to certain that he will depart the club when his contract expires in 2023, if not sooner. As he did not feature at all last season, United will not need to bring in a replacement, but it could help them as they pursue a midfielder in the remaining days of the transfer window.
