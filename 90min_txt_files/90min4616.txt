Fikayo Tomori signed for AC Milan on loan from Chelsea earlier this year and it appears the Serie A giants are keen to sign the player on a permanent deal. As part of the initial agreement which saw the 23-year-old swap London for Milan, an option to buy clause to the value of  Â£24.1m was inserted. When discussing the Canadian-born defender's future, the Rossoneri's honorary vice-president Franco Baresi revealed the club's intentions:     We   ll do everything to sign him on a permanent deal", the legendary defender told Gazzetta dello Sport.    Two months are remaining until the end of the season, and it   s not only up to Milan. Tomori is imposing himself with talent and determination. He has shown no fear to play in a new league. Potentially, he can become a great champion. I hope he lives up to expectations.    To date, the player has appeared for Stefano Pioli's side on just 12 occasions but it seems he has shown enough to persuade the club that he is worth the aforementioned fee.
