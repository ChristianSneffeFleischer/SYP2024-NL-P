Chelsea have confirmed that they are nearing the signing of Mykhaylo Mudryk from Shakhtar Donetsk. 90min reported on Saturday evening that the Blues had hijacked Arsenal's attempts to sign the highly-rated Ukraine winger. The Gunners had been in extensive talks with Shakhtar regarding a deal for Mudryk but a fee proved to be a sticking point, with Chelsea in line to pay a package of up to    100m - a price Arsenal were reluctant to meet. And the west London club confirmed on Saturday night that a deal to sign Mudryk was close to completion. Chelsea said in a statement: "Chelsea are discussing terms with Shakhtar Donetsk for the transfer of Mykhaylo Mudryk. "Should a deal be agreed between the two clubs then the Ukrainian international, who can operate as a winger or a forward, will discuss personal terms with the Blues ahead of a permanent transfer."
