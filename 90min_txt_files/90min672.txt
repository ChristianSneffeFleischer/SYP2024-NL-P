West Ham United have rejected Manchester City's offer worth  £90m for Declan Rice, sources have confirmed to 90min. The Premier League champions formalised their interest in the 24-year-old with a bid on Monday night, comprised of  £80m in guaranteed money and  £10m in achievable performance related add-ons. City's bid was the same value as Arsenal's second offer for Rice which was rejected by West Ham last week. The Gunners had offered  £75m up front and  £15m in add-ons but had proposed to structure the payments over a number of years. West Ham have been steadfast in their  £100m valuation of Rice, who they have accepted wants to move on and compete in the Champions League, and 90min understands that City's bid was swiftly rejected. The Hammers also hope the offer will now spark a bidding war between interested parties. feed Arsenal are expected to return to the negotiating with a third offer and are acutely aware that West Ham have been left frustrated by the bids they have received so far. Nevertheless, Rice remains their number one transfer target and is known to have a friendly relationship with manager Mikel Arteta. Manchester United also hold a significant interest in Rice and are considering whether or not to make a bid. Neighbourhood rivals City, meanwhile, likely see the West Ham captain as a quality replacement for Ilkay Gundogan, who joined Barcelona on a free transfer on Monday after seven hugely successful seasons at the Etihad Stadium, and could return with an improved offer. The treble winners are also close to signing Mateo Kovacic from Premier League rivals Chelsea, in a deal that will be worth around  £30m.
