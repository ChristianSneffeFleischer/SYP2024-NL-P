Lieke Martens has hinted that she is keen to extend her stay at Barcelona beyond the conclusion of her current contract, which is set to expire at the end of this season. The 29-year-old is regarded as one of the finest players in world football, and was a key part of the Barcelona side who stormed to the treble during the 2020/21 campaign, hitting five goals as the Catalan giants won the Champions League for the first time. Martens joined Barcelona from  Swedish club Rosengard in 2017, and signed a three-year contract extension in 2019. However, with the deal poised to expire this coming summer, the Dutch international has reassured fans that she is in no rush to leave the club just yet. "I don't think I have taken everything out of my career," Martens told Forbes. "I feel really good this season. I just want to continue being part of this journey. I can't say much about anything yet. I am happy here, I love the club. I have had a really great time so far. Yes, of course, there's also a chance to stay, you have to be a little more patient!"
