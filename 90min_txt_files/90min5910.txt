Jurgen Klopp has reassured Liverpool fans over the club's lack of signings this summer, insisting that not disrupting their title winning team is preferable to bringing in a plethora of fresh faces. The Reds ran away with the Premier League title last season to be crowned champions of England for the first time in 30 years, but the  £11m signing of left back Kostas Tsimikas remains their only new addition thus far.

The Reds have been linked with Thiago Alc  ntara - with Bayern Munich holding out for  £30m - but Klopp insists Liverpool's thriftier approach this window has its benefits. "Every year it is harder," Klopp said [via the Daily Mail]. "Was it easy last year? For sure not. It looked in moments like it was but that was only because we were a result machine. That is the only reason. It was hard in every game. We had to fight so hard. 'If you make a lot of changes to a squad that is good. But it is better in the long term than the short term because you need to get used to each other. It is not a big advantage - it is a little advantage - but we are used to each other. We know what we are doing in specific moments. Big claim from Rooney. ? pic.twitter.com/vTPEEkVlQN
