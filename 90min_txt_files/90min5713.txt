Real Madrid winger Lucas V  zquez is considering leaving the Santiago Bernab  u this summer after receiving a sizeable offer from a club in Qatar. Manager Zinedine Zidane is a huge fan of V  zquez and is rarely afraid to call on him to fill a hole in almost any position in the team, but despite the Frenchman's admiration, V  zquez only managed eight La Liga starts last season. According to Marca, that lack of playing time has left the Spaniard considering his future at Real, with an unnamed club in Qatar prepared to pay him a huge wage to leave the La Liga champions this summer. V  zquez has asked for a few days to consider the proposal and Real have granted his wish. Club officials will not stand in his way if he chooses to leave as he has just one year remaining on his current contract. V  zquez is also waiting to see whether any other sides make an offer for him. Napoli and Tottenham Hotspur have both been linked, although neither have turned their interest into anything concrete thus far. Zidane and Real would be happy to keep V  zquez around for his versatility and reliability, but there is an acceptance that he is way down the pecking order at the Bernab  u and could well grow frustrated with his lack of minutes. He struggled to even start games in cup competitions last season, starting just once in the Champions League and once in the Copa del Rey, with the likes of Eden Hazard, Rodrygo and Vin  cius J  nior ahead of him in the hierarchy. A Real academy graduate, V  zquez has managed 206 appearances for the club in all competitions, chipping in with 24 goals and 46 assists.
