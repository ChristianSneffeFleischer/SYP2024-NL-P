Roma defender Chris Smalling is the subject of interest from several Premier League sides, sources have told 90min. The centre-back has revived his career since leaving Manchester United in 2019, joining the Serie A giants on an initial loan before making the move permanent a year later. Smalling is as important to Roma as ever at the age of 33, featuring in all but one game for them in all competitions so far this season. 90min understands that there are a number of English clubs looking to bring him back to his home country. High-flying Fulham - where Smalling began his professional career after joining from Maidstone United - are interested, as are Everton, Leicester and West Ham. On this edition of Talking Transfers, part of the 90min podcast network,  Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  &  Toby Cudworth  discuss Mauricio Pochettino turning down Chelsea, Leeds and West Ham's manager situation, Mason Mount links to Liverpool, Man City's interest in Declan Rice & more.

His contract expires in the summer though it retains a one-year extension option, and speaking to Sky Sport Italia, Smalling revealed his desire to stay in Rome. "I am very confident [about staying]...I have an option to renew for one year but I hope to stay for more seasons," he said.
