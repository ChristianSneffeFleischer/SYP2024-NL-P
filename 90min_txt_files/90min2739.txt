New Tottenham player Destiny Udogie has described his move to north London as a 'dream come true'.  The young defender became the Lilywhites' seventh signing of the summer window on Tuesday evening, completing his move from Serie A side Udinese. Udogie is now set to return to Udinese on a season-long loan before returning to Tottenham next summer. Speaking following the transfer, Udogie spoke of his delight to join a 'big club':  "It is a big honour for me to be here in this big team, big club with a big history. I always knew football was inside me. It was always my dream since a child. I started when I was four-years-old. I lived in Verona - 20 minutes from the centre. "My family is there with me. My family is everything because I ask them a lot of questions, they help me a lot, they're always with me. All of them they are very close to me and important to me. My father, he always pushed me a lot to be focused and serious on the game and I think this helped me a lot. When I see my friends play, going out, I prefer to stay home and relax for the training. "Hellas Verona was like the big dream. I grew up in Verona so it was the dream of every child in Verona. I was 10-years-old, I did like two weeks of trials and when I and when I entered I said: 'okay, this is the time for me to settle down and focus.'
