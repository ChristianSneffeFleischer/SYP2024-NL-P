Manchester United have confirmed that Marcos Rojo has completed his permanent transfer to Boca Juniors, bringing an end to six-and-a-half years at Old Trafford. Rojo previously left United on loan last January when he re-signed for boyhood club Estudiantes, but injury and the coronavirus pandemic limited the Argentina international to just one appearance. A post shared by Boca Juniors (@bocajrsoficial) Following his arrival from Sporting CP in 2014 after impressing at that year   s World Cup, Rojo played only 122 times for United in all competitions. His time in Manchester was marred by injury and poor form, with his last first-team appearance for the club in November 2019. It had been expected that Rojo would be released from his contract and make the move as a free agent. However, the club says he has moved for an    undisclosed fee   . Both a left-back and centre-back, Rojo showed at times that had the ability to be a key player for United. After a shaky start, he commanded a regular place during the 2016/17 season under Jose Mourinho, only to see his campaign ended by an ACL injury. He watched the 2017 Europa League final while on crutches alongside the similarly stricken Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Rojo never really recovered after that. He returned to action in November 2017 and signed a new contract until 2021 a few months later. But in his final two-and-a-half seasons with United the 30-year-old made only 17 appearances in all competitions. Manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has now successfully cleared the majority of the deadwood from the poorly built squad he inherited upon taking over in December 2018.
