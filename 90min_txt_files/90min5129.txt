West Ham midfielder Tomas Soucek has attracted the attention of German and European champions Bayern Munich, according to a report.  The Czech Republic international's fine form since his arrival in the Premier League from his homeland in January is said to have caught the eye of the Bavarian giants.  However, the Hammers are planning give their man a new contract in an attempt to stave off any interest and keep him at the London Stadium, having only made his loan deal from Slavia Prague permanent in the summer.

Soucek has become an integral part of David Moyes' side and has featured in 25 Premier League games for the Hammers, scoring six goals - three of which have come this campaign.  The Czech initially arrived at the club on a loan deal in January and, after a successful spell in the second half of last season, made his deal permanent for around  £15m as West Ham avoided relegation.  The player is very highly-rated and valued by the fans, as well as the club itself. His impact was demonstrated on Friday evening as he scored the equaliser at Leeds, helping the Hammers to eventually grab all three points in a 2-1 win.
