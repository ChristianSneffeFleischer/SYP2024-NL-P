Tottenham midfielder Harry Winks has admitted that he is struggling to recapture his best form because he is not playing regularly, which is leaving him low on confidence. Winks has only made six appearances in all competitions so far this season, with four of those in the Europa Conference League when manager Nuno Espirito Santo has rested most of the usual starters. His only Premier League start came in a 3-0 defeat to Crystal Palace last month. Winks, who turns 26 in February, only started nine Premier League games last season and hasn   t been a regular for Spurs since the 2019/20 campaign. He still has just under three years left on his current contract but is stuck in a vicious circle.    I love Tottenham but I want to play regular football,    Winks is quoted as saying by The Times.    The only way to play your best, get momentum is when you   re playing regularly. It is difficult when you get matches here and there, confidence is low.    I want to be at my best, firing. Ultimately it comes with me performing when I get the opportunity. If I   m not doing that I only have myself to blame.    I   m man enough to admit that I need to improve in certain areas. On the contrary, I need to play games and the only way to do that is getting minutes and getting that sharpness back.    Winks, who was first invited to join the Spurs academy at the age of just five, insists that he still wants to play for the club but will    have a conversation    about his future when the time is right.
