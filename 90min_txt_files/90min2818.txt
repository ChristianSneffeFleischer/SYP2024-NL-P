Bologna manager Sinisa Mihajlovic had admitted he is confident that the club will be able to hold on to striker Marko Arnautovic, despite interest from Manchester United. With doubts over the future of Cristiano Ronaldo, United have launched a bid for 33-year-old Arnautovic and are looking to get a deal done for under    10m, although 90min understands Bologna are holding out for    15m. Club director Marco di Vaio recently did his best to shut down the speculation, insisting Arnautovic is 'priceless' to the Serie A side, and now manager Mihajlovic has confirmed his desire to keep the Austrian as well. "Marko and I talk often, we have a relationship characterized by mutual respect," Mihajlovic told Mediaset. "Whether he stays or goes is not up to me, but rather the club. I hope he stays because it   s not easy to replace him. "If he leaves, I would be happy for him, but I don't think he will leave. I think he will stay and continue to behave with great respect."
