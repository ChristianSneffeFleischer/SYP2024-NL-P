Barcelona were prevented from signing Memphis Depay on deadline day as his arrival would have put them over the La Liga salary cap. However, Bar  a are ready to restart negotiations in January. The Lyon forward was being courted by the Blaugrana throughout the summer as they looked to bolster their attacking ranks following the departure of Luis Suarez.  A deal looked close to completion on Monday night, only for things to collapse at the last minute. Speaking on Catalunya radio show Onze, Oriol Domenech claimed that La Liga's salary cap was the reason for the deal falling apart. Despite managing to move on a number of players the summer, including Arthur, N  lson Semedo, Arturo Vidal and Ivan Rakitic, Depay's arrival would have still put them in breach of the league's financial rules. This forced La Liga to step in and block Depay's registration.  Ousmane Dembele abortive move to Manchester United could have helped avoid this disappointment. The handsomely paid Frenchman was in talks to join the Red Devils on deadline day but no move materialised, which in turn made the Depay switch not possible.
