Chelsea have completed the signing of 19-year-old midfielder Lesley Ugochukwu from Rennes. The Blues agreed a  Â£25m fee with Rennes in late July, prompting the final processes of the transfer     including a medical     to be undertaken in the days since. Ugochukwu has signed a seven-year contract until 2030, with an option to extend by 12 months. "We're delighted Lesley is joining Chelsea," said co-sporting directors Laurence Stewart and Paul Winstanley in a joint statement. feed "He is an impressive young player who has already made his mark in Ligue 1. He has a huge amount of potential and we know he is going to continue to develop and improve. We are pleased that he has joined us in the U.S and that he will be able to integrate with the squad quickly." 90min understands that, at present, a decision over where Ugochukwu will spend the 2023/24 season has not been made. It is possible that the teenager could be loaned to new sister club Strasbourg, which would see him remain in Ligue 1, to gain more first-team experience.
