Former Liverpool centre-back Jamie Carragher has urged his former side to delve into the January transfer market for Virgil van Dijk's replacement, offering RB Leipzig's Dayot Upamecano as a potential target. Van Dijk suffered a serious knee injury during Saturday's Merseyside derby after a nasty tackle from Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford. While neither the club nor the player have offered a concrete return date, Van Dijk's absence is thought to span the majority of the 2020/21 season. Virgil van Dijk will undergo surgery on the knee injury sustained during Saturday   s 2-2 draw at @Everton.Following surgery, Virgil will begin a rehabilitation programme to enable him to reach full fitness as soon as possible. You'll come back stronger, @VirgilvDijk ? Liverpool confirmed that the Dutch international will have surgery on his torn anterior cruciate ligament. Van Dijk's absence is a monumental loss for the Reds - the 29-year-old didn't miss a single minute of league football throughout Liverpool's title-winning campaign last season. While there are already options within their squad, Carragher has implored Liverpool to search for a replacement in the winter transfer window. Speaking on Sky Sports' Monday Night Football, Carragher said: "There was no doubt Liverpool had to go big in the transfer market next summer, that was the next one. That's got to be brought forward to 1 January. Not the end of January, not negotiating with the club..." While the show's presenter David Jones and guest former footballer Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink suggested that finding a centre-back of the requisite standard was a tough proposition, Carragher offered his own suggestion: "There's a young guy who everyone's talking about, there's one called Upamecano, who's at Leipzig.
