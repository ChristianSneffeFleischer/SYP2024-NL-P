Arsenal star Ainsley Maitland-Niles and Wolverhampton Wanderers defender Conor Coady have been called up to the England senior side by Gareth Southgate for the upcoming Nations League fixtures.  The Three Lions will take on Iceland in Reykjavik on Saturday 5 September at 5pm BST, and then travel to Copenhagen to play Denmark on Tuesday 8 September at 7.45pm BST.  And Maitland-Niles, fresh from his man of the match performance for the Gunners against Liverpool in the Community Shield final, has been selected to join up with his fellow England stars for that double header.  The versatile youngster, who celebrated his 23rd birthday in style on the Wembley Stadium turf, is set to be involved with the senior set up for the first time in his career, having previously experienced glory with the Under-20s at the 2017 World Cup.  It's a precarious time for the Arsenal star, whose future at the Emirates Stadium is in doubt. Maitland-Niles has been the subject of some interest from several Premier League sides, including Wolves, but speaking after the penalty shootout victory on Saturday evening, the defender gave no indication as to where he may end up by the time the transfer window closes.   "I   m an Arsenal player until I   m told otherwise," he said.  "My heart is in the club & while I   m here, I   m going to give 100 percent every time and that   s that."
