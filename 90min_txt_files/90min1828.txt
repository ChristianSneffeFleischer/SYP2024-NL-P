Tottenham Hotspur are ready to make a renewed attempt to sign long-term target Nicolo Zaniolo, sources have confirmed to 90min. Zaniolo was one of Spurs' top summer targets and the Lilywhites came close to agreeing a loan deal before Roma head coach Jose Mourinho stepped in to block the move. Roma attempted to negotiate a new contract with Zaniolo, but talks over a new deal stalled and things have also not gone particularly well on the pitch either - the 23-year-old was even booed by the club's fans during their Coppa Italia clash with Genoa. With just 18 months left on his contract, Roma and Zaniolo are now ready to part ways and the player's representatives have made his availability known. Zaniolo is greatly admired by Spurs head coach Antonio Conte and managing director of football Fabio Paratici, who has already had contact with his counterparts in Rome about a possible deal. Listen now as  Scott Saunders  hosts  Graeme Bailey  and  Toby Cudworth  in the latest episode of Talking Transfers. This week's agenda includes Jude Bellingham, Harry Kane, Declan Rice, Hakim Ziyech, Leandro Trossard, Pedro Porro, Mykhaylo Mudryk and more!

Roma had priced Zaniolo at    50m last summer, but 90min understands they would settle for a deal worth around    30m - but that could be in the form of a loan with an obligation to buy, which is the angle Spurs are looking at. There is rival interest in Zaniolo, however, with Borussia Dortmund and other Premier League clubs aware of his availability.
