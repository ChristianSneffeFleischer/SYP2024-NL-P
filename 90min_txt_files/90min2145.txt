Bayern Munich chief executive Oliver Kahn has ruled out a move for Croatia and Dinamo Zagreb goalkeeper Dominik Livakovic, who has shone at the World Cup in Qatar. The Bundesliga giants have a conundrum to solve in goal following the season-ending injury to Manuel Neuer, who broke his leg in a skiing accident and has since undergone surgery. "Manuel decided to take a little break from the tournament," Kahn told RG. "He needed rest after such stress. Neuer is a big fan of alpine skiing and went to the slopes. I know that he was warned several times that there was very little snow, stones were sticking out everywhere and it was dangerous to ride, but Neuer never listens to anyone. "As a result, rescuers removed him from the mountain, transported him by helicopter to the hospital where he underwent an operation.  "We've lost our goalkeeper before the end of the season. It's terrible because he is one of the best in the world. A very serious loss for the team. But we believe that the recovery will go well and his return too, but for now, we have to solve the problem of a replacement. But this is temporary. Manuel will be back."
