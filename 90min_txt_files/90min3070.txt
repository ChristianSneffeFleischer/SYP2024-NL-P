Leeds United are in talks with Paris Saint-Germain over a deal to sign for striker Arnaud Kalimuendo, 90min understands. A lack of options up front was a huge problem for head coach Jesse Marsch last season, especially with Patrick Bamford suffering a number of injury setbacks.

Kalimuendo has come through the youth system at the Parc Des Princes and made his first-team debut in 2020.
