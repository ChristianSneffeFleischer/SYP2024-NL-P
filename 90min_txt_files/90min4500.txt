MLS have confirmed that Inter Miami broke the league's spending rules to sign Juventus midfielder Blaise Matuidi last summer. American top-flight rules dictate that each club is permitted to have only three players classified as designed players on their roster at one time. A designated player is defined as an individual not subject to a salary cap - a rule introduced in 2007 to permit the arrival of David Beckham, who ironically now finds himself in hot water for not obeying said rule as the Inter Miami co-owner. The remainder of the squad are classed as TAM players (targeted allocation money) and a salary cap must be worked within when negotiating deals. It's now been revealed that Matuidi - whose wage is above the permitted threshold and so is classed as a designated player - was registered as a TAM player, meaning Inter Miami have broken MLS' spending rules. A statement released by the league confirmed the club had failed to obey the regulations and disciplinary action is expected to be taken. "Matuidi's compensation was above the compensation limit for a TAM player and he should have been classified as a designated player," the statement read (via BBC Sport). "As a result, Inter Miami CF violated the designated player limit as the team had three designated players in addition to Matuidi during 2020."
