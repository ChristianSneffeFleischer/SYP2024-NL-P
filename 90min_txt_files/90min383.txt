Chelsea and Crystal Palace have both held talks over signing Flamengo midfielder Matheus Franca, 90min understands. The 19-year-old is a regular part of the Flamengo squad and already has over 50 appearances for the first team, racking up nine goals for good measure. Both Aston Villa and Newcastle explored January bids for Franca but 90min understands that it is Chelsea and Palace who are in talks with Flamengo over a potential transfer this summer. Palace have identified Franca as a potential replacement for Wilfried Zaha, who is currently a free agent after his contract at Selhurst Park, although the Ivorian could still end up signing an extension. The Eagles could move for Franca even if they can re-sign Zaha. As for Chelsea, Franca is yet another talent who has been identified in the ramped-up scouting of South America, which has already seen Andrey Santos and Kendry Paez seal moves to Stamford Bridge. Santos winger Angelo Gabriel is expected to follow suit. feed Franca inked a new contract back in February and remains under contract until the end of 2027, giving Flamengo plenty of security when it comes to negotiations. Chelsea are keen to bolster in attack this summer and are also interested in another 19-year-old, Lyon's Rayan Cherki. As well as chasing new signings, Chelsea continue to discuss a number of potential sales and are hopeful of parting ways with Romelu Lukaku, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Callum Hudson-Odoi and Hakim Ziyech before the new season gets underway. Lukaku and Aubameyang have seen their pre-season return dates pushed back to Monday as Chelsea hope to have found buyers by then, while Hudson-Odoi is training with the Under-21s as he explores his own move away.
