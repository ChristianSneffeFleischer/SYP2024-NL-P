Brighton have announced signing of Joao Pedro from Watford for a club-record fee on a contract which will run until 2028. The 21-year-old previously played in the Premier League for the Hornets and has netted 11 goals in the Championship this season. The fee agreed between the two clubs is worth over  £25m. 90min revealed in late April the transfer would be a club record for Brighton, whose previous biggest outlay was the  £20.7m they forked out for Enock Mwepu in 2021. Pedro will join the Seagulls when the transfer window officially opens. He is another young talent to add to their forward line alongside Evan Ferguson, who has netted four league goals this season.  Technical director David Weir said: "Joao has been a long-term target of ours, and he has also attracted a lot of interest from across Europe. manual "So, we are delighted to have reached an agreement with a key target for the club ahead of the summer window opening, and it is great for Joao that he can focus on the new season, with his immediate future settled. "He's a brilliant young talent, technically very good, quick and with an eye for goal. He will complement our existing forward line very well. He also has settled well here, with good experience of both the Premier League and Championship and more than 100 games for Watford. "We are really looking forward to starting work with him in pre-season, here in the UK and when we travel to the United States for the Premier League Summer Series." Pedro joined Watford from Fluminense in 2020 and scored his first goal in England's top flight a year later against Manchester United.
