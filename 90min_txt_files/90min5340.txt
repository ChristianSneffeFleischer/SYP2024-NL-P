Sa  d Benrahma's permanent move to West Ham could yet be in jeopardy as the Algerian ace is set to undergo a second medical at the end of the season before the move can be finalised. After Benrahma's parent club Brentford failed to achieve promotion via the play-offs last season, a whole host of Premier League sides were said to be interested in acquiring the services of the 25-year-old. Following a summer of speculation, West Ham appeared to have won the race to sign Benrahma, only for an issue with the blood tests taken as part of his medical to cause the deal to almost collapse. The Hammers eventually secured a season-long loan deal for the Bees talisman, with an initial fee of  £5m agreed ahead of a potential permanent move the following summer in a transfer worth up to as much as  £25m. However, Football Insider has revealed that there could yet be further complications before the Algeria international makes his permanent switch to the London Stadium in 2021, with Benrahma required to take a second medical before West Ham can officially confirm the transfer. The loan signing of the former Nice man went some way to relieving the pressure on the West Ham board after they sanctioned the departure of talented youngster Grady Diangana earlier in the window.
