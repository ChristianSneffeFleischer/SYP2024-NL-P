Newcastle United remain keen on bolstering their attacking options and 90min understands they still want to add a new striker and right winger before the transfer window closes. Having failed to get anywhere with a deal with Bayer Leverkusen for leading target Moussa Diaby, whose asking price of more than  £50m was deemed too much at this stage of their project, Newcastle have moved on to other targets as their frustration with the market has grown. 90min has been told by sources that Newcastle are agitated by the stances of certain agents and clubs, who they believe are clearly using them to generate further interest in their clients from elsewhere. Leeds United's Jack Harrison remains a player of significant interest and 90min understands a new approach was made and rebuffed this week. However, Newcastle's valuation of the player, which is under  £30m, is nowhere near what it would take for Leeds to consider selling, and having lost Raphinha already this summer, offloading Harrison is not something they intend on doing. Elsewhere, the Magpies have also considered moves for Arsenal's Nicolas Pepe, Watford's Ismaila Sarr, Wolves' Adama Traore and Burnley duo Maxwel Cornet and Dwight McNeil as they look to bolster their right wing. But a new striker is also something that Eddie Howe is looking at and 90min understands that Everton's Dominic Calvert-Lewin remains their primary target. Everton sold Richarlison earlier this summer, but the belief is that the Toffees still need to bring money in and there is a feeling at St James' Park that remaining patient in their pursuit of the 25-year-old could well be worth it. Former striker Ivan Toney is a player of interest but 90min been told that Brentford have no intention of allowing him to leave the club this year, whilst Newcastle's interest in Brazilian Gabriel Barbosa - Gabigol - remains, but has not pushed on this summer.
