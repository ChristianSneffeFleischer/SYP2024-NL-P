Wilfried Zaha's Crystal Palace contract has now formally expired and the Ivorian is yet to decide on his next move, 90min understands. The 30-year-old, who came through the Palace academy and has spent all but 12 months of his career representing the Eagles, is now a free agent and has attracted interest from across the globe. Palace made an offer to Zaha in May which would see the Ivory Coast winger become the highest-paid player in their history and, although unsigned, 90min understands the proposal remains on the table. The Eagles are keen to retain Zaha, who has previously stressed his desire to play Champions League football. He does have the opportunity to play in Europe's top competition next season. Marseille and Lazio, of Ligue 1 and Serie A respectively, have both lodged offers to Zaha and can offer the European football he craves. feed However, Zaha has also been offered the chance to collect an enormous wage in Saudi Arabia. Thus far, Zaha has dismissed the advances from the Middle East but, like the contract from Palace, the offer has not yet been formally rejected or withdrawn and remains an option for the 30-year-old forward. There has previously been interest in Zaha from a number of the sides towards the top of the Premier League - Chelsea and Arsenal are known to have tracked the Ivorian in the past - but none have come forward with offers this summer. Zaha's decision to allow his Palace contract to expire will have a knock-on effect on former employers Manchester United, who negotiated a 25% sell-on clause when they sold the winger back in 2015.
