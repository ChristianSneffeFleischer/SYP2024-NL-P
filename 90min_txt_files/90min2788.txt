Benfica striker Goncalo Ramos has attracted plenty of interest from the Premier League, 90min can confirm. The highly rated 21-year-old managed seven goals in 29 league outings for Benfica last season and has enjoyed a hot start to the current campaign, netting three goals in two Champions League play-off games before chipping in with two assists in his side's league opener against Arouca in an attempt to fill the void left behind following Darwin Nunez's move to Liverpool. Sources have confirmed to 90min that Ramos could have the chance to follow Nunez to England as a number of Premier League sides have voiced an interest in signing him. Newcastle and Nottingham Forest have both held talks over a possible deal, but a number of clubs have asked to be kept aware of his availability - Crystal Palace, Everton, Leeds, West Ham and Wolves are all monitoring his situation. Ligue 1 champions Paris Saint-Germain are also keen as part of their search for a new striker which has also seen them express an interest in Manchester United's Marcus Rashford.
