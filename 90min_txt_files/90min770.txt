Chelsea have announced the long-awaited signing of Christopher Nkunku from RB Leipzig. The Blues first reached an agreement for the France international shortly after the closure of the summer 2022 transfer window. Nkunku finished the 2022/23 season at Leipzig, helping them to a top-four finish and glory in the DFB-Pokal, and he has now completed his move to west London on a six-year contract. In a statement, Nkunku said: "I am incredibly happy to be joining Chelsea. A big effort was made to bring me to the club and I am looking forward to meeting my new coach and teammates and showing the Chelsea supporters what I can do on the pitch.   "Having played in Ligue 1 and the Bundesliga, I now want to play in the Premier League, one of the strongest leagues in the world. I am very excited for this challenge and will be proud to wear the Chelsea shirt." Nkunku becomes the first official signing of the Mauricio Pochettino era. The 25-year-old battled injuries during the 2022/23 season but still managed to make a huge impact in his final year at Leipzig, registering 23 goals and nine assists in 36 games across all competitions.
