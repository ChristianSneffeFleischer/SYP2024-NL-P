Nottingham Forest have completed the signing of Chris Wood on an initial loan from Newcastle, which includes a conditional obligation to make it permanent until the summer of 2024. Wood was a  Â£25m signing for Newcastle last January, one of the first new arrivals following the PIF takeover. But he found himself on the fringes in the first half of this season, scoring only twice in the Premier League and making most of his appearances as a substitute. The New Zealand international will wear the number 39 shirt for Forest and provides a much-needed boost up front following injury to Taiwo Awoniyi.    Nottingham Forest is a massive club which I have come up against a number of times, but it   s nice now to be able to pull on the red shirt and fight for the club,    Wood said.
