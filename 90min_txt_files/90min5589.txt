Chelsea new boy Thiago Silva has pinpointed Frank Lampard as one of the main reasons he decided to join the Blues. After eight years with Paris Saint-Germain the 36-year-old swapped Parc des Princes for Stamford Bridge earlier this summer, despite the French champions insisting they were keen to keep hold of the Brazil international. Silva is rumoured to have attracted a number of potential suitors before opting to sign for Chelsea, though he claims the attraction of playing under a footballing great is what made him decide to move to the capital.    If it wasn   t for him, if he didn   t believe in me, I wouldn   t be here,    Silva told BBC Sport.    I certainly feel privileged to be part of a new family and to be coached by one of the best players in the world.    Silva isn   t the only marquee arrival at Stamford Bridge this summer, with the club splashing out upwards of  Â£200m as they attempt to bridge the gap between themselves and Premier League champions Liverpool. The Brazilian went on to add that he was excited to be a part of such an ambitious club, and he afforded a wry smile as he recalled an international fixture he took part in back in 2013 where he played against his new boss.
