Eintracht Frankfurt CEO Axel Hellmann has revealed that they were offered the chance to sign Cristiano Ronaldo a few months ago. While still contracted to Manchester United during the summer, Ronaldo sought an exit from Old Trafford. He received a huge offer from Saudi Arabia, but preferred to stay in Europe and pursue Champions League football despite a lack of suitors. One side tentatively linked with Ronaldo were Frankfurt, who were entering their first season in Europe's premier club competition after winning last season's Europa League. In an interview with DAZN, Hellmann has confirmed that Frankfurt were indeed approached about a possible deal for Ronaldo, but felt they were not the only ones. "[Ronaldo] was even offered to us," he said. "I have the feeling he was offered to every Champions League club."
