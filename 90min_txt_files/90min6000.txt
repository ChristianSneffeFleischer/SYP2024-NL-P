Matty Longstaff has put pen to paper on a new two-year deal with Newcastle, ending speculation the midfielder could move away from St James' Park. The academy product enjoyed a breakthrough season with his boyhood club during the 2019/20 campaign - but his current Newcastle deal was set to expire at the end of the season, leading to rumours that he could depart the club. ? He's here to stay!#NUFC are delighted to confirm that @mattylobby48 has signed a new deal with the club.              However, Newcastle announced on their club website that Longstaff had agreed to sign a new two-year deal and extend his stay at St James' Park. "I'm delighted to have signed," the midfielder said. "It took a bit longer than I'd hoped but I'm really happy it's done now, and I can't wait to get back to playing at a full St. James' Park hopefully soon. "I spoke to Steve Bruce and we talked through it and it was a no-brainer after I spoke to him. He gave me my chance and I'm really looking forward to working with him and his coaching staff, who were all great with me." Longstaff shot to fame after netting a screamer on his Magpies debut against Manchester United, before conducting the most wholesome post match interview ever with his older brother and teammate Sean. "Playing alongside Sean always makes it special so hopefully I can get a few more games under my belt with him and crack on," the 20-year-old added. Longstaff made 15 appearances during the 2019/20 season, scoring three goals. His form attracted interest from Udinese, Leeds and Brighton, but he eventually opted to commit his future to Newcastle - much to the delight of manager Steve Bruce.
