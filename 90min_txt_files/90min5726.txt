Juventus have set their asking price for Aaron Ramsey, with the Serie A giants willing to accept bids of between    25-30m ( £23-27m) for the midfielder. Ramsey has been deemed surplus to requirements at La Vecchia Signora as they look to offload some of their high earners in a bid to free up space on their payroll. Both Blaise Matuidi and Gonzalo Higuain were told earlier this summer they were free to leave the club, with the latter looking set to join Matuidi at David Beckham   s Inter Miami. With new Old Lady boss Andrea Pirlo keen to generate cash and embark on a complete squad overhaul, Calciomercato claim that I Bianconeri would be willing to entertain offers upwards of  £23m. Having arrived on a free transfer from Arsenal last summer, Ramsey endured a frustrating first season in Turin - going on to make just 11 starts in Serie A - and the club   s hierarchy appear to have lost patience with their  £400,000-a-week midfielder. Ramsey   s availability is understood to have alerted the attention of a whole host of Premier League clubs, with West Ham, Crystal Palace and Newcastle all said to be keen on securing the 29-year-old   s services. Hammers boss David Moyes will be keen to bolster his midfield options this summer with the injury-prone Jack Wilshere rumoured to be heading out of the club, and a long-term successor to 33-year-old Mark Noble required.
