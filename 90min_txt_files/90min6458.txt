Real Sociedad are eager to bring in Japanese sensation Takefusa Kubo on loan next season, with Real Madrid intrigued by the possibility.  Kubo joined Los Blancos from FC Tokyo on a free transfer last summer and has impressed out on loan at La Liga relegation-battlers Mallorca this term, making six goal contributions in 29 appearances.  Real's initial plan for Kubo was for him to play with their reserve squad - Castilla - but they changed their minds and instead sent him on loan to the Balearics. And Kubo's expected to have plenty of suitors when he returns from his current temporary spell. In fact, AS understand at least 29 clubs have taken an interested in acquiring the 19-year-old on loan next season. Paris Saint-Germain, meanwhile, are determined to sign him permanently, although Real have already explained they won't sell him under any conditions.  AS have also reported that Sociedad's offer is the one that appeals to Los Blancos the most at this point. Madrid are keen  to move him on to the next stage of development and to a team fighting for European football.  A slump in form since the restart, however, has left La Real in seventh and seven points adrift of the top four.  Nevertheless, the two clubs are said to have an excellent relationship and following Martin Odegaard's success in San Sebastian this term, Real believe Sociedad would be a great fit for Kubo - with their progressive playing style ideal for the Japanese youngster's development.
