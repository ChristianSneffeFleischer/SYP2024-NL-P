Manchester United hope to present new signing Rasmus Hojlund to fans in attendance at Old Trafford during Saturday's friendly against Lens, 90min understands. United have agreed a deal which could be worth up to  Â£72m to sign 20-year-old Hojlund, who has already passed his medical in Manchester and is understood to have signed his contract - a five-year deal with the option for a sixth. Plans to announce Hojlund's signing earlier this week were derailed as the striker's trip to Manchester was delayed and so United have been forced to reschedule their unveiling. Sources have confirmed to 90min that United are looking to publicise their signing of Hojlund around the time of Saturday's pre-season friendly against Lens at Old Trafford. The game kicks off at 12:45, with Hojlund expected to be in attendance. feed It will be the first time United have played at Old Trafford this summer and so home fans will also get their first glimpses of fellow new signings Mason Mount and Andre Onana, who joined earlier this summer from Chelsea and Inter respectively. Results have been mixed for Erik ten Hag's side this summer. After kicking off pre-season with victories over Leeds, Lyon and Arsenal, United have lost three on the bounce against Wrexham, Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund. Ten Hag labelled United's performance against Dortmund "unforgivable" and will demand more from his side in front of their home fans against Lens. United are also due in Dublin's Aviva Stadium on Sunday for one final friendly against Athletic Club.
