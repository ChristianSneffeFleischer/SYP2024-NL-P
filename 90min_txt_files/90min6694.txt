Turkish Super Lig side Goztepe want to sign Leicester's Daniel Amartey on loan, with the versatile midfielder said to be 'warm' to the prospect. Amartey joined the Foxes in January 2016, featuring in five Premier League games as the Foxes won the title, but has struggled to make an impact at King Power Stadium.  Injuries have slowed the Ghana international's progress and his last appearance for the club came in a 1-1 draw with West Ham all the way back in October 2018. He also remains firmly behind players like Wilfred Ndidi, James Maddison and Youri Tielemans in the pecking order for a starting spot under Brendan Rodgers, so news of a potential exit is not exactly surprisingly. Fotomac say Goztepe are interested in a loan deal, with a permanent purchase not currently on the cards and add that Amartey is keen to make the move, with his lack of game time likely to be a chief reason. The report also adds that talks over a permanent move could take place in the future. While Amartey was more of a fringe player during his first half-season at King Power, he featured more regularly during the 2016/17 term following the departure of N'Golo Kante to Chelsea. The 25-year-old made 24 Premier League appearances that season, also featuring eight times in the Champions League as the Foxes reached the quarter finals.
