After an 11-year stay in the top flight, Southampton were relegated after a defeat to Fulham on Saturday. It's been a disastrous season for the Saints and a season in which the club looked doomed for relegation since the very first game - a 4-1 defeat at Tottenham. Despite their poor performances, there is a surprising amount of quality on the books at St. Mary's Stadium at the moment. Here's the pick of the bunch and which Premier League clubs should snap them up in the summer. feed Clubs that should be interested: Aston Villa, Tottenham HotspurThe Saints' captain, for his set pieces alone, would be a valuable addition to any Premier League club. And when you add in the fact that he's quite a good player in open play too, Ward-Prowse could be a clever signing for a team eyeing up a top six finish next season.  Clubs that should be interested: Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United, Tottenham HotspurPerhaps the standout talent on Southampton's books, 19-year-old Romeo Lavia has everything it takes to become a genuinely world class midfielder. The youngster should be set for a move to one of the better teams in the Premier League during the summer.  Clubs that should be interested: West Ham, Fulham, Crystal PalaceSouthampton's -35 goal difference and their 66 goals conceded in 36 games may deter quite a few clubs from looking at the defenders on the books at St. Mary's, but in doing so some clubs will be overlooking a very talented young centre-back. Bella-Kotchap largely struggled during the 2022/23 season as the leader of the Southampton backline, but alongside a veteran centre-back at another club we could see a much, much improved player. At just 21 years old, he's worth taking a punt on this summer.
