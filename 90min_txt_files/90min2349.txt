A number of Liverpool   s Premier League rivals are keeping close tabs on Naby Keita   s contract talks as they entertain the idea of taking him on a free transfer at the end of the season, 90min understands. The midfielder has not actually played this season due to a series of niggling injuries, which has been a huge frustration for Liverpool and Jurgen Klopp given the Guinean's form last season and their other medical woes. Keita was outstanding for the Reds last term, especially towards the end of the season with many tipping him to start the Champions League final against Real Madrid. However, Jordan Henderson and Thiago were picked ahead of him. During the summer, Keita   s agents made a concerted push for Liverpool to tie him down to a new deal before the transfer window closed, but when it became clear this wasn't going to happen, it was made known that he wasn't happy with the situation. The situation remains  deadlocked, and Keita   s camp know that interest in his services is strong both from within the Premier League and abroad despite his injury record. The chance to land Keita on a free is hugely appealing and 90min understands that Chelsea, Arsenal and Tottenham are among those contemplating an offer. Chelsea could consider moving on from the likes of N'Golo Kante and Jorginho while Denis Zakaria does not have a long-term future at the club, and the chance to bolster their ranks with a free agent is believed to appeal to the Blues.
