Leicester City have reached an agreement with Real Betis midfielder William Carvalho over a summer a transfer, but the Foxes are still yet to agree a fee with his club, according to a report in Spain.  Carvalho has struggled with injuries in 2019/20, making just nine appearances in all competitions for Betis.  The coronavirus-enforced break provided the 28-year-old with the chance to overcome his injury struggles and play some part in his side's season run-in, but he has been left on the bench for two of their three matches since the restart, while he missed the other game through illness.  The Portugal international has been linked with a move to the Premier League for a number of seasons, but more recently, it is Leicester who have shown an interest as they look to strengthen the base of their midfield.  Radio Marca Sevilla (via MARCA) report that the Foxes have reached an agreement with Carvalho over a transfer at the end of the 2019/20 season, but while they are ready to make a 'significant financial effort' to sign the player, a fee is yet to be agreed with Betis.  Despite this, it is said that all parties welcome the move, and Betis have already accepted they will lose Carvalho. It has previously been reported that in order for Leicester to land their target, they would have to part ways with    20m ( Â£17.5m).
