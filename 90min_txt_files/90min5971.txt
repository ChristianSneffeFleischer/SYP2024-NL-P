Atletico Madrid right-back Kieran Trippier is reportedly a transfer target for Aston Villa this summer as Dean Smith looks to improve his defensive options for 2020/21. According to The Telegraph, Aston Villa have made the right-back an 'ambitious target', with the possibility of either a loan or permanent move on the cards. Aston Villa keen to sign Kieran Trippier from Atletico Madrid to bolster defence | @mcgrathmike https://t.co/uU3BgbCwF6 Trippier only joined the Spanish side last summer following a  Â£20m move from Tottenham and has since relocated his family in the Spanish capital. The Englishman made 25 appearances in La Liga for Diego Simeone's side, providing four assists for his teammates in the process. Trippier has also made six UEFA Champions League appearances in 2019/20. The 29-year-old has largely competed with Santiago Arias for Simeone's right-back spot, while Atleti also have Croatian Sime Vrasljko in the same position. For his part, Trippier has previously indicated that he would only return to the Premier League if he were to sign for his former side Burnley.  Speaking to the Burnley Express, he said: "That's my aim, to retire at Burnley. I have a great relationship with Sean Dyche. "I want to play as high as I can for as long as I can, but I'll know when the time is right. If I'm at Atleti for another two years that'll take me to 32 and Burnley's the only club that I'd come back to England for. "That's the way I want it to plan out. I want to play here for as long as I can and then finish playing for a manager like Sean Dyche while ending my career at Burnley. That's where I want to finish."
