Bournemouth are in talks with Roma over the possibility of signing Matias Vina, sources have told 90min. The Cherries were recently the subject of a takeover by Bill Foley and Black Knight Football Club - a partnership which includes renowned actor Michael B. Jordan. They are looking to bring in reinforcements to help in their fight against relegation, and a deal to sign Villarreal forward Nicolas Jackson from under the noses of Southampton is edging closer. 90min understands that they are now trying to complete a deal for left-back Vina, who has struggled for minutes with Roma this season. He was part of Uruguay's squad for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar and could be handed more first-team football with a move to Bournemouth. La Liga side Real Mallorca are also vying for his signature. Bournemouth had previously been interested in potentially bringing Arnaut Danjuma back to the Vitality Stadium from Villarreal following a previous two-year spell on the south coast. He had appeared to be joining Everton, but is now heading to Tottenham after a last minute change of heart. Gary O'Neil's side are currently 18th in the Premier League table and are only two points clear of rock-bottom Southampton.
