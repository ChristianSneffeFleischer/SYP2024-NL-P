Porto have confirmed the signing of Chelsea defender Malang Sarr on a season-long loan.  Sarr arrived at Stamford Bridge as a free agent this summer after spending the entirety of his senior career at Nice following his breakthrough into the first team in 2016.  The Blues announced after the Frenchman's arrival on a five-year deal at the end of August that he would be spending the 2020/21 campaign out on loan - in typical Chelsea style - with club director Marina Granovskaia saying: "He is a tremendous prospect and we will be monitoring him closely during his loan period, hoping he will soon be back at Chelsea."  The Blues will be monitoring his progress over in Portugal after the club agreed a temporary deal with Porto for Sarr's services, with the Portuguese club confirming the 21-year-old's signing on their official Twitter page.  The versatile Frenchman joined Chelsea off the back of a rather disappointing end to his Nice career as his individual performances stagnated. He was in need of a fresh environment, with his impressive skill set laid bare after he emerged onto the senior scene as a teenager.  Sarr's a fine ball-player capable of delivering dreamy diagonals to the opposite flank with his stronger left foot. However, it'll be interesting to see how Porto deploy the Frenchman after the exit of left-back Alex Telles.  ?    Bem-vindo, Malang Sarr?   Bienvenu, Malang Sarr?
