La Liga side Valencia are keeping tabs on Tottenham midfielder Harry Winks, with a potential loan move in the offing. The England man became a regular in the Spurs midfield during Mauricio Pochettino's time at the club, a position he retained following the arrival of Jose Mourinho in November 2019. However, the signing of Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg from Southampton last summer has seen Winks' time in the starting XI limited, with the 24-year-old being afforded just five Premier League starts so far this campaign. The Daily Mail report that Valencia are monitoring the out-of-favour Spurs midfielder as they look to bolster their squad in a bid to avoid relegation from La Liga.   Javi Gracia's side sit just three points above the drop zone, and the former Watford manager - who is a 'huge admirer' of Winks from his time in the Premier League - has pinpointed the Spurs midfielder as a January transfer target. Valencia find themselves in the midst of a financial crisis, with many of their stars mooted to be set to depart the Mestalla as the club looks to generate transfer funds. Subsequently, a permanent move for Winks appears to be out of the question, though the Spanish side are hopeful a loan deal can be agreed before the end of the transfer window. Spurs are already understood to have rebuffed one loan enquiry from Los Che, though a second offer is likely to be tabled in the near future.
