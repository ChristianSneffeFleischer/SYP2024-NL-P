Villarreal manager Unai Emery has revealed that defender Juan Foyth wants to stay at the club, despite interest from Barcelona. Foyth is on Barcelona's shortlist for possible right-back reinforcements and Emery has already publicly pleaded with those in charge at Villarreal to reject any interest in the 24-year-old Argentina international. Emery maintained that stance on Cadena SER's El Larguero, stressing that Foyth's focus is solely on Villarreal. "[Right-back] is a position that Barcelona need and he fits them," Emery said. "The issue is whether the player wants it or not. "He has always told me that he is very happy. He does not contemplate leaving and wants to stay." However, Emery did concede that he cannot definitely rule out a transfer, although he insisted that he is not concerned by the situation. He added: "I can't rule out his departure. But normally, he would stay."

Barcelona manager Xavi has publicly admitted he wants to strengthen at right-back.

While the search has been going on, Xavi has made it abundantly clear that the only natural right-back in his squad, Sergino Dest, does not have a future at Camp Nou.
