Paris Saint Germain are increasingly confident of signing Milan Skriniar from Inter after he rejected their latest contract offer, sources have confirmed to 90min. The 27-year-old is believed to have knocked back Inter's latest proposal earlier this week, insisting that he wants to continue assessing his options. Skriniar's current deal at San Siro expires at the end of the season, meaning he is now free to talk terms with other clubs. PSG, who came close to landing Skriniar last summer, have always maintained an interest in signing the Slovakian international, and have wasted little time in making him an offer which sources believe is worth over  Â£200,000-per-week. Listen now as  Scott Saunders  hosts  Graeme Bailey  and  Toby Cudworth  in the latest episode of Talking Transfers. This week's agenda includes Jude Bellingham, Harry Kane, Declan Rice, Hakim Ziyech, Leandro Trossard, Pedro Porro, Mykhaylo Mudryk and more!
