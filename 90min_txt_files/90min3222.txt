Paris Saint-Germain's Qatari owners are unsure whether selling Neymar before the World Cup is the right thing to do, 90min understands. The 30-year-old signed a new contract at the Parc des Princes last year, earning an estimated    43m annually with bonuses, and is committed to the club until 2027 after a clause was triggered to extend the deal. Despite that, 90min has learned the club's footballing hierarchy are prepared to entertain the prospect of Neymar leaving, with Kylian Mbappe taking a lead role in the French capital after turning down the advances of Real Madrid. Indeed, club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi recently refused to confirm that Neymar would be staying in Paris beyond this summer, warning that PSG's 'bling-bling' players may be let go. However, sources have told 90min that PSG's Qatari ownership are not convinced that letting Neymar leave before the 2022 World Cup is necessarily the right thing to do, and wish to evaluate the situation fully before making a decision. In the meantime, 90min understands that intermediaries have briefed Premier League quartet Manchester United, Manchester City, Chelsea and Newcastle United about Neymar's potential availability in order to gauge their interest. Bayern Munich, Juventus and Milan have also been contacted, but the pot of clubs who could feasibly afford Neymar's wages doesn't extend much further than that. Listen now to 90min's Talking Transfers podcast, with  Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey,  Harry Symeou  &  Toby Cudworth. On the latest show they discuss Richarlison's impending move to Tottenham, where Lisandro Martinez could be heading and more. Available on  all audio platforms  and the  90min YouTube channel.
