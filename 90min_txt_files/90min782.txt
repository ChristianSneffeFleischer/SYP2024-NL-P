Pep Guardiola has admitted he is prepared to fight to keep Ilkay Gundogan at Manchester City beyond this season. Gundogan's current contract at City is due to expire at the end of June following a historic season for both the player and the club, but Barcelona have made an offer to the 32-year-old to try and lure him to Camp Nou. Guardiola recently revealed that sporting director Txiki Begiristain is working on a new deal for the player but, despite their best efforts, 90min understands that Barcelona have long been confident of securing his services this summer. Barcelona have offered Gundogan a two-year deal at Camp Nou, with an option for a further year. Sources have also confirmed that the player's family are keen to live in Spain. Nevertheless, Guardiola is not prepared to accept defeat just yet and vowed to put up a fight to stop the City captain from leaving. feed "We are interested in renewing his contract and [Barcelona] are also interested," Guardiola said at the Puma Legends golf tournament. "I hope he stays with us. We are still fighting for him to stay with us. He is a player we want to stay, and we will do all we can, but we know Barca want him. "If Bar  a sign him, they will have a spectacular footballer on their hands. I am aware Xavi has called him a lot. If, in the end, he picks Barca, I will tell him he will enjoy himself." Gundogan is one of a number of City players linked with a move away from the Etihad Stadium this summer, with Bernardo Silva also looking to leave the club this summer. Barcelona are keen on the Portugal international but may have to fend off interest from Paris Saint-Germain.
