No, it's still not just a bad dream, Manchester City fans. David Silva has agreed terms on a three-year deal with Italian side Lazio. Silva signed for City in 2010 at the start of their ascent up the football ladder and has become a club legend over the last decade, with many touting him as their greatest player ever. The Spaniard, now 34, announced at the beginning of the 2019/20 season that he would leave the club following the end of the campaign. And while a global pandemic has delayed it for a short while, his departure is now imminent. A post shared by David Silva (@david21lva) on Aug 7, 2020 at 2:53pm PDT The Guardian report that Silva has agreed personal terms with Lazio after being assured he will be a first team player with the Serie A side. Silva believes he still has five years left at the top should injuries not interfere, and has agreed to the three-year contract following assurances over playing time. Silva was set to have already left by now, but the ongoing global pandemic means that City are still yet to complete their season. They beat Real Madrid over two legs to book their place in the makeshift Champions League knockout stages and face Lyon in the quarter final on Saturday.  Silva could still play a part in a potential Champions League triumph for the Citizens, while the move to Lazio continues to be finalised. With the tournament being held in Portugal, however, Silva has already played his last game at the Etihad Stadium.
