Rafaela Pimenta has sensationally tipped Erling Haaland to become the first player to yield a transfer fee close to  £1bn. Haaland joined Manchester City from Borussia Dortmund in a deal worth in excess of  £50m over the summer and has already racked up 20 goals for his new club. The rampant start to life at City has taken fans by surprise despite his prolific history at Dortmund and previous clubs, with many suggesting he would need to adjust to the style of City and English football. At just 22 years old, Haaland looks set for an all-time great career with an ability that appears to have no ceiling as of yet. His seamless transition to Premier League football has only increased his stock and further proven his immense talent, which Pimenta believes makes him a major commodity. Speaking to Sky Sports, she made a lofty prediction: "If you put together his [Haaland's] football value, his image value, his sponsor value, it is for sure one billion. "And if you compare also with that, it's normal to compare Erling with [Kylian] Mbappe, so you have a little bit of an idea of the market.  "I think Erling will be the first player to achieve a transfer that will be around  £1bn." The Norwegian is already being constantly compared to Paris Saint-Germain star Mbappe, who completed a  £165.7m transfer to the club in 2018, following a season-long loan. The Frenchman also infamously signed one of the largest contracts in sporting history over the summer, penning an extension with Les Parisiens that makes him one of the highest paid athletes ever.
