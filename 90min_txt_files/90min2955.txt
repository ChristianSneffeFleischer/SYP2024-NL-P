Newcastle United have been offered a host of high-profile forward players in recent weeks, 90min understands, including Timo Werner, Memphis Depay and Nicolas Pepe. The Magpies have welcomed goalkeeper Nick Pope, centre-back Sven Botman and left-back Matt Targett, who spent last season on loan in the North East, to St James' Park so far this summer - but have ambitions of strengthening Eddie Howe's attacking arsenal. Ideally the club would like to sign a wide forward and a striker, though Newcastle's ability to spend big is hampered somewhat by the need to comply with Financial Fair Play regulations. Nevertheless, a number of players have been offered to the club by agents and intermediaries in recent weeks, with Newcastle currently considering the options that have been forward to them. Listen now to 90min's Talking Transfers podcast, with  Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey,  Harry Symeou  &  Toby Cudworth.
