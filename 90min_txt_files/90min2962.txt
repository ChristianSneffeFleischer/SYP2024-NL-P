Atletico Madrid president Enrique Cerezo has denied reports that the club are sounding out a move for Cristiano Ronaldo this summer. Los Rojiblancos had been linked with a loan for the Real Madrid legend, though Atletico fans started a social media campaign speaking out against such a deal. Frenkie de Jong has accepted that he may have to leave Barcelona this summer despite wanting to stay at Camp Nou.

Neither Arsenal or Manchester United have not made an approach to sign Leicester City midfielder Youri Tielemans this summer, according to Foxes chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha. The Belgium international has one year remaining on his deal at the King Power Stadium. Bayern Munich CEO Oliver Kahn has admitted his admiration of Tottenham striker Harry Kane, but refused to discuss a potential move for the England captain. Newcastle United have joined Juventus in the race to sign Timo Werner. Chelsea are open to offers for the German forward, though at present Juve would only be able to afford a loan, whereas the Magpies could try and sign him outright. Juventus are also prioritising bringing Alvaro Morata back to the Allianz Stadium, while Memphis Depay and Anthony Martial are on their shortlist. Real Madrid have not received any offers for Marco Asensio so far this summer and he is likely to leave on a free transfer when his contract expires next year instead.
