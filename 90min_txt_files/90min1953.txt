Napoli have made an offer to sign Morocco World Cup star Azzedine Ounahi, sources have told 90min. The midfielder played a pivotal role in the Atlas Lions' historic run to the semi-finals this winter, and he has been heavily linked with a move away from Ligue 1 side Angers as a result. 90min reported last week that Leicester City had made a    28m offer for Ounahi, but this is roughly    12m short of Angers' asking price. A further sticking point is that Angers would like any deal for Ounahi to allow them to keep him for the rest of the season - they are currently mired in a relegation battle, sitting bottom of the Ligue 1 table seven points adrift from safety.
