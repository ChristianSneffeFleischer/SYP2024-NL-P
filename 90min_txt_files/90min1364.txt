But the Blues are confident they are close to agreeing an extension.

Due to the time remaining on his current deal, however, Kante is free to speak with clubs from across Europe over a possible free transfer and sources have confirmed to 90min that PSG have not yet given up hope of convincing the midfielder to leave Stamford Bridge. The Ligue 1 giants have stayed in touch with Kante's representatives but, despite the pressure from PSG, Chelsea remain confident that they will finalise an extension for the 2018 World Cup winner in the near future, in a huge boost to manager Graham Potter.
