Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has confirmed that a decision on Amad Diallo's immediate future will be taken before the January transfer window opens. Amad had been expected to join Feyenoord on loan in the summer, only for a nasty thigh injury to force the Dutch side to pull out, and the 19-year-old has only recently returned to basic training at Carrington. Given United's flaws in attack this season, there could be a spot for Amad in Solskjaer's squad, and the boss revealed that a final decision on the teenager's future is yet to be made. "Amad trained his first session last week before Leicester," Solskjaer said (via Manchester Evening News). "He's still continuing his rehab and will probably play in the Under-23s when he is ready for that. "His development has been exactly what we wanted from him, learning the language. We have to make the decision before Christmas whether he is going to play here or elsewhere. The injury was bad timing." Feyenoord have been tipped to reignite their interest in Amad in the January transfer window, although they did add Arsenal's Reiss Nelson late in the summer and may no longer have the need for another winger. Fortunately, if the decision is made to send Amad out on loan, there shouldn't be too many problems finding a suitor for a player who is widely accepted to be one of the finest young talents on the planet. A loan move appears to make the most sense for Amad, who would not be Solskjaer's first choice for minutes on the right wing.
