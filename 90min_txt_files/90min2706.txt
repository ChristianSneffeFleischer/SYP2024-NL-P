Leeds United are in talks with FC Zurich over a deal for teenage Italian international forward Wilfried Gnonto, 90min understands. The Whites have been looking to sign at least one new forward to bolster their options, but recently missed out on prime target Arnaud Kalimuendo - who opted to leave Ligue 1 champions Paris Saint-Germain for Rennes. Leeds have been scouring Europe in a bid to identify other targets, and have now made a move for highly-rated Gnonto - who impressed with nine goals for Zurich last season. The 18-year-old has just 12 months remaining on his contract in Switzerland and Zurich are ready to listen to offers. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  &  Toby Cudworth  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Erik ten Hag wanting to sign five players before the transfer window closes, and Man Utd's attitude to selling Cristiano Ronaldo. Available on  all audio platforms  and the  90min YouTube channel.
