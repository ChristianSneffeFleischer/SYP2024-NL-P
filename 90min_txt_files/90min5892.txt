Chelsea's transfer spending spree looks set to continue after the west Londoners made an improved bid of  £18m for Rennes goalkeeper Edouard Mendy.  The 28-year-old Senegal international only joined Rennes last summer but after playing an instrumental role in the club's third-place league finish - ensuring their first-ever participation in the Champions League - Mendy has attracted attention outside of France. Chelsea's current number one Kepa Arrizabalaga endured a confidence sapping end to the 2019/20 campaign as manager Frank Lampard repeatedly favoured 38-year-old Willy Caballero. Arrizabalaga was dropped for Chelsea's crucial final league game of the season against Wolverhampton Wanderers and the FA Cup final the following week.  Lampard's latest attempt to land a new goalkeeper has seen the Blues make an  £18m bid for Mendy, according to Goal. Chelsea's initial offer of  £15m last week was rejected by Rennes as per reports from The Sun.  Arrizabalaga - the world's most expensive goalkeeper - has come under heavy criticism in his second season at Chelsea, with many citing his woeful save percentage of 55%, the worst rate in the Premier League. Mendy, on the other hand, can point to a record of 78% in the same statistics in the last campaign, the third-best ratio in the French top flight.  Mendy is far from the first goalkeeper Lampard's side has been linked with this summer. Chelsea were rumoured to be plotting a move for Manchester United's much sought-after Dean Henderson, although such talk has died down after the 23-year-old signed a new five-year deal with the Red Devils.
