Chelsea winger Callum Hudson-Odoi will not be leaving the club this summer, bringing to an end speculation suggesting the Blues could swap the youngster for Bayern Munich's Kingsley Coman. The Bundesliga champions have made no secret of their admiration for Hudson-Odoi in recent years, with their original pursuit leading to the England international penning a new  Â£120,000-per-week contract at Stamford Bridge. Bayern have reignited their interest in the 20-year-old this summer, leading to rumours the Blues could look to thrash out a swap deal which would see Coman head to west London. However, The Sun now report that Hudson-Odoi has no intention of leaving Chelsea, meaning their interest in Coman has subsequently been brought to an end. Despite Hudson-Odoi evidently hoping to work his way into Thomas Tuchel's thinking, rumours of his possible departure came as no surprise given the youngster's inability to cement his place in the starting XI. Following Tuchel's arrival at Stamford Bridge in January, the winger seemed to be at the forefront of the German tactician's plans - making 13 appearances in his first two months at the club - though he would go on to feature for just 172 minutes in Chelsea's final 13 games of the season. Given his lack of first-team action towards the end of the 2020/21 campaign his mooted exit made perfect sense, but The Athletic report that Tuchel is desperate to give Hudson-Odoi another chance to prove his worth. In footage obtained from Chelsea's in-house cameras from the start of pre-season, Tuchel suggested the absence of players who were representing their country at Euro 2020 would benefit the winger as he could have more one-on-one time with the coaches, claiming:    This is very good for Callum Hudson-Odoi. No more hiding. Hiding is over.
