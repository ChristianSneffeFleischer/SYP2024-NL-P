Ruben Loftus-Cheek has admitted that a lack of game time at Chelsea led to his departure this summer. The towering midfielder ended his near 20-year association with Chelsea - having joined the youth team in 2004 - at the end of the 2022/23 season following the expiration of his contract at Stamford Bridge. Loftus-Cheek has signed a four-year deal with Milan, with the midfielder seemingly set to replace Sandro Tonali in Stefano Pioli's starting XI after he joined Newcastle United for an Italian record fee earlier this month.  feed Speaking to the press at his unveiling as a Milan player, Loftus-Cheek admitted that decided to leave the Blues due to the lack of playing time in his preferred position in midfield. "I love the club and the fans but I wasn't feeling content with the amount I was playing and the positions I was playing in," he said. "I felt I had more to give but I wasn't getting the opportunity. I feel good physically and am playing some really good football. It was a good time to move on." The 27-year-old made 25 appearances for Chelsea during the 2022/23 campaign, with just 11 of those coming as a central midfielder. Loftus-Cheek was more regularly utilised as a right wing-back, playing that position on 14 occasions.
