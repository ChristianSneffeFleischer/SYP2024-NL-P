Eric Dier has said that he sees himself leaving Tottenham to play abroad again at some point later in his career. The England international, who emigrated to Portugal aged seven, began his career with Sporting CP, who Spurs will face in the Champions League on Wednesday night. Dier completed a permanent move to Tottenham in 2014 and was one of the first signings of the Mauricio Pochettino era - only Hugo Lloris, Ben Davies and Harry Kane remain from the squad that he first joined. The 28-year-old is now just under two seasons away from being due a testimonial at Spurs, but speaking to The Times, Dier asserted that he would like to play on the continent again. "Who knows where football will take me in two or three years?" Dier said. "I   m still young, I   ve got a lot of time left. I   m looking after myself. I think I will play abroad again at some point in the future, but there   s no rush on that. I would really enjoy experiencing a different type of football again. I think it will happen at some point and I think I look forward to experiencing football in a different culture because I loved it as a kid as well." Scott Saunders  hosts  Graeme Bailey  and  Toby Cudworth  in the latest episode of Talking Transfers. The team discuss Cristiano Ronaldo's Man Utd future, interest in Naby Keita and a decision looming for Harry Kane. Available on  all audio platforms.

While Dier's future plans are now out in the open, those of head coach Antonio Conte aren't as concrete. 90min understands that Spurs want to discuss a new contract with the Italian - his current is up in 2023, though the club retain a one-year extension option - around the time of the World Cup break, but Juventus would like to bring him back to Turin.
