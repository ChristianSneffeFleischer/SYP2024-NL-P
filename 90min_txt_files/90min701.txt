Marcus Thuram has decided to join Inter instead of Milan this summer, sources have confirmed to 90min. The France international's contract at Borussia Monchengladbach is up at the end of June and he has been courted by sides from all over Europe in recent months. 90min reported in March that Newcastle United had held talks with his representatives over a free transfer to St James' Park, but a move never materialised. City rivals Inter and Milan have been competing for his signature over the last month, and the Rossoneri thought they had won the race when Thuram gave his word to a three-year contract. However, 90min understands that Thuram has had a change of heart and will now sign for Inter instead. feed The Nerazzurri see the 25-year-old as an ideal replacement for the outgoing Edin Dzeko, who has joined Fenerbahce. Meanwhile, Inter remain locked in talks with Chelsea over a fresh deal for Romelu Lukaku, who spent last season on loan at San Siro. Lukaku has an offer from the Saudi Pro League on the table but would prefer to rejoin Inter for a third spell instead. 90min reported on Friday that Inter are additionally hoping to sign another Chelsea player in Cesar Azpilicueta. Inter are also negotiating the sale of Marcelo Brozovic to Saudi side Al Nassr, though Barcelona have asked the Croatian midfielder to stall the deal as they are hoping to find the finances to put forward a package of their own in the near future.
