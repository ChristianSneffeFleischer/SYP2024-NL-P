Chelsea midfielder Conor Gallagher is set to swap west for south London as a loan move to Crystal Palace edges towards completion. According to football.london, the 20-year-old has already had a medical with the Eagles and will join Roy Hodgson's side for the 2020/21 campaign. Gallagher spent last season away from Chelsea on two loan spells after being awarded the club's Academy Player of the Year award in 2019.  The Englishman was then sent on loan to Charlton for the 2019/20 season, but was recalled by his parent club in January. The decision was then taken to send Gallagher on a new loan to Swansea City, a team further up the Sky Bet Championship table. During his initial loan spell at Charlton, Gallagher played 26 times, scoring six goals and assisting four. The midfielder couldn't find his goalscoring form with Swansea City, but registered seven assists in 19 Championship appearances as the Welsh side made the playoffs. The majority of the loanee's appearances at Swansea City saw him play in more advanced, attacking positions in midfield, which gave Gallagher the license to be creative in the final third. Charlton boss Lee Bowyer has since claimed losing the England Under-21 midfielder halfway through the season was a big loss for the club.  He said: "He   s been a massive loss, probably impossible to replace. "If you think what he brought us in that first half of the season. He brought us energy, fight, determination and goals.
