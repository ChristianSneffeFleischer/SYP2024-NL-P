Tottenham defender Davinson Sanchez is in talks with Sevilla over a move to the Spanish side if they find themselves needing to replace Chelsea target Jules Kounde. Spurs pursued a move for Kounde earlier in the window and saw Sevila accept a bid which included Sanchez as a makeweight, only for the highly rated Frenchman to reject the move over concerns he would not play Champions League football with Spurs. Since then, European champions Chelsea have opened talks with Kounde and are focused on getting a deal done, and it seems as though Sevilla could be preparing for his exit as Sanchez's agent has confirmed he is talking with the Spanish side over a possible transfer. "They are just rumours, yes I have spoken with the people of Seville, but at the moment they have the complete squad," Nestor Villarreal told Caracol Radio. "If there is a transfer on their part, those rumours could be true, but there is nothing specifically, only conversations." Sanchez's proposed move to Sevilla obviously hinges on Kounde's future, and that's where Chelsea come in. The Blues are expected to sign the 22-year-old, although there is still some distance between the two clubs in negotiations. The latest update on Chelsea's pursuit of Kounde comes from ABC Sevilla, who suggest that Sevilla's asking price of between  £50m and  £55m is proving to be a little too high for Chelsea as it stands. The Blues are looking to negotiate that price down and hope to use at least one player as a makeweight but, as first revealed by 90min, centre-back Kurt Zouma is keen to avoid being the casualty.
