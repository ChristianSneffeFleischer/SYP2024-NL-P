Barcelona have completed the full signing of Emerson Royal, having previously shared ownership of the player with Real Betis.  The right-back has spent the last two seasons on loan at Betis, impressing with his energetic displays. Overall he missed just seven La Liga games during his two campaigns at the club, scoring four goals and laying on an impressive 10 assists.  Last season he helped Manuel Pellegrini's side secure a top six finish, playing more minutes than anyone else in the squad.   Barcelona and Betis struck an agreement to bring him to Spain from Atletico Mineiro in 2019. Each club paid half of the transfer fee and retained some of his economic rights. Also included in the deal was a clause for Barcelona to own Emerson outright for    6m - an option they have now exercised.  He will add competition for places at right-back. Ronald Koeman tended to favour Sergino Dest in the position last season with Sergi Roberto spending the majority of the campaign injured.  ? Hello, @emerson_royal22!?       #EmersonCuler Barcelona are keen for Roberto to play a role next season, but they also want the Spaniard to agree to a wage cut. If a deal cannot be struck, he could be sold - with Manchester City linked with a move recently.
