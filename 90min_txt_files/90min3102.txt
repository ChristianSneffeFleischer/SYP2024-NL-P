Brentford have confirmed the signing of England Under-21 international Keane Lewis-Potter on a six-year deal.  The 21-year-old joins Brentford following a fantastic season at Hull City in which he scored 12 Championship goals and won the club's player of the year award. The Bees have seen off interest from West Ham - who had been keen to take him to London Stadium - to get the deal done, with a statement on his arrival reading: "We are delighted to announce the signing of Keane Lewis-Potter. "The 21-year-old attacker joins us from Sky Bet Championship side Hull City for an undisclosed fee. He [Lewis-Potter] has signed a six-year contract and there is a club option for an extra year. "Keane completed a medical late yesterday, Monday 11 July, and will link up with the group in Germany on a pre-season training camp shortly."

Thomas Frank expressed his delight at the signing, stating:    I am pleased that we have managed to sign one of the biggest young talents in the Championship. He had a very good season last year.
