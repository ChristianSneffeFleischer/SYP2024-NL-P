Real Valladolid right-back Ivan Fresneda has insisted he does not plan to leave the La Liga side this month. 90min revealed earlier this month Arsenal were in talks for Fresneda, who is also understood to have attracted significant interest from Borussia Dortmund during the winter transfer window. However, Arsenal's hopes of signing the 18-year-old appear to have been dashed by the player himself, who urged a group of Valladolid fans that he will not be leaving the club before the end of the month.    No man no, I   m not leaving, don   t worry," Fresneda told a group of fans while signing autographs outside the Valladolid training ground. Any pursuit of Fresneda from Arsenal was expected to include a return to Valladolid on loan for the remainder of the season, and it remains to be seen if the Gunners will be able to convince both the club and the player to do business.
