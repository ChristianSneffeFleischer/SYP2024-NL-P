Alexis Mac Allister's father has commented on Juventus' interest in his son, stating that they will analyse any offers that are received.  The Brighton star has been heavily linked with a move away from the Premier League club following his fantastic performances for Argentina at the FIFA World Cup. Having already started the club season well with the Seagulls in the Premier League, Mac Allister was instrumental in Argentina's triumph in Qatar, setting up Angel Di Maria's goal in the final and putting in a number of lung-bursting performances along the way. These displays have, as expected, alerted some of Europe's biggest clubs. 90min understands that two are Juventus and Atletico Madrid, who are both in the market for new central midfielder.  Juve are keen to replace Adrien Rabiot in the near future, with the player all set to leave this summer once his current contract ends. Rabiot has been offered to Barcelona and a number of Premier League clubs ahead of the expiry of his contract at the end of the season, 90min has reported. Speaking to TuttomercatoWEB now, Mac Allister's father and agent has acknowledged Juve interest.     Juventus are a great club, one of the most prestigious in the world. I can only say that together with the club we will analyse the offers that come to us, then we will decide what will happen in Alexis    future," he said.    He is very happy in England and he   s grateful to Brighton because they gave him the chance to reach Europe. We cannot give a price, though, nor do we say who called us. We don   t want to give information that could prejudice upcoming negotiations, if there are any.
