Bayern Munich head coach Thomas Tuchel has discussed the club's pursuit of Tottenham Hotspur striker Harry Kane. The Bavarians' interest in the England captain dates back to last summer when former boss Julian Nagelsmann revealed his admiration for Kane, but that a deal would be hard for the club to follow through with due to Spurs' likely demands. With Kane now into the final year of his contract, Bayern have firmed up their interest with two bids for him this transfer window, but twice have been knocked back by Tottenham. 90min reported earlier this week that the Bundesliga champions were readying a new club-record bid for Kane worth north of    80m, while Spurs chairman Daniel Levy has met with Bayern CEO Jan-Christian Dreesen in person. However, there remains no indication that Tottenham will budge and sanction a sale of Kane this summer. feed Speaking at his first press conference of pre-season, Tuchel was inevitably quizzed on Bayern's interest in Kane, and though he refused to talk at length about the 29-year-old, he revealed the club could go 'all in' for the right target.  "I have a very boring answer: I do not comment on players who are not with us," Tuchel began. "It's well known that we are looking for a number nine. If we find someone that fits in, then we'll go all in. If we don't find anyone, we're happy with our squad. But we need more patience." Kane has travelled with the Tottenham squad for their tour of Australia and Asia, with Hugo Lloris the only player omitted in order to finalise a move away. The club captain has already admitted that he wants to take on a new challenge elsewhere as Spurs embark on a new era under head coach Ange Postecoglou.
