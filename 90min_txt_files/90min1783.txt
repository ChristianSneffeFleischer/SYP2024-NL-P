Rangers have confirmed the signing of English attacking midfielder Todd Cantwell on a long-term contract. After a promising debut Premier League season in 2019/20 when he scored six goals, the 24-year-old has since struggled for regular football and spent the second half of last season on loan with Bournemouth. Cantwell won the Championship twice during his time with Norwich in 2019 and 2021. He made almost 130 appearances for the Canaries in total, scoring 14 goals. Cantwell told RangersTV:  "I am delighted and I feel very proud. This is obviously a massive football club and I am delighted to get going and to get started. "This is a massive club and there is a massive responsibility when you sign for Rangers to be the player that the fans want to see. "They want to see a player that works hard and a player that can win them games which is very important and that is something I am hoping I can bring." Manager Michael Beale added:     I am extremely happy to welcome Todd to Rangers. He is a player that is fully aligned to our playing style and we believe he will be a key player for the club in the coming seasons.
