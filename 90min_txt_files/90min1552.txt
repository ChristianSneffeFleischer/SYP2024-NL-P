Joao Cancelo has commented on reports which linked him with Real Madrid prior to his loan move to Bayern Munich at the end of the January transfer window. After falling out of favour at Manchester City following the World Cup, Cancelo was shipped out by Pep Guardiola, with Bayern taking him on loan with an option to buy. The deal happened very quickly over the course of a few days to the shock of Europe, with few other contenders emerging for Cancelo in such a short space of time. Reports from Spain have suggested Real Madrid were interested in a deal and could continue their pursuit in the summer, but Cancelo has revealed he has not received contact from Los Blancos. On this edition of Talking Transfers, part of the 90min podcast network, Scott Saunders, Graeme Bailey & Toby Cudworth discuss the Premier League's managerial merry-go-round with the latest on the situations at Leeds United and Southampton.

"I did not receive any proposal from Real Madrid in January, no...if rumours say so, I don   t know," Cancelo told Movistar. "If a club like Real Madrid wants you, it   s a pleasure. It also means I   m doing the right things."
