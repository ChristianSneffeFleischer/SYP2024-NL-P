Chelsea believe they have made significant progress in their negotiations with Benfica over midfielder Enzo Fernandez, 90min understands. The Blues tried to recruit Fernandez earlier in the window but angered Benfica with their pursuit, with manager Roger Schmidt labelling Chelsea's efforts 'disrespectful' before warning that the 22-year-old will only be sold if his    120m release clause is triggered. 90min reported on Sunday that Chelsea had reinitiated talks with Benfica of the World Cup's Young Player of the Tournament award winner, with the Blues prepared to improve their initial proposal. Chelsea are still exploring a deal which would allow them to pay in instalments, and privately, Benfica are understood to be prepared to accept a structured deal as long as it includes a significant up-front payment. During the latest round of negotiations, which are believed to be led by Chelsea co-owner Behdad Eghbali, the Blues have expressed a willingness to pay over    120m in a structured deal, but talks remain on over how that figure would be divided. The final decision on a sale will be left to Benfica president Rui Costa. Listen now as  Scott Saunders  hosts  Graeme Bailey  and  Toby Cudworth  to discuss the latest transfer news.
