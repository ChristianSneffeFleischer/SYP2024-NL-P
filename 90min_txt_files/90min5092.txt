Andrea Pirlo has moved to downplay rumours regarding Paulo Dybala's future at Juventus by underlining the forward's importance to the club. The Argentina international was reportedly nearing a move away from Turin over the summer, with both Manchester United and Tottenham mooted as potential destinations.  Despite a transfer failing to materialise, speculation surrounding the 27-year-old has refused to go away, with 90min understanding the Premier League's top six have all been alerted to his availability. Dybala has struggled to maintain a place in the Juve starting XI this season, with Pirlo affording him just five starts in Serie A. However, when asked if the former Palermo man was viewed as an important member of the team, the Bianconeri boss couldn't have been more definitive in his response. He said: "Absolutely. Champions like him are always fundamental in strong teams," Pirlo told reporters (via the Daily Mail). "I train all the players. Dybala is one of them. His behaviour is great." Dybala missed his side's 4-0 win over Parma in Serie A on Saturday through injury - a win which keeps Pirlo's men within touching distance of leaders Milan - though the Juve boss confirmed he hopes to have him available for selection soon. "Unfortunately, he's got this little injury, and he tried to force it, but he was worried he would hurt himself even more. We hope to have him back on Tuesday," he added.
