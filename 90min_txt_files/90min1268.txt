Barcelona head coach Xavi has been asked about star midfielder Gavi drawing interest from Chelsea. Reports in Spain claim that the Blues are ready to offer the 18-year-old a bumper contract this summer in an attempt to lure him to west London. Gavi's senior contract with Barcelona was rescinded by La Liga and Spanish courts due to the club's unstable situation. His current deal is set to expire in the summer and he will, in the eyes of the law, be allowed to leave on a free transfer, although whether he would want to is a different matter.

I think his future is here at the club." 90min reported last month that Gavi does not intend to leave Barcelona this summer and is intent on staying at Camp Nou.
