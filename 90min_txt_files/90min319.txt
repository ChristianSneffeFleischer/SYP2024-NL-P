Jordan Henderson was left out of Liverpool's matchday squad for their pre-season friendly against Karlsruher on Wednesday as he inches closer to leaving the club. Interest from Saudi Arabian side Al Ettifaq, who are currently managed by Reds legend Steven Gerrard, was registered before Liverpool set off for their pre-season tour of Germany and Henderson made it clear he would be willing to make the move. Despite the ongoing transfer talks, Jurgen Klopp opted to name Henderson in his squad for this summer's preparations, but the decision was made to keep the 33-year-old away from Wednesday's matchday group as talks behind the scenes ramped up. Al Ettifaq have been in talks with Liverpool over a fee, with the Reds begrudgingly prepared to listen to offers after Henderson voiced a desire to seal the move. As such, those negotiations are understood to be nearing a positive conclusion. Henderson has agreed to a three-year contract in Saudi Arabia and appears to be inching closer to a reunion with Gerrard. feed Henderson may not be the only Liverpool midfielder heading to Saudi Arabia this summer as Fabinho is nearing his own move to the Middle East. Fabinho was not included in the pre-season squad and instead remained behind to negotiate the finishing touches on a shock move to Saudi champions Al Ittihad, who have already signed Karim Benzema and N'Golo Kante this summer. The Brazilian's exit is close to being confirmed, with just the details of Al Ittihad's  Â£40m payment left to be arranged.
