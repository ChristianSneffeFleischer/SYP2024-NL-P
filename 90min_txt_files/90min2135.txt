Napoli are confident that Khvicha Kvaratskhelia and Kim Min-jae will sign new contracts with the club before the end of the season, but are likely to sell Victor Osimhen in the summer of 2023, 90min understands. Gli Azzurri have been one of the best teams in Europe so far this term, sitting eight points clear atop the Serie A table going into the World Cup break and securing a place in the last 16 of the Champions League. Napoli's rise has in part been down to the form of summer signings Kvaratskhelia,    10m from Dinamo Batumi, and Kim,    18m from Fenerbahce. Sources have told 90min that Napoli are confident they will be able to fend off immediate transfer interest in the duo and get them to sign improved contracts at the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona.
