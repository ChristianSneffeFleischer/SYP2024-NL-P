Liverpool have agreed to send young midfielder Fabio Carvalho on loan to RB Leipzig next season, 90min understands. The 20-year-old joined from Fulham last summer and managed 21 appearances across all competitions during his first season at Anfield. He was a regular feature in the squad to start the season but was afforded just 11 minutes of Premier League action from November onwards. A loan move for this season has been on the cards for a while now but, as 90min revealed in April, the idea of a permanent departure was firmly ruled out. Sources have confirmed that Liverpool have rejected a permanent offer from Leipzig but have agreed to a straight loan deal which does not include an option or obligation to buy for the German side. Liverpool want Carvalho back at the club ahead of the 2024/25 campaign and have ensured they remain in control of the former Fulham starlet's future. feed Liverpool officials are understood to have been keen to keep Carvalho for the upcoming pre-season to give manager Jurgen Klopp chance to make a decision on his immediate future, but the 20-year-old wanted to get his future resolved as soon as possible and is now set to head to Germany for the coming year. Deployed both as a midfielder and a left winger under Klopp, Carvalho has seen Liverpool strengthen in both positions since his arrival. Cody Gakpo and Darwin Nunez have added to the competition out wide, while Alexis Mac Allister has agreed to move to Anfield this summer to bolster in midfield. The Reds remain keen to add another fresh face in midfield. Nice's Khephren Thuram and Borussia Monchengladbach's Manu Kone have both been discussed, and interest remains in unsettled Bayern Munich youngster Ryan Gravenberch.
