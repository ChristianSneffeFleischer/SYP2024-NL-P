West Ham have agreed a  £30m fee with Brentford for Algerian winger Said Benrahma.  The 25-year-old lit up the Championship last season, registering 17 goals and nine assists for Thomas Frank's side. Ever since the Bees lost to Fulham in the 2020 playoff final, speculation has been rife over his future, with several Premier League clubs linked.  Arsenal, Aston Villa and Leeds United were all thought to be interested in the summer but West Ham have recently emerged as favourites to land the him. On Friday, 90min reported that the Hammers had submitted a  £17m bid for Benrahma, not including add-ons.  And it now seems that a  £30m deal has been agreed. According to The Athletic, that fee includes all add-ons, with personal terms still needing to be negotiated.  Benrahma started his career at Nice, enjoying a string of fruitful loan moves between 2013 and 2018 before being snapped up by Brentford. Since arriving in west London, he has been nothing short of sensational, and he will bring invention and flair to West Ham.  Welcome Benrahma     After a troubling start to the Premier League season, the Hammers picked up back-to-back wins against Wolves and Leicester before the international break. This fine form has relieved some of the discontent among the supporters, who had previously expressed their dismay about the club's performance on and off the pitch.
