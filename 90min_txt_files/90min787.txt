Real Madrid have confirmed the signing of Espanyol striker Joselu on a season-long loan. The 33-year-old, who spent three years in the Real Madrid academy between 2009 and 2012, netted 16 La Liga goals last season but was unable to save Espanyol from relegation to the second tier, setting up his departure. Having lost both Karim Benzema and Mariano Diaz on free transfers this summer, Real Madrid were in desperate need of a new striker and the club have now confirmed Joselu's switch to the Santiago Bernabeu. Joselu joins on a season-long loan which includes an option to buy. Reports in Spain put that purchase clause at around    1.5m. The striker managed two appearances for Real Madrid during his first stint with Los Blancos, scoring in both La Liga and the Copa del Rey, and he will now have the chance to add to that. feed Real Madrid remain keen to land a new starting striker as well as Joselu. Having already distanced themselves from Chelsea's Kai Havertz, interest was lodged in Harry Kane before Kylian Mbappe found himself in dispute with Paris Saint-Germain. Mbappe will not trigger the extension option in his contract, which now expires in 2024. While Real are keen to land the Frenchman, club president Florentino Perez recently suggested to supporters that there would be no further signings. Asked whether there would be any more business after Joselu's arrival, Perez simply responded: "No." Should Perez stay true to his word, Joselu will be the third and final new face at the Bernabeu, with Fran Garcia and Jude Bellingham already making moves to Madrid. Brahim Diaz has also returned from his two-year loan with AC Milan and will take up a role in the first team after signing a new contract.
