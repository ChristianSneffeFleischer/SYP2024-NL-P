Well, that lasted long. Just three days after reports in Germany suggested Bayern Munich had revived their interest in Chelsea winger Callum Hudson-Odoi, negotiations are dead in the water.  Hudson-Odoi has had a frustrating couple of years since initial interest from Bayern in January 2019 faded away. The Blues priced the German champions out of a deal, and he has since signed a long-term contract at Stamford Bridge, but has struggled to build on his promise.  After playing a vital role in Chelsea's victory over Crystal Palace, Hudson-Odoi was the subject of a huge loan bid from the German champions! Struggles with injury haven't helped matters, but he was in and out of the team last season, and had looked to be growing disillusioned with a lack of opportunities. He has appeared in all but one of Chelsea's matches this season, however, scoring against West Brom, and it emerged on Thursday that Bayern were lining up a second approach ahead of Monday's transfer deadline.  A variety of reports reached the consensus that the German champions wanted an initial loan for the 19-year-old, with an option to buy for as much as  Â£70m. Chelsea, however, don't seem interested in selling, and The Athletic's Simon Johnson has claimed on Sunday that there is now no chance of him departing before the deadline.  The percentage has gone up ?
