Jules Kounde has admitted that he was affected by his proposed move to Chelsea falling through in the summer.  The Blues courted the Sevilla defender throughout the transfer window and came close to securing a deal before Sevilla blocked the switch at the eleventh hour.  Reports at the time suggested that Kounde was left furious after the move fell through and the 23-year-old confirmed that the saga took its toll in a recent interview.  "Yes, a little bit, but now I   ve dealt with it," he said, when asked by Telefoot if the abortive transfer had affected him.  Chelsea may be forced to dip into the transfer market for defensive reinforcements again this summer with Antonio Rudiger, Andreas Christensen, Cesar Azpilicueta and Thiago Silva all on deals that expire at the end of the season.  If the Blues do lose one (or more) of these defenders, Kounde would be high on their shopping list - though 90min understands that Villarreal's Pau Torres is also being considered.  Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel hinted at the club's future transfer activity in a recent press conference, saying: "I think every transfer period you need to evaluate again. "You cannot say what we wanted in the summer, we do in the winter. And what we want to do in winter, we want to do the next summer. It is not like this. "Your opinion changes, players change, you have evolvement in the group, you have an atmosphere that you build, you see who is absolutely reliable and these connections build up and create something special hopefully in the group.
