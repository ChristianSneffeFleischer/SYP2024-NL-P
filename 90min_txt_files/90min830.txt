Brighton are prepared to demand well over  £80m to part ways with in-demand midfielder Moises Caicedo, 90min understands. Chelsea are emerging as leading suitors for the Ecuador international, who is also on Arsenal's radar but is seen as less of a priority compared to West Ham United's Declan Rice, for whom an opening offer has already been rejected. The Blues are progressing in talks with Caicedo's representatives and sources have confirmed that an agreement over personal terms is close to being finalised, although Chelsea never had any concerns about being able to meet the 21-year-old's demands. Negotiations between the two clubs are ongoing. Chelsea and Brighton have been in constant contact throughout the summer over a number of issues, including the Seagulls' interest in Levi Colwill and Conor Gallagher, and Chelsea are looking to strike an agreement over a fee. Brighton are prepared to sell Caicedo this summer but 90min understands they value the Ecuador international at a similar fee to Rice - Arsenal have already seen an  £80m bid knocked back for the latter. feed It is thought that Brighton could demand closer to  £100m to part ways with Caicedo, who remains on the radar of Arsenal despite their pursuit of Rice taking priority. Chelsea are keen to take advantage of Arsenal's decision by swooping to sign Caicedo. Scouts have been following the midfielder since his time in Ecuador with Independiente del Valle - the same club responsible for 16-year-old wonderkid Kendry Paez, who will join the Blues in 2025. Brighton would be open to including Gallagher in any deal for Caicedo. The England international also has interest from Newcastle, Tottenham and West Ham and could be among a number of midfielders leaving Stamford Bridge this summer.
