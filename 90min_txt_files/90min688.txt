Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta has conceded 'talent comes at a price' as the Gunners push to complete the expensive signings of both West Ham's Declan Rice and Chelsea's Kai Havertz. West Ham have already knocked back two bids from Arsenal for Rice, who they value at over  £100m. The Gunners' latest offer, a package worth  £90m, was rejected and Arsenal now face pressure from Manchester City to get a deal done. Speaking to Marca, Arteta was first asked about Rice and, given the current status of Arsenal's pursuit of the midfielder, remained predictably tight-lipped. "I can't talk about players who are not in the club. I prefer not to say anything," he said. Arsenal's pursuit of Havertz is far calmer, however, with a fee of  £65m agreed to lure the Germany international over from Chelsea, and that was reflected in the freedom with which Arteta discussed this second move. feed "Talent comes at a price, and at Arsenal we are always interested in youngsters with experience," Arteta continued.  "I repeat, I'm not talking about players from other clubs, but in the case of Kai he has already shown a lot, including [winning] a Champions League. He is a talented player, versatile and only 24 years old." Spending money to rejuvenate the squad has been key for Arteta, who has overseen the drastic lowering of Arsenal's average age. "We have already regenerated the squad, with a very young average and to generate performance and value," he explained. "We have some owners aligned with us: build a winning team that is sustained over time, without so much investment.  "But the demand is increasing and you have to go to the market to find what we don't have to continue improving."
