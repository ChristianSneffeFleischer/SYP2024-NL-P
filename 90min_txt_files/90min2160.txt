The Colorado Rapids have acquired French forward Kevin Cabral in a trade with the LA Galaxy, the two clubs announced Friday. Colorado have sent $600k in 2023 General Allocation Money (GAM) to the Galaxy, while a further $400k will be paid in 2024. Additionally, the Galaxy retain a percentage of any transfer fee should the Rapids move Cabral to a club outside of MLS. Cabral's departure opens up a Designated Player spot on the Galaxy's roster, while the 24-year-old will occupy the same status at his new club. "Kevin is a dynamic and explosive attacking threat with experience both in MLS and in Europe," Colorado executive vice president and general manager Padraig Smith said in a club press release. "He   s an exciting player with all the necessary qualities to be an impact player in MLS, and yet at 23, still has room for continued development." Cabral - a product of the Paris Saint-German youth system - spent two years with the Galaxy following a move from Ligue 2 side Valenciennes. During that time, he made 68 appearances across all competitions, scoring nine goals and providing nine assists, though he never quite found his best form. "We   d like to thank Kevin for his contributions to the Galaxy the past two seasons," Galaxy head coach Greg Vanney said in a club press release. "We wish him all the best as he continues to build his career with the Colorado Rapids."
