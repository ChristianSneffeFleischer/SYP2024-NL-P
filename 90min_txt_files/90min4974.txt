As Mauricio Pochettino begins his tenure as manager of Paris Saint-Germain, the links with Premier League players during the January transfer window are inevitable. Some links will make absolutely no sense, but there are a whole host of players in England's top flight that Pochettino will have previously worked with or against that could add some quality and value to his new squad. 90min takes a look at the best options that PSG should analyse and look to bring to the Parc des Princes during the current transfer window. The most obvious transfer target for Pochettino is undoubtedly going to come from his old Spurs team.Dele Alli has struggled under Jose Mourinho in north London and, much like Pochettino did, looks like he needs a change of scene to get going again. A top team in Europe where he will have freedom to get on the ball and attack, under a manager who knows him better than anyone, it could be a deal made in heaven.PSG lack creativity in midfield and Dele is likely to push for a move this month, so Poch should make the move whether it's on loan or permanent. PSG need to add firepower to their front line and Sergio Aguero's contract expires at the end of the season.There are rumours that Pochettino is keen to make the deal happen in the summer, but with Mauro Icardi struggling for fitness PSG have often been forced to rely on Moise Kean to lead the line this season.Aguero would be a short-term solution on big money, but PSG have money to burn and he is an instant upgrade on their current centre forward options.  It's a no brainer. Brighton's best midfielder, Yves Bissouma's performances this season have seen him appear on the radar of many big clubs.Defensively he has been excellent with his reading of the game and willingness to be aggressive in the tackle, but he's also shown a good technical side to his game too.His passing is great, his positioning is good, he is athletic and he shouldn't be too expensive. Bissouma could be a great signing to bolster a stale midfield.
