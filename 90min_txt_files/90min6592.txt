Zlatan Ibrahimovi   is likely to leave AC Milan at the end of the current Serie A season, amid reports that his relationship with the club's hierarchy is 'no longer what it was'. The 38-year-old returned to the fashion capital of the world in January - eight years after leaving San Siro - after spending two seasons in MLS, where he was a regular, potent goalscorer for LA Galaxy. But the Swede's return to Milan hasn't delivered the kind of goal returns or form that both parties had hoped for, and recent speculation has linked Ibrahimovi   with a move back to his native Sweden. Now, Gazzetta dello Sport (via Football Italia) have added further weight to a possible departure, reporting that Ibrahimovi   has voiced - and led - the squad's frustrations with how CEO Ivan Gazidis is running the Serie A giants. The report hints that the pair's relationship is not the same as it was in January, and the chances of a contract extension at San Siro are now considered 'remote'.  Gazzetta suggest Hammarby as his next destination, which seems plausible when you consider Ibrahimovi   owns shares in the club, and trained with them during the coronavirus lockdown. Bologna have also been mentioned as a possible destination, but a return to Sweden does appear to be the most logical next step. Currently sidelined with a calf injury, Ibrahimovi   may still have some work to do before he leaves Milan - as they look to overcome recent struggles to secure a place in next season's Europa League.
