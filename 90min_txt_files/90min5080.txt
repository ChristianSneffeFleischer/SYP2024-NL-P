Paris Saint-Germain boss Thomas Tuchel is still interested in bringing in Chelsea centre-back Antonio Rudiger in January. Tuchel wanted to land his compatriot in the previous transfer window, but ultimately failed to take Rudiger to the reigning French champions in the summer.  However, Rudiger's lack of involvement at Stamford Bridge so far this campaign has encouraged Tuchel to remain committed to seeking a transfer for the Germany international. Le Parisien has reported that the PSG manager has 'not changed his mind' with regards to the signing of Rudiger, and that the club will 'try everything' to strengthen the squad in the upcoming transfer window.  The French giants currently do not have many options in that area of the pitch, with Presnel Kimpembe and Marquinhos being the only quality, natural central defenders in the squad. The addition of Rudiger would, therefore, provide a boost to options.  The deal is more than plausible, given that the German has not been a key player in Chelsea's season thus far. Rudiger has featured just once in the Premier League and has been used four times in the Champions League. He has been marginalised by the arrival of Thiago Silva and the revival of Kurt Zouma's form, with the pair forming a solid partnership at the heart of the Blues' back line this campaign.
