Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta has admitted he is looking forward to working with Jorginho after his Deadline Day switch from London rivals Chelsea. Having failed with bids for Brighton's Moises Caicedo, Arsenal set their sights on Jorginho and agreed to pay around  Â£12m for the 31-year-old, who had entered the final six months of his contract at Stamford Bridge. It wasn't a transfer Arsenal had been planning for long, but Arteta revealed news of a season-ending injury to Mohamed Elneny forced the Gunners into making a move. "We knew in this market you have to adapt and be flexible and ready for inconvenience. We had a big one with Mo and we needed a player in that position," Arteta said. "[Jorginho] is a great character who'll bring leadership and quality in that position. His intelligence, his personality and leadership skills, he understands our way of playing. He fits really well with what I want to do. "You have to adapt to the circumstances you have, and now we have improved the squad."
