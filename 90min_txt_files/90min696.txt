Barcelona are readying a contract offer to Inter midfielder Marcelo Brozovic in the hope of landing him as a replacement for departed club captain Sergio Busquets, 90min understands. Busquets opted to leave Camp Nou at the end of the season and has taken up a new challenge at MLS team Inter Miami, reuniting with former Barcelona teammate Lionel Messi. Xavi recently expressed his desire for midfield reinforcements this summer, declaring: "The departure of Sergio Busquets is a big problem for me.  Frenkie [de Jong] has stepped up, but I need creative players in midfield." feed Brozovic captained Inter in the Champions League earlier this month and has three more years left on the long-term contract he signed at San Siro in 2022. But 90min understands that talks with both player and club have taken place with Al-Nassr of the ambitious Saudi Pro League. Barcelona also hold interest in the 30-year-old Croatia international and are hoping to dissuade him from taking the offer to move to the Middle East and stay in Europe. 90min understands that Bar  a have asked Brozovic to wait before making a final decision, having held initial talks with his representatives and hoping to put together a package of their own. However, at this stage, there has been no bid put forward for Inter to consider.
