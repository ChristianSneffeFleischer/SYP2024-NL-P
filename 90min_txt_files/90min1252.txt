La Liga president Javier Tebas has explained the measures that Barcelona will have to take in order to legally re-sign Lionel Messi this summer. Messi's contract at Paris Saint-Germain expires at the end of the season and a new deal is not close. 90min understands that PSG have accepted that the Argentine is likely to leave following a two-year stint in France, with talks over a return to Barcelona planned. Messi left Camp Nou in 2021 as they were unable to register his contract under strict financial rules implemented by La Liga following the coronavirus pandemic. Barcelona's finances are still in a rather sorry state, activating several 'levers' and mortgaging club assets in order to spend a bit more freely in the transfer market.

"Bar  a must take many financial measures to undertake Messi   s registration. They need lot of effort to make it happen," he said. "Today, I don't see his signing as feasible. But there's a lot of time left - Bar  a can still make moves to get Leo. We are still awaiting a feasibility plan from Barcelona. They need a big effort to make it happen. They can sell players, for sure - but they still have some players to register too." One of the 'players' alluded to by Tebas is Gavi, who has returned to playing under his youth contract after La Liga and Spanish courts ruled that Barcelona could not register a new senior deal. Gavi's contract expires in the summer and has been extensively linked with a move to Chelsea. LISTEN NOW
