Barcelona are ready to sit down with Sevilla to discuss a move to take midfielder Ivan Rakiti   back to Estadio Ram  n S  nchez-Pizju  n. Rakiti   left Sevilla back in 2014 after establishing himself as one of La Liga's finest creators, but after a few stellar seasons at Camp Nou, the Croatia international is no longer a core part of Quique Seti  n's side. His contract is set to expire in 2021, and Sport note that Bar  a have no intention of offering him a renewal, so they are ready to let him go this summer before he is able to walk away for free. They had hoped to raise    20m by selling Rakiti  , but there's an acceptance that nobody is going to pay that for an ageing midfielder with just one year left on his contract. Sevilla are at the front of the queue for Rakiti  's signature this summer, and the midfielder himself is keen to return to end his career with the club - but they would only be able to afford his wages and signing-on fee if they signed him on a free transfer. Grande equipo! Somos Bar  a! ??      ?? #IvanRakitic #FCBarcelona pic.twitter.com/HMFFdJbPaa The 32-year-old is ready to see out the final year of his deal and leave on a free, at which point Barcelona will have paid him another load of his yearly    7.8m salary, so La Blaugrana are ready to lower their demands to try and get a deal done this summer. It seems highly unlikely that Bar  a will agree to let Rakiti   go for free, but the idea of them dropping their asking price to avoid paying that whopping salary makes a lot of sense for a club looking to save money. Talks over Rakiti  's future have been put on hold until August after the Champions League comes to a close so as to ensure he remains focused on helping Bar  a win at least one trophy this season. Having already offloaded Arthur in exchange for Juventus' Miralem Pjani  , Barcelona are keen to continue restructuring their midfield.
