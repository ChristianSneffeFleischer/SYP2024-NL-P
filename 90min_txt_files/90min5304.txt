Atletico Madrid are on the verge of sealing a deal for Valencia enforcer Geoffrey Kondogbia, despite the transfer market being long shut. Diego Simeone is seeking to bolster his midfield following Thomas Partey's departure to Arsenal late in the extended summer window, after the Gunners triggered his release clause. The Rojiblancos have special dispensation from La Liga to complete a deal outside of the transfer window to replace Partey - the same dispensation that was afforded Barcelona to purchase Martin Braithwaite from lowly Legan  s in February following an injury to then-Bar  a man Luis Suarez. It seems Atletico have settled on Kondogbia as a suitable alternative, and the Central African Republic international will undergo a medical on Sunday ahead of a move worth in the region of    15m-   20m, according to Spanish outlet Carrusel Deportivo. The conditions of La Liga's grace meant that any new arrival had to either be from a fellow Spanish top flight side, or without a club - limiting Simeone's options somewhat - and the deal had to be rubber stamped by 5 November. It had seemed the Madrid club would abandon a deal until January, with Valencia playing hardball over one of their prized assets. However, it appears Atleti have now met Los Che's conditions to facilitate a sale. Kondogbia joined Valencia from Inter in 2018 following a successful loan, having previously plied his trade for Monaco and Sevilla.
