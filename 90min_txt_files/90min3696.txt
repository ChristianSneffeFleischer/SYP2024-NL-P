Tottenham defender Joe Rodon will be available on loan or to buy in the January transfer window, 90min understands, with half a dozen clubs expressing an interest in the Welshman. The 24-year-old has found game time hard to come by since leaving Swansea for Spurs in October 2020, though hasn't looked out of his depth in the Premier League when given the opportunity. Nevertheless, the centre-back remains down the pecking order at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and is set to be transfer listed. While he is highly rated in north London, Spurs accept that he needs to be playing regularly and a loan could benefit his progression. 90min has been informed that as many as six unnamed clubs have already made their interest known in the Wales international, but it remains to be seen what the player's preference will be. Rodon has been linked with newly-moneyed Newcastle United in recent weeks, and 90min reported on Tuesday that the Magpies are working diligently in their quest to bring in around six new faces next month to help in their fight against relegation, though have already been warned by prospective targets that they will only agree to initial loans because of their lowly league position. Newcastle will only be able to bring in two players on loan from other Premier League clubs, therefore it's possible they will pursue a permanent deal for Rodon - given his availability - in order to keep the loan slots open.
