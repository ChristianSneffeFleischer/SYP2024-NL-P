Premier League clubs are said to be 'in favour' of proposals to open their summer transfer window on 27 July and close on 5 October, while an agreement is also expected to be reached regarding a two-week extension, allowing top flight and EFL sides to continue doing deals. Since the resumption of play in June, teams in England's top division have needed to deal with the congested fixture list as authorities look to wrap up the season by the end of July. The Champions League and Europa League is then set to get back underway in August, with the 2020/21 campaign expected to commence in September.  One of the issues that has arisen as a result of the coronavirus pandemic has been the transfer market, and when clubs will be allowed to do their business - especially during such a busy time.   However, Sky Sports now report that all 20 Premier League clubs were given until Monday evening to cast their vote on a plan to open the summer transfer window on 27 July - the day after the league season is expected to finish.  The window would then close ten weeks later on 5 October. This proposal is expected to be approved by Premier League clubs. Additionally, clubs are also expected to agree to a two-week extension to the window, which would allow top flight clubs and EFL sides to continue buying, selling or loaning from each other. This would end on 18 October. A Kant   / Conte reunion could be on the cards...Would Chelsea be making a mistake letting the World Cup winner go? ? pic.twitter.com/SBk4wZbanQ
