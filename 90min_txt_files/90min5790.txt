Gianluigi Donnarumma is reported to have set out his demands to AC Milan, and wants his salary upped from    6m per season to    10m if he is to stay beyond 2020/21.  Donnarumma has long been considered one of the most exciting goalkeepers on the planet, and has made more than 200 appearances for Milan despite only turning 21 in February. He's an exceptionally valuable asset, but has entered the final year of the contract he signed in 2017, and there are real fears he could leave for a nominal compensation fee next summer.  Milan have been working hard behind the scenes to tie him down to fresh terms, but under the tutelage of notorious agent Mino Raiola, the keeper has been playing hard to get. Reports in March suggested he was set to reject the club's latest offer, and had no plans to hang around beyond the expiry of his existing contract.

He currently earns    6m ( £5.3m) per season, but according to Corriere della Serra  (per Football Italia), he wants a salary that would make him one of the highest paid keepers on the planet.  He and Raiola are said to be holding out for    10m ( £8.9m) per season, which works out in the ball-park of    200,000 per week.
