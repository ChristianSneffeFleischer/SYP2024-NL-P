Chelsea are continuing to work on signing a new right-back this month, 90min understands. The Blues have already brought in a host of new faces this month, with Noni Madueke, Mykhailo Mudryk, Benoit Badiashile, Andrey Santos, David Datro Fofana  and Joao Felix all arriving at Stamford Bridge. But Chelsea are not done with their business just yet - another midfielder on their agenda, while they also want to bring in cover at right-back. While there is no doubting that Reece James is first choice, Chelsea want backup and there are a number of options they have been assessing. 90min understands that their preferred option is Inter's Denzel Dumfries and talks have taken place about the possible finances behind a transfer. Chelsea have not been put off by initial suggestions of a deal worth  Â£35m. On this edition of Talking Transfers, Scott Saunders hosts Toby Cudworth & Graeme Bailey to discuss all the big transfer stories. This week's agenda includes Jude Bellingham, Harry Kane, Declan Rice, Hakim Ziyech, Leandro Trossard, Pedro Porro, Mykhaylo Mudryk and more!

Sources have also told 90min that Dumfries has become somewhat unsettled since returning from the World Cup finals with the Netherlands, and he has been relegated to the bench for much of January by Inter boss Simone Inzaghi. Inter are expecting interest in Dumfries to accelerate before the end of the window and 90min understands that they are ready for Chelsea to make some sort of offer.
