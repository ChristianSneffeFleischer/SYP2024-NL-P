Newcastle United have agreed a fee with Everton to sign winger Anthony Gordon, 90min understands. Gordon returned to training on Friday after missing three days - two of which were unauthorised - in an attempt to force through a move to St James' Park this month. Everton had initially been asking for close to  £60m to part ways with the 21-year-old, who was chased by Chelsea during the summer, but have now agreed to drop their demands to around  £45m instead. Sources have confirmed to 90min that Newcastle have offered an initial  £40m, with a further  £5m in add-ons to get a deal over the line.
