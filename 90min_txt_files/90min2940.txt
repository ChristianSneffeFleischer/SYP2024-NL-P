Red Bull Salzburg are standing firm over the future of emerging striker Benjamin Sesko, who has attracted interest from Manchester United and is being monitored by Bayern Munich among others. Sesko has already drawn comparisons with former Salzburg star Erling Haaland and impressed during a pre-season friendly against Liverpool recently during which he scored the only goal. The Slovenian international only turned 19 in May but scored 11 goals in all competitions last season, his first full year in the club   s first-team. 90min understands that Manchester United hold interest in Sesko and have been approached by intermediaries. For the time being, however, it has not progressed any further. The Old Trafford club aren   t the only club keeping an eye on Sesko. Fellow Premier League sides Newcastle and Wolves have also watched him closely, while Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund are keeping tabs on the situation. Salzburg   s partner club RB Leipzig are also following the youngster   s progress. A number of players have made the switch from Salzburg to Leipzig in recent years, including Dayot Upamecano and Naby Keita, who have since gone on to Bayern Munich and Liverpool respectively. Crucially, Salzburg still have no plans to sell the youngster at this stage.
