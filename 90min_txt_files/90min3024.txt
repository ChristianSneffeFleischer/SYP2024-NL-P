It's the rumor that just won't go away, but now there seems to be genuine hope that Lionel Messi could one day arrive in Major League Soccer with Inter Miami. The Argentine icon is just one of a long list of global stars linked with a move to the Herons, whose biggest names so far have been Gonzalo Higuain and Blaise Matuidi - though both failed to impress. But Messi's arrival in Florida may be more than just a pipedream, with managing owner Jorge Mas and co-owner David Beckham hopeful they can make it happen in the future.

"Both David Beckham and I aspire to bring the best players in the world here in Miami," Mas said in an interview with  Diario Sport. "Not only because of the project we're creating but also because we want to be a reference point for soccer in the United States. "When one talks about the best players in the world, Leo is obviously the best player on the planet. We hope the conditions are there for him to be here, playing with the Inter Miami jersey in the United States. We aspire to that. We hope the circumstances are favorable." There's no MLS move for Messi - a seven-time Ballon d'Or winner - in the works right now and, of course, the player still has another year left on his contract with Paris Saint-Germain.
