Real Madrid left-back and Manchester United transfer target Sergio Reguil  n is weighing up the pros and cons of spending another season on loan at Sevilla, with whom he won the 2020 Europa League. Though the Spaniard, will return to Madrid after a breakout season, which culminated in him picking up his first ever international cap against Ukraine earlier this month, he remains behind his colleagues Ferland Mendy and Marcelo in the pecking order at the Bernab  u. With Reguil  n having found himself pursued by plenty of transfer suitors after a successful season both domestically and in Europe, he now has a decision to make AS report that this decision could take him back to Sevilla for another season on loan, influenced by his decision to nail down a first-team spot at Real Madrid. Though a proposed four-year deal with the Red Devils is one of a number of attractive options on the table for Reguil  n at the moment, with Napoli, Inter and Juventus also keeping a close eye on the defender, it would signal the end of his time with his dream club Real Madrid. Reguil  n is thus increasingly warming to the logic of another loan at Sevilla, where his progress has delighted Real's chairman Florentino P  rez. In temporarily returning to Sevilla, Reguil  n would be rejoining a dressing room that loves him, a coach that trusts him in former Real boss Julen Lopetegui, and a standard of football that is arguably as competitive as that which he would find at United after Los Nervionenses qualified for this season's Champions League.
