Ajax manager Erik ten Hag has confirmed star players Donny van de Beek, Andre Onana and Nicolas Tagliafico could all leave the club in the next transfer window. The youthful Champions League semi-finalist side of 2018/19 has already been split up following the departures of Matthijs de Ligt to Juventus, Frenkie de Jong to Barcelona and Hakim Ziyech to Chelsea, and a number of their remaining players have been linked with future exits. Speaking to Het Parool, the Ajax coach confessed that although the current financial crisis puts big departures in doubt this summer, he accepts the club may have no option but to sell if the right price is put forward. He said: "The transfer market will start in August - the top leagues are now being played out, so the money flows are maintained. "The market value of players will be slightly depressed, but not much. Based on their performance and ambition, a number of our players also want to make the move abroad. "Agreements have been made with Andre Onana, Donny van de Beek and Nicolas Tagliafico, but it remains to be seen whether the market is indeed breaking loose. For Onana and Van de Beek, another year of Ajax could certainly be an option, for Tagliafico it is slightly different because of his age." Tagliafico, 27, has been linked with a move to Leicester in recent weeks as a possible replacement for Ben Chilwell, the number one target for Frank Lampard's Chelsea. However, Stamford Bridge remains a heavily touted destination for the Argentina international.
