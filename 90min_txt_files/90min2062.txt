Benfica midfielder Enzo Fernandez has done his best to cool the speculation surrounding his future as he continues to be linked with Manchester United, Liverpool and Real Madrid. The 21-year-old, who only joined Benfica from boyhood club River Plate during the summer, was named the young player of the tournament at the recent 2022 World Cup after playing a starring role with Argentina, which has only increased the talk of a transfer. Even before the World Cup, a number of European giants were sniffing around his signature and there have since been reports that his    120m release clause could come into play as soon as January. It's been a whirlwind 12 months for Fernandez, who has confessed he is doing his best to keep his eyes away from the headlines. "I don't know anything about [a transfer]," he told fans in his homeland. "It's up to my agent, I don't want to get involved. I'm focused on Benfica, in a few days we have an important game."
