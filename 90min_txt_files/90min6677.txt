Chelsea aren't expected to pursue any more major signings following the potential purchase of Leicester's Ben Chilwell, amid rumours linking the Blues to Jadon Sancho and Kai Havertz. The west Londoners shocked the footballing world last week as they swooped in out of nowhere for Timo Werner, who was thought to be Liverpool-bound - agreeing to pay the German's  £54m release clause at RB Leipzig.  But Goal understand the Blues won't be splashing serious cash once they have reinforced the left-back position, thus, big-money deals for the likes of Sancho and Havertz appear highly unlikely. Lower priority targets, however, such as Brentford's Said Benrahma and Villarreal's Samuel Chukwueze, could still be targeted, while alternatives for Chilwell are also being considered, namely Alex Telles, Nicol  s Tagliafico and Lucas Digne. 90min revealed on Friday that Manchester City are still jostling with Chelsea in the race for the Leicester full-back, with both clubs currently deterred by the hefty  £75m fee the Foxes are demanding for the Englishman's services. If the Blues are to make a move for Chilwell - their priority target - then it's understood both Marcos Alonso and Emerson would have to depart beforehand, while a discounted fee will also have to be negotiated with Leicester.  Nevertheless, the absence of a release clause in Chilwell's contract makes the deal a littler trickier.  In terms of other defensive reinforcements, Chelsea could reignite their interest in Dutchman and academy graduate Nathan Ak  , who has a  £40m buy-back clause inserted into his contract at Bournemouth. However, if the Cherries are to go down at the end of the season, it's possible the Blues could swoop in once more and pick up Ak   for a reduced fee.
