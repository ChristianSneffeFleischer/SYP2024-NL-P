Arsenal director Edu has confirmed that the Gunners are focusing on making just one or two big signings this summer. Significant sums were spent last year to recruit the likes of Aaron Ramsdale, Ben White and Takehiro Tomiyasu, all of whom have inspired Arsenal into a top-four battle that looks likely to go down to the wire. It was a rebuild which Edu admits needed to happen, but with the team now in a good shape, he told ESPN that Arsenal will focus their spending on one or two deals, rather than split their budget up over a handful of signings. "Our budget for last summer, we had to use it to rebalance the squad," he said. "There was no point in signing just one or two, the squad was not ready for just one or two players. We had to rebalance. "Maybe this season we can go to one or two players. Today, we have a much more balanced squad. "Our planning has already been done. It has already reached the owners. Now, we're taking things step by step. We're focused on how we will finish the season, but we've put in the planning and I'm very excited."
