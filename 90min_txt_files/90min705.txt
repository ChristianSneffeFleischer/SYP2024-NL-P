Sergio Busquets is to join Inter Miami on a free transfer, reuniting with former FC Barcelona team-mate Lionel Messi. Inter Miami teased the signing of the midfielder in a post on social media after sources close to 90min previously confirmed the two parties had agreed personal terms.  Busquets' arrival in Miami is a significant coup as they had to fight off competition from Saudi Pro League side Al Nassr, who have Cristiano Ronaldo on their roster and have huge financial backing from the Public Investment Fund (PIF). "I'm not going to deny [it and say] there isn't truth in the speculation that we're interested in Lionel Messi and Sergio Busquets," former head coach Phil Neville confirmed in March. Messi confirmed he would be joining Inter Miami in an interview on June 7, with Busquets' arrival now confirmed just over two weeks later. It will be the first time the pair have played together outside of Barcelona, whom they represented together for 13 years, winning several domestic and European trophies. manual 35-year-old Messi will remain the biggest acquisition in Major League Soccer history, owing to a record-breaking contract offer that received backing from the league's largest commercial partners, Apple and adidas - deals 90min reported on prior to his announcement. Barcelona and cash-rich Al Hilal had attempted to sign Messi ahead of Inter Miami, but the former was unable to provide the kind of guarantees Messi was looking for despite his strong affiliation with the club. Inter Miami's offer will not only pocket Messi between $50m and $60m-a-year over time but will also give him an ownership stake in the club, while no details have yet been provided on Busquets' agreement. 90min understands, however, that the 34-year-old will join on a Designated Player contract.
