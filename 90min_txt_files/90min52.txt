Chelsea are expected to match Liverpool's bid for Brighton & Hove Albion midfielder Moises Caicedo, sources have confirmed to 90min. The Reds agreed to pay a British-record  £111m fee to the Seagulls during the early hours of Friday morning and had expected to wrap up a deal for the midfielder over the weekend. Liverpool were so confident that completion of Caicedo's move was imminent that manager Jurgen Klopp openly talked about negotiations during a press conference on Friday. Caicedo was due on Merseyside to undergo a medical soon after the conclusion of Klopp's presser, but has yet to arrive to complete the move to Liverpool and the club are believed to be furious at his representatives. 90min now understands that the Ecuador international has informed Brighton that he is prioritising a move to Chelsea and wants the club to allow further time to receive an acceptable offer. feed Chelsea saw bids worth  £70m and  £80m for Caicedo rejected by Brighton earlier this summer, despite being made aware that only offers north of  £100m would be considered, and sources have told 90min they will now match Liverpool's record sum in the next 24 hours in order to try and close a deal. 90min reported earlier on Friday that Chelsea were refusing to accept defeat in the race to sign Caicedo and it appears they may be given another chance to make their move for their top midfield target. Chelsea have since abandoned their pursuit of Leeds United's Tyler Adams despite agreeing a  £20m fee. Ironically, 90min understands that Brighton have been in touch with the USMNT captain's representatives regarding a move to the Amex Stadium.
