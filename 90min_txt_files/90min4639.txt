David Beckham says Inter Miami are capable of attracting talents like Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar to MLS. Despite having been founded just three years ago, the club already boast some household names from European football, including former Juventus pair Blaise Matuidi and Gonzalo Higuain. Beckham claims it won't be difficult for Inter Miami to add to their growing contingent of former European players, and says the attraction of playing in a city like Miami could see the likes of Ronaldo, Messi and Neymar move over to MLS at some stage. "When we announced Miami, there was always going to be talk about what players we were going to bring in, whether it was Ronaldo, Messi, Neymar," he told ESPN.  "There was always going to be those discussions. I actually don't think it's a tough one for players to decide, to be honest, because it's a great place." Despite admitting he's hoping to attract more European stars to the club, Beckham was keen to highlight Inter Miami's continued commitment to sourcing local talent. "Obviously, it's a great city, I feel like we've got a great fan base, but I also understand there's great talent in Miami and South Florida, and I think we have a real opportunity," he added. "Miami is a city that has that pull on players who have been playing in Europe that are big stars." Beckham's former Manchester United teammate Phil Neville was recently announced as the new Inter Miami manager, after the club decided to part ways with Diego Alonso. He spoke highly of Neville when asked what he would bring to his first managerial role in the men's game, and says his pedigree and experience could be key to the club's progression.
