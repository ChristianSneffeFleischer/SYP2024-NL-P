Newcastle United are set to continue talks with Flamengo over the signing of teenage midfielder Matheus Franca, 90min understands. Franca is the latest South American midfielder that the high-flying Magpies have shown an interest in, having missed out to Chelsea and Manchester City respectively over Brazilian starlet Andrey Santos and Argentine wonderkid Maximo Perrone in recent weeks. Manager Eddie Howe is keen to strengthen his squad with players for the future - evidenced by the recent signing of Australian teenage forward Garang Kuol - and Newcastle are pushing on with their bid to sign 18-year-old Franca. 90min understands that Newcastle spoke to Flamengo over the Christmas period, but talks were put on hold while the Brazilian giants concluded their search for a new head coach - something they have now done after appointing former Porto boss Vitor Pereira. Talks are set to continue between the two parties, and sources have told 90min that although a deal has not yet been agreed, Newcastle are growing in confidence that there will be a positive outcome.
