Barcelona president Joan Laporta has put the ball in Ousmane Dembele   s court over his ongoing contract saga, insisting the player will only remain at Camp Nou if he accepts the offer on the table. Dembele is technically already a free agent following the expiration of his contract on Thursday. He has also been eligible to formally speak with overseas clubs since January. Barcelona were keen to sell him in January but were unable to secure a deal before the transfer deadline. The Frenchman then hit a purple patch of form in February and March, which appeared to change things with regard to his future. But no agreement over a new deal was reached. Chelsea have been keeping tabs on Dembele and in May were keen on speaking with the player with a view to arranging to a potential free transfer. However, Barcelona resumed their own contract talks in late June at the request of head coach Xavi. Laporta has denied there is any sort of deadline on the take it or leave it offer that has been presented to Dembele and his entourage, but it is the only deal he will get at Camp Nou.    He is a person that we appreciate very much    the president Laporta said on Saturday, via Mundo Deportivo.    He has played at a very high level in the second half of the season and the coach is very satisfied with him.    It is an economic question, he has answered us without saying 'yes' or a 'no'.  We maintain a good relationship with the player and there is communication with the agents.  If he accepts the conditions that we have presented, he will continue, if not, then no.
