Serie A has seen a dramatic drop of    72m from its collective wage bill this season, with Italian giants Juventus reducing their costs by    58m, in an attempt to stabilise their current financial predicament.  The Serie A champions boasted a severely bloated squad and wage bill at the end of the last campaign, and they - along with the majority of their rivals - have set about cutting loose some of their major earners.  And the latest figures show that their scrimping has been rewarded. There has been a significant decrease of    72m in the current total salary expenditure in Italy, with Juve's squad being cut by    58m, as the likes of Blaise Matuidi, Gonzalo Higuain and Miralem Pjanic have all been allowed to leave the club, as reported by Football Italia.  Unsurprisingly, Cristiano Ronaldo remains the highest paid player in Serie A, earning    31m of their total sum. Behind the Portuguese superstar sits Matthijs de Ligt, who takes home    8m a year, making him the second best earner in Turin, only slightly ahead of Paulo Dybala's    7.3m.  AC Milan also cut    25m from their wage bill, dropping from    115m to    90m, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic returning to become the club's highest paid player on    7m. Second to him is young goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, who earns    6m a year.
