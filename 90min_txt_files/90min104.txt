Harry Kane has informed Tottenham that he will not look to leave the club once the new Premier League season gets underway, 90min understands. Kane has entered the final year of his Spurs contract and has been pursued heavily by Bayern Munich, who have seen three bids knocked back for the England striker, the last of which was a club-record offer worth    100m ( Â£86m). Bayern had stressed that their third offer would be their last but are understood to be considering a fourth approach for Kane. While the German giants explore their options, sources have confirmed to 90min that Kane has made it clear he will not consider a move away from Spurs once the new season gets underway this weekend. Spurs are due to travel across London to face Brentford on 13 August and, if he is still at the club on that date, then Kane plans to remain for at least the whole campaign. feed That message has been conveyed to Bayern, who now have less than week to make a decision over a fourth bid. Spurs chairman Daniel Levy has not yet given a firm asking price and remains determined to not only keep Kane at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, but also to convince the 30-year-old to put pen to paper on a new contract. Bayern's hierarchy are understood to be divided on their next move. While some are encouraging an improved bid, others believe they are fighting a losing battle and are keen to start looking elsewhere. Scouts have drawn up reports on alternative targets, with the likes of Juventus' Dusan Vlahovic and Eintracht Frankfurt's Randal Kolo Muani on Bayern's radar.
