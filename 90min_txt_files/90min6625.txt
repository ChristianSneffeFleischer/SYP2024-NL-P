Kurt Zouma is attracting interest from Tottenham and Everton, with Chelsea thought to be open to offers for the defender.  The 25-year-old arrived at Stamford Bridge back in 2014 but only broke into the first team this season, after spending several campaigns out on loan. He has made 33 appearances so far this term, though he had lost his place at centre-back to the returning Antonio Rudiger prior to lockdown. According to The Times, Chelsea may allow Zouma to depart in the summer in order to fund a move for long term target Ben Chilwell. Marcos Alonso, Emerson Palmieri and Andreas Christensen could also be for the chop as the Blues try to meet Leicester's hefty  Â£75m asking price.  One possible destination for Zouma is Tottenham. The Frenchman previously worked with Spurs boss Jos   Mourinho during his time at Chelsea and he could prove the remedy to last season's Champions League finalists' leaky and aging defence.  Zouma's arrival could coincide with the departure of Juan Foyth, who looks set to spend next season on loan at Leeds. Mourinho has barely used the Argentine centre-back since taking over in north London and according to Nicol  s Bozza, he will be moving to Elland Road to link up with his compatriot Marcelo Bielsa.
