Bayern Munich manager Hansi Flick refused to rule out a move for Joseph Aidoo after the defender issued a come and get me plea.  Aidoo currently plies his trade for Celta Vigo, joining the Sky Blues from Genk in 2019 following spells in Sweden and his native Ghana. He helped Celta stay up by a single point during his maiden season at the club, making 32 La Liga appearances.  He has also featured heavily this campaign, appearing 22 times in all competitions, although around half of these have come from the bench. Aidoo may not have the biggest reputation around Europe but that has not stopped him talking himself up for a potential move to Bayern.  "I chose Sammy Kuffour as my mentor because for me, I think I will be playing for Bayern Munich in future and he has been there," the defender told  Joy Sports after his side defeated Alaves 3-1 on Sunday. "And that is why I am always looking up to him and he has made a good impact on the football world. When I was a kid, Bayern was the club that touched my heart and that is why I admire them. I do watch their [Bayern Munich] games and even sometimes I go to their website to watch some clips and stuff."
