Inter star Lautaro Martinez has hired agent Jorge Mendes, and has put him in charge of finding the Argentine striker a new club as he angles for a move away from San Siro.  The 23-year-old has exploded onto the European scene with I Nerazzurri, striking up a formidable partnership with Romelu Lukaku over the past 18 months. However, rumours of a summer move to Barcelona turned the forward's head, and he now appears ready to take the next step in his career.  In order to make this leap to one of Europe's elite clubs, Martinez has hired agent Mendes - who famously represents Juventus star Cristiano Ronaldo - and tasked him with securing his new client a switch, Marca reports.  Agents Beto Yaque and Rolando Zarate have represented the promising striker until now, securing his transfer to Europe from Argentine side Racing Club in 2018. The duo will continue to represent their client going forward too, while Mendes has been recruited purely to help grease the wheels and use his contacts to land a lucrative move away.  Martinez has been keen to leave Inter for some time now, having become unsettled following rumours of a possible switch to Barcelona. Unfortunately for the forward, La Blaugrana were not in the financial position to activate his    100m-plus buyout clause, and so the transfer never materialised.
