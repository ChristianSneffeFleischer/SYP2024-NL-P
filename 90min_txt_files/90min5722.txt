Tottenham have seen their loan bid for Torino striker Andrea Belotti rejected as their search for Harry Kane's deputy continues.  The Lilywhites start their Premier League campaign at home to Everton on Sunday afternoon before travelling to Bulgaria to take on Lokomotiv Plovdiv in a Europa League qualifier on Thursday. By the time September's up, Spurs could have already played seven games, depending on progression in continental and domestic cup competitions - a ridiculously demanding schedule to start the new season.  Perhaps never before has securing an able backup for Kane been so crucial for Spurs, with the club desperate to bring one in as soon as possible.  Sky in Italy report that Torino's Belotti has emerged as one of the many potential striker targets for the Lilywhites this summer but have failed with their approach. It's understood the English club want to take the Italian hitman on an initial loan with an option to buy for    50m ( Â£46m).  Torino, however, are only willing to entertain 'outright offers' for their skipper this summer, while club president Urbano Cairo is keen on Belotti spearheading Marco Giampoalo's reign in Turin.  The Italy international has been prolific in Serie A ever since his move from Palermo in 2015. Belotti has 92 goals in 192 total appearances for Il Toro, with his most prolific campaign being a 26-goal season in the 2016/17 Serie A campaign. Nevertheless, with Spurs seemingly unable to fund an outright deal for the 26-year-old this summer, their attentions will likely now turn elsewhere.
