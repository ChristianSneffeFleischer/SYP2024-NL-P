Leicester City enjoyed their best season in the league since the legendary title-winning campaign. Brendan Rodgers' side defied all expectations to finish fifth, while Jamie Vardy became the oldest player to win the Premier League's golden boot at 33 years old.  The Foxes would have been disappointed with how their campaign finished though. After beating Southampton 9 (NINE) - 0 in October, Leicester's form was only good enough to put them 15th, only winning 12 more matches all season. Their poor form saw them fall out of the Champions League places on the last day of the season. Rodgers will be keen to try and replicate the first half of the season rather than the second in 2020/21, and to do so he will need to buy some new players. Before he can do that however, here are five players Leicester should offload. Yes, he's still a Leicester player.Ghezzal was supposed to be the replacement for Manchester City-bound Riyad Mahrez in 2018, but instead he found himself out on loan at Fiorentina last season.Negotiations are ongoing between the two clubs about extending his stay in Florence, with Leicester holding out for    9m. Daniel Amartey didn't feature in a single matchday squad in the league last season, and played just once in the EFL trophy. It is quite clear that the Ghanaian is not wanted at Leicester City and his departure looks imminent, with the player himself suggesting he would like to return to FC Copenhagen - the team Leicester signed him from. It's a move that would suit all parties. Another 'yes, he's still a Leicester player'.Silva joined the Foxes in 2018 and has played 14 times for them since. He spent last season out on loan at Monaco and looks set to leave the club for good with a deal almost done to join Spartak Moscow
