Josko Gvardiol is the top centre-back target for Manchester City and Real Madrid heading into the summer transfer window, sources have told 90min. The 21-year-old has announced himself as one of the world's leading defenders this season, not least because of his displays for Croatia at the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Gvardiol came close to joining Chelsea at the back end of last summer's transfer window, but they couldn't find an agreement with RB Leipzig and so he stayed in Germany. Though Gvardiol is seen as loyal and unlikely to kick up a fuss to leave Leipzig, the club know he is ready to move on and are braced for another summer of bids. READ NEXT manual 90min understands Leipzig would look to bring in  Â£75m for the defender, who will not be short of suitors. Man City and Real Madrid have made signing Gvardiol a priority this summer, though both sides face the same complication in the pursuit of his signature. Jude Bellingham is likely to leave Borussia Dortmund and would likely command a nine-figure fee, with Man City and Real Madrid among the leading contenders to sign him. It remains to be seen whether or not either club would be able to afford both Bellingham and Gvardiol in the same summer. Man City, who are expected to sell Aymeric Laporte, are also monitoring Evan Ndicka ahead of his exit from Eintracht Frankfurt. The Frenchman's contract expires in the summer and so would be a far cheaper option in the left-sided centre-back role. LISTEN NOW
