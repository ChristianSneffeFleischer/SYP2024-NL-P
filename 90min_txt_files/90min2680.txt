Christian Pulisic is likely to remain a Chelsea player beyond the closing of the current transfer window, 90min understands. The United States international has been linked with the likes of Manchester United and Newcastle United in recent weeks after starting just 13 Premier League games last season and being restricted to three substitute appearances to start the current campaign. 90min understands Pulisic is among a number of attacking players unhappy with manager Thomas Tuchel's methods and communication. Fellow forwards Romelu Lukaku and Timo Werner have already departed the club this summer after struggling under Tuchel last season. However, sources tell 90min that Chelsea are reluctant to accept loan bids for Pulisic, while they remain aware of the player's quality despite his lack of playing time and injury struggles, meaning potential buying clubs are being put off by the high asking price. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey,Toby Cudworth  and  Harry Symeou  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Antony attempting to push through a move to Man Utd, Frenkie de Jong and Pierre-Emerick Aubayemang's futures at Barcelona and Arsenal's interest in Pedro Neto.

It's understood that Chelsea are still pursuing Barcelona forward Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Everton winger Anthony Gordon and another midfielder. Should Chelsea secure all their targets, a departure for Pulisic would become slightly easier. However, the Blues are also looking to move on a number of squad players this summer, with Hakim Ziyech, Callum Hudson-Odoi and Michy Batshuayi all among players likely to leave Stamford Bridge.
