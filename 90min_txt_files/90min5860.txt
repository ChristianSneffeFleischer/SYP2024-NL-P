Paris Saint-Germain are said to have taken an interest in Lyon forward Memphis Depay, who started the new Ligue 1 season with a hat-trick in a 4-1 thrashing of Dijon. The Lyon skipper recovered from a torn ACL suffered in December in time to feature in the club   s run to the Champions League semi-finals in the August mini-tournament and has now begun the new domestic campaign in stunning form. Memphis, who joined the Rh  ne side from Manchester United in January 2017, only has one more year left on his contract and this summer could be an opportunity for a bigger club to sign him. A story originating from France Football, the publication that usually awards the Ballon d   Or, suggests PSG sporting director Leonardo has made enquiries about taking Memphis to the French capital, although only initial contact has been established so far. It is also said that Barcelona, Borussia Dortmund and AC Milan are keeping an eye on any developments, but no clubs have yet made a formal bid for the 26-year-old. Manchester United are in the market for a new wide forward this summer and are pursuing Dortmund star Jadon Sancho. They do have a buy-back option on Memphis that was included in the original sale to Lyon in 2017, although there have been no recent suggestions they plan to use it. Memphis made the switch to Old Trafford in the summer of 2015 when he was just 21 and coming off the back of a stunning 28-goal season with PSV Eindhoven. He struggled to make the same kind of impact in England, with questions over his attitude and maturity     a likely factor of his young age     and he was moved on six months into Jose Mourinho   s first season in Manchester.
