Newcastle United are interested in signing Porto striker Moussa Marega this summer, as Steve Bruce looks to boost his attacking firepower. The 29-year-old was involved in 24 goals as he helped the Portuguese giants win another Primeira Liga title last season but with only one year left on his contract, the club are willing to listen to offers for the Malian.   Newcastle struggled for goals last campaign as starting striker Joelinton managed just two in the Premier League following his big money move from TSG Hoffenheim.  Steve Bruce understandably wants to add a much needed attacking prowess to his squad and according to Portuguese outlet A Bola, the club would be willing to pay    15m ( £13.5m) for Marega. They may need to improve on that offer, however, if they wish to persuade Porto to sell.  It is thought that Porto would be willing to accept an offer in the region of    20m ( £18m) but because there is only a year left on his current deal, there is slight wiggle room for negotiation as they don't want to risk losing him for free next summer.  Marega - who has scored an impressive total of 60 goals for the club in 145 appearances for Porto -  is thought to prefer a move to the Premier League, but Newcastle will have to pay closer to Porto's asking price if they want to get a deal done.
