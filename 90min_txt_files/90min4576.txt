Enzo Zidane, the son of Real Madrid manager Zinedine Zidane, is on trial with Major League Soccer outfit Inter Miami. The 26-year-old has been a free agent since leaving Segunda Division side Almeria in October last year after making just three league appearances for the club. ESPN report that Zidane is now on trial with Inter Miami - the MLS side co-owned by David Beckham, a former Real teammate of his father's - though it remains unclear whether he will be offered a contract.

The midfielder spent time in the Juventus academy as a youngster before moving to Real Madrid in 2004. Despite regular involvement with the reserve teams he failed to make an impression on the first-team set-up and left the Santiago Bernabeu in 2017 with just one appearance in the Copa del Rey to his name. Since then he's gone on to represent Alaves, Lausanne   Sport, Rayo Majadahonda and Aves before his move to Almeria in January 2020. The youngster's career to date has seen him rack up 147 appearances, scoring 12 goals. Zidane will be hoping to impress new Inter Miami boss Phil Neville in a bid to secure a contract with the club.
