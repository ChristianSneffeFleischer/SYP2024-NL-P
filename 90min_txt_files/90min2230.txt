Barcelona manager Xavi has confirmed he has personally spoken to Palmeiras sensation Endrick in an attempt to convince the teenage striker to move to Camp Nou. La Liga rivals Real Madrid are chasing the 16-year-old's signature, with Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain also firmly in the race because of their ability to pay Endrick's    60m release clause - something Barcelona could struggle with. Despite their weaker economic position, Barcelona have made their plea to Endrick and Xavi confirmed to ESPN that he has spoken with both the striker and his family about a move. "We have been speaking with his father and also directly with the player," Xavi said. "I explained the project we have in Barcelona. "We want talent and he is a talent, capable of making a difference. He can score, he can dribble, he has a brutal ability to make the difference. He is a player from the present, who is already playing in the Brazilian league, and also from the future. He's the type of player we need. "He's the type of player we need. He knows the project we have here at Barcelona and we are talking. We hope he becomes our player, but it depends on him. It always depends on the player. Usually, a player will end up playing where he wants to play, so it's a very personal decision by Endrick."
