The 25-year-old Ivory Coast international was linked with a move to England last summer but instead signed a new five-year contract in Eindhoven to commit himself to the club until 2027. However, sources have confirmed to 90min that Sangare, whose deal includes a    37m release clause, is now ready to test himself in the Premier League and PSV are open to cashing in while his value remains as high as possible. Representatives of the midfielder have spoken with a number of Premier League clubs to alert them of Sangare's potential availability. West Ham have been touted as suitors as they prepare for the departure of Declan Rice, but Sangare is understood to be looking for a move to a bigger side. Indeed, the 25-year-old has plenty of suitors from towards the top of the Premier League. Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Tottenham are all known admirers of Sangare and have been alerted by his agents. Chelsea considered Sangare last summer as they saw a move for Ajax's Edson Alvarez knocked back late in the window. The Mexico international's name is also being touted around for a summer transfer this time around.
