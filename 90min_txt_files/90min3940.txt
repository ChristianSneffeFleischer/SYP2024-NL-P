Wolves have announced that Spanish striker Rafa Mir has joined Sevilla for a deal thought to be worth  Â£12m. The 24-year old joined the Molineux club midway through the 2017/18 season, but would only make two appearances for Wolves. He spent the following seasons on loan at Las Palmas, Nottingham Forest and Huesca. Mir has most notably succeeded at the latter, scoring 22 goals in 56 games, earning him a place in Spain's Tokyo 2020 Olympic squad. Scott Sellars, Wolves' technical director, said in a statement:    Rafa came to us as a young boy and now he   s leaving us having developed his career, but still looking to progress.    Joining Sevilla is a good move for him and a good move for Wolves as well. He   s going back to La Liga, a league where he wants to play and where he   s had very successful loan spells, especially the last two years at Huesca.    This has given him a lot of confidence to progress onto the next step in his career, and we   re pleased to have helped him in that journey.    90min reported recently that Mir's move back to Spain was nearing completion, and that this in turn should allow West Ham to have a clear run at Sevilla striker Luuk de Jong, who has now fallen down the pecking order. The Hammers have been in the market for a number of new signings this window, but have only been able to bring in PSG goalkeeper Alphonse Areola on loan so far.
