Inter CEO Beppe Marotta has confirmed he is waiting for a bid from Manchester United for goalkeeper Andre Onana. 90min revealed last week that United have opened talks with Inter over Onana, with David de Gea's departure from Old Trafford becoming increasingly likely. Marotta has now confirmed that United are interested in the 27-year-old but stressed that a decision over a formal bid must be taken soon. "Manchester United has expressed interest in Onana, but it must lead to an offer or not," Marotta told reporters. "Then careful assessments by us and by the player will take over." feed 90min understands that Inter are looking for a fee of    60m to part ways with Onana, who was on Chelsea's radar earlier in the summer before concerns over the fee saw the Blues back away from negotiations. United will soon have to make a decision on a bid for Onana but also have the matter of De Gea's future to resolve. De Gea had agreed to a contract extension which would have seen his wages drop almost half, down to  Â£200,000 a week, but United later withdrew that offer and have attempted to convince the goalkeeper to accept an even-greater paycut. That latest proposal remains unsigned and De Gea is now set to become a free agent, with his United contract expiring on Friday evening. Even if De Gea can be convinced to stay at Old Trafford, United could still pursue a move for Onana, with manager Erik ten Hag keep to find high-level competition in goal.
