Fabinho's transfer to Saudi Pro League champions Al Ittihad has been confirmed, bringing the Brazil international's five-season stay at Anfield to an end. The midfielder was a crucial starting XI member under Jurgen Klopp during memorable Champions League and Premier League successes but now joins Nuno Espirito Santo's side who have also recruited Karim Benzema, N'Golo Kante and Jota this summer. There were concerns the move could fall through due to issues relating to the proposed payment structure, but the deadlock was soon broken and Fabinho underwent a medical. A statement from Liverpool ends: "Everyone at Liverpool FC would like to thank Fabinho for all of his contributions to the club's successes during the last five years." Fabinho becomes the second Liverpool midfielder to seal a move to the Saudi Pro League after former club captain Jordan Henderson left Anfield to reunite with old teammate Steven Gerrard at Al Ettifaq. feed The former Monaco star made 219 appearances in total for the Reds after moving to Anfield in 2018, scoring 11 goals. As well as the Champions League and Premier League successes, Fabinho also won both the FA Cup and Carabao Cup during the 2021/22 campaign. The midfielder was picked out for criticism as Liverpool struggled to mount a challenge for Champions League qualification in 2022/23, leading the Reds to strengthen central areas early in the summer transfer window. Alex Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai have been brought in from Brighton and RB Leipzig respectively, while long-time squad members James Milner, Naby Keita, Roberto Firmino and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain have all departed.
