Tottenham, Leicester City and Newcastle United are all showing an interest in Roma's Amadou Diawara, with I Giallorossi  valuing the midfielder at around    30m ( £27m). Diawara has struggled with injuries this season, limiting him to just 14 starts in Serie A so far. The 22-year-old returned to action when play got back underway in June and although he initially struggled, he has since gained confidence and put in an impressive display last time out against Brescia.

A post shared by  Amadou Diawara (@ama_42) on Jun 29, 2020 at 12:38pm PDT The defensive midfielder only joined Roma last summer for around    21m, but he is now attracting interest from the Premier League. Corriere dello Sport report that Spurs, Leicester and Newcastle have all enquired via intermediaries about Diawara.  Roma made it clear that while they are open to letting him depart, any interested club would need to part ways with around    30m ( £27m). It is noted that Tottenham have been keen on the player for 'some time', whereas Newcastle and Leicester's interest is fairly new.  As previously noted, Diawara has struggled with injuries this season, tearing the meniscus in his knee back in October of 2019. This came as a blow for him and the club, but he was able to return to action one month later. However, he was later ruled out with the very same problem in January. He then underwent physiotherapy with the hope of rectifying the problem permanently.  However, while he has now made his return from injury, it is noted that all three Premier League clubs will continue to closely monitor Diawara's performances for the rest of the season. Additionally, they will also be keeping a close eye on his fitness.
