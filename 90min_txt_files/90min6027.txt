Tottenham have confirmed the signing of former Manchester City and Burnley goalkeeper Joe Hart on a two-year deal. The England international, who hasn't played for his country since 2017, featured 19 times for the Clarets in the Premier League during the 2018/19 season. He managed three games in domestic cup action the following campaign. Welcome to Spurs, Joe Hart! ?#THFC        #COYS pic.twitter.com/GAFCevjvg6 Hart will effectively replace previous third choice Tottenham goalie Michel Vorm, who left at the end of the season. The signing also boosts the club's homegrown quota, as Spurs had to name a squad of just 21 players for the Premier League in February, with only four players produced from English academies. The 33-year-old's most successful spell came at City, where he won the Premier League twice alongside FA Cup and League Cup successes. Following Pep Guardiola's arrival at the Etihad, Hart was sent out on loan twice - firstly to Serie A side Torino before a stint with West Ham. Hart is Tottenham's second signing of the summer transfer window, coming after the club completed a deal for Southampton midfielder Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg. He also made 75 appearances for England, featuring at the 2014 World Cup and the European Championships of 2012 and 2016.
