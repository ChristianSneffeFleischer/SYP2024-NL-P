Southampton's search for a prolific striker could be coming to an end with talks ongoing for Braga star Vitinha, sources have told 90min. The Saints have failed to replace Danny Ings following his departure in 2021, but are closing in on a new number nine. 90min understands that Southampton have told Braga they are willing to pay Vitinha's    30m release clause, though it will likely be paid in instalments instead of in one go. Braga, who recently received investment from PSG owners QSI, are in the midst of a title challenge in Portugal, trailing Benfica by seven points but with a game in hand. Vitinha has played a major role in this charge, scoring seven goals and grabbing two assists in 12 league games so far this term. Sources have told 90min that Southampton have also held talks with Lyon over a late move for Moussa Dembele and he could sign before Tuesday's 11pm deadline, but a deal to bring in Vitinha is most likely at this stage.
