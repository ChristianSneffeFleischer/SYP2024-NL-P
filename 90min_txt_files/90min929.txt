Jude Bellingham has completed his medical with Real Madrid as he nears a blockbuster move to the Santiago Bernabeu, 90min understands. Los Blancos have agreed to pay an initial    100m, plus significant add-ons, to land the 19-year-old midfielder's signature, fending off competition from across Europe to get a deal done. Bellingham recently travelled to Madrid for medical checks, including tests on a knee injury which could rule him out of England's upcoming Euro 2024 qualifiers against Malta and North Macedonia. While a final decision on whether Bellingham may need surgery has not yet been taken, 90min understands that the teenager has now completed his medical exams and is one step closer to sealing his transfer from Germany to Spain. feed Real Madrid hope to be able to announce Bellingham's signing later this week ahead of a media presentation in the days that follow. With Bellingham's arrival inching closer to completion, Real Madrid can start to focus on their pressing need to recruit in attack after the quartet of Karim Benzema, Marco Asensio, Eden Hazard and Mariano Diaz all left the club on free transfers. Brahim Diaz has returned from his loan with AC Milan and is expected to sign a new contract ahead of taking a role in Carlo Ancelotti's first team. Elsewhere, Real Madrid are keen to sign Tottenham striker Harry Kane, whose asking price could prove difficult to meet following the signing of Bellingham, while they have also distanced themselves from Chelsea's Kai Havertz due to concerns about his valuation.
