Tottenham Hotspur are convinced that they will start the 2023/24 season with Harry Kane still at the club, while they are also confident they can persuade the England captain to sign a new contract, sources have told 90min. Kane's current Spurs deal expires in 2024, and although the club have tried to tie him down to fresh terms over the last year, an agreement has not been reached. While Kane enjoyed a superb statistical 2022/23 campaign, becoming the all-time scorer for both Tottenham and England in the process, his team came eighth in the Premier League table - their lowest finish since 2008/09. Spurs' chaotic season saw them cycle through three managers, with Ryan Mason ending the campaign in charge after Antonio Conte and then Cristian Stellini were both sacked. Former Celtic boss Ange Postecoglou has now been named head coach on a four-year deal. feed 90min reported last month that, although Bayern Munich, Manchester United, PSG and Real Madrid are interested in Kane, the belief across Europe was that the striker would not leave this summer. Following Postecoglou's appointment at the start of June, Tottenham then informed Kane they had no plans to sell him this summer. Sources have now confirmed to 90min that Spurs remain confident of tying Kane down to a new contract. He is not agitating for a move away at this moment and he could wait to re-evaluate his situation closer to the expiry of his contract next year. Tottenham are continuing to scour the transfer market for reinforcements ahead of the new season. 90min understands that James Maddison remains a top target, though they could back away from David Raya due to Brentford's firm  Â£40m asking price.
