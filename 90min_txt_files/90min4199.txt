Super-agent Jorge Mendes is looking to secure his client Goncalo Guedes a move to Tottenham. The Valencia forward has been pinpointed as one of the players the club would be willing to cash in on this summer as they look to ease their ongoing financial worries. Mendes had been in contact with Wolves earlier this summer with regards to a possible deal for the Portugal international, but following Nuno Espirito Santo's exit from Molineux, Deporte Valenciano now report (via Sport Witness) that Mendes has turned his attention to Spurs as he looks to seal a move away for his client. During Nuno's time at Wolves he transformed the club's fortunes thanks in no small part to some stellar Portuguese signings courtesy of his links with Mendes. Ruben Neves and Diogo Jota were both central to Wolves' promotion campaign during Nuno's first season at Molineux, while the respective arrivals of Rui Patricio and Joao Moutinho helped them solidify their place in the top flight. Nuno's move to north London has led many to speculate over whether Mendes will continue to his 'partnership' with the former Wolves boss, and the early signs suggest we could soon be seeing an influx of Portuguese players at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. The report adds that Mendes    seems to be going with everything' as he desperately tries to thrash out a deal which would see Guedes join Spurs, but it remains to be seen whether Daniel Levy and Fabio Paratici will be convinced to sanction a move.
