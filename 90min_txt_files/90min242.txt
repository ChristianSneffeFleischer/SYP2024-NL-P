Fulham have announced the signing of Mexico international Raul Jimenez from Wolves on a two-year contract with an option for a further season. Jimenez originally joined Wolves in July of 2018 on loan from Atletico Madrid, scoring 17 goals in 44 appearances. His stellar performances from that campaign helped Wolves finish in seventh place, and they were quick to make his move permanent in the 2019 summer transfer window. During his time at the Molineux, the 32-year-old scored 57 goals and added 24 assists in in 166 appearances across all competitions. The former Benfica player leaves Wolves as their fourth-highest goalscorer in club history. He has now joined Fulham and manager Marco Silva, who rejected an offer to manager Saudi Pro League side Al Ahli, and will more than likely take the place of Aleksandar Mitrovic, who's expected to leave Craven Cottage this summer for Al Hilal.  "The Club is delighted to announce the signing of Raul Jimenez from Wolverhampton Wanderers for an undisclosed fee," Fulham said in a statement.
