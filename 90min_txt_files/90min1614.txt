The January transfer window can often throw up some of the most unusual signings as clubs clamour to try and add what they think is needed to their squad to get them out of trouble or cement a winning position. With just one month to play with, selling clubs have the advantage as they hold out to see who will pay the most money out of desperation. Some players are not interested in moving in January at all, whilst some clubs are too unsure of their finances to make any real moves until the summer. Here are the biggest deals from January 2023 across Europe's top five leagues, with transfer fees from Transfermarkt. The Premier League is where all of the spending seems to be getting done this winter with the financial might of the league starting to really show. Some big deals have been pulled off by PL teams, most notably Chelsea.  1. Enzo Fernandez: Benfica to Chelsea -    121 million2. Mykhaylo Mudryk: Shakhtar Donetsk to Chelsea -    70m3. Anthony Gordon: Everton to Newcastle -    45m4. Cody Gakpo: PSV Eindhoven to Liverpool -    42m5. Benoit Badiashile: AS Monaco to Chelsea -    38m6. Noni Madueke: PSV Eindhoven to Chelsea -    35m7. Malo Gusto: Lyon to Chelsea -    30m8. Georginio Rutter: Hoffenheim to Leeds United -    28m9. Jakub Kiwior: Spezia to Arsenal -    25m10. Leandro Trossard: Brighton to Arsenal -    24m Compared to the Premier League, almost nothing has been spent by Serie A sides in January with many clubs unsure of their finances and choosing to bank on what they have available right now. This list looks very different to the Premier League one. 1. Antonin Barak: Hellas Verona to Fiorentina - move made permanent for    8.5m2. Matheus Martins: Fluminese to Udinese -    6m3. Przemyslaw Wisniewski: Venezia to Spezia -    4m4. Abdelhamid Sabiri: Sampdoria to Fiorentina (loaned back for rest of season) -    2.5m5. Mateusz Praszelik: Slask Wroclaw to Hellas Verona -    2m6. Josip Brekalo: Wolfsburg to Fiorentina -    1.5m7. Raimonds Krollis: Valmeira to Spezia -    1.5m8. Tio Cipot: NS Mura to Spezia -    700k9. Devis Vasquez: Guarani to AC Milan -    475k10. Tommaso Cassandro: Cittadella to Lecce -    400k Whilst Serie A is barren of big moves, La Liga is not a whole lot better. With Real Madrid and Barcelona not heading into the market, the two biggest financial hitters were removed from the equation. 1. Cesar Montes: Monterrey to Espanyol -    8m2. Abner: Athletico-PR to Real Betis -    7m3. Viktor Tsygankov: Dynamo Kyiv to Girona -    5m4. Memphis Depay: Barcelona to Atletico Madrid -    3m5. Jose Gragera: Sporting Gijon to Espanyol -    2.8m6. Fernando Pacheco: UD Almeria to Espanyol -    2.2m7. Chris Ramos: CD Lugo to Cadiz -    1.5m8. Youba Diarra: RB Salzburg to Cadiz -    1.1m9. Selim Amallah: Standard Liege to Real Valladolid -    1m10. Denis Suarez: Celta Vigo to Espanyol -    200k loan fee Whilst still not a scratch on the Premier League, some business was done by the Bundesliga clubs for moderate transfer fees. Both Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund entered the market for permanent deals. 1. Jonas Omlin: Montpellier to Borussia Monchengladbach -    9m2. Josip Juranovic: Celtic to Union Berlin -    8.55m3. Julien Duranville: Anderlecht to Borussia Dortmund -    8.5m4. Yann Sommer: Borussia Monchengladbach to Bayern Munich -    8m5. Ludovic Ajorque: Strasbourg to Mainz -    6m6. Julian Ryerson: Union Berlin to Borussia Dortmund -    5m7. Aissa Laidouni: Ferencvaros to Union Berlin -    4.1m8. Paxten Aaronson: Philadelphia to Eintracht Frankfurt -    4m9. Andreas Hanche-Olsen: Gent to Mainz -    2.5m10. Gustavo Puerta: Bogota FC to Bayer Leverkusen -    2m
