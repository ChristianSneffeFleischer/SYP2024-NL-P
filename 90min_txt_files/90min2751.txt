Brazilian forward Matheus Cunha has emerged as one of Manchester United's top options to strengthen their attack in the final weeks of the transfer window, 90min understands. 23-year-old Cunha, who has spent the last year at Atletico Madrid following a  £22m move from Hertha Berlin, can play across the forward line but is perhaps best known for his work as a central striker - which is where United see him fitting in. Sources have confirmed to 90min that talks have taken place between the player's representatives and United. United have been looking to gauge the interest of the player in making the move, and he is believed to be keen on a switch to Old Trafford. It's understood Atletico want a deal that would see them double their money on last summer's investment, at around  £45m, as Hertha are also due a 10% sell-on figure for the former RB Leipzig man. Cunha has four years left on his current contract with Diego Simeone's side. United had targeted Ajax's Antony before being priced out of a move by the Dutch champions, who were demanding more than  £80m for the player. United are now ready to push ahead with a deal for Cunha, who finished his first season in Spain with six goals and four assists. United and Atletico have already held talks this summer over another forward, in Cristiano Ronaldo. The Spanish side are one of those considering signing the Portuguese star, who has indicated he would like to leave United before the close of the transfer window. United have spent the summer insisting that Ronaldo is not for sale, but 90min has been informed by sources close to the player that they feel United are set to relent, and are willing to let him go.
