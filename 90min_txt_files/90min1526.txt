RB Leipzig centre-back Josko Gvardiol has sent Chelsea fans into a frenzy after admitting his desire to continue playing with French striker Christopher Nkunku. Chelsea have agreed a deal to sign Nkunku at the end of the season, signing off on the transfer before the World Cup with a view to eventually announcing the agreement once the current campaign is over. Nkunku's imminent arrival at Stamford Bridge is among the worst-kept secrets in football right now, and with that in mind, Gvardiol's latest comments have left Chelsea fans' mouths watering. "I have never seen before a player like Christoph, he is unbelievable," Gvardiol told The Times. "Every time I talk with someone about him I always say: 'Wherever he goes I want to go with him'." On this edition of Son of Chelsea, part of the 90min podcast network,  Daniel Childs  discusses the defeat to Southampton and what it could mean for the future of Graham Potter.

The Croatia centre-back even admitted to being disappointed by Leipzig's refusal to authorise the transfer. Chelsea wanted Gvardiol but grew concerned about the finances of a deal and instead turned to Wesley Fofana, who cost in the region of  £75m. Benoit Badiashile also joined from Monaco in January for a cool  £35m.
