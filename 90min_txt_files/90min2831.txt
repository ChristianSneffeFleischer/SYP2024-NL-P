Real Betis star Alex Moreno has confirmed that he will be staying at the club despite interest from abroad. 90min revealed earlier on Monday that Nottingham Forest had agreed a  Â£9m deal with Betis for the left-back. However, Moreno has since posted a message on social media confirming an offer arrived from an unspecified club, but that he will knock it back in favour of staying in Seville. "Hello Beticos and Beticas. I want to share this message with you and tell you that Real Betis will continue to be my home this season. It is true that both the club and I received a proposal to join another team," Moreno said. "I am grateful for the important offer I have received, but after talking, both Real Betis and I have decided to continue our journey together. "The love of the fans, the sports project and the confidence that they have shown me from all levels of the club have led me to give my commitment to Betis. I want to continue growing with Betis and all my efforts will be aimed at giving my best to make this season unforgettable again. Mucho Betis!"
