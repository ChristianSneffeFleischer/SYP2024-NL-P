Crystal Palace are reportedly interested in signing Chelsea starlet Conor Gallagher, who has impressed in the Football League this season. The 20-year-old has caught the eye of scouts in loan spells with both Charlton Athletic and Swansea City in the Championship in 2019/20.  According to The Sun, a fee in the region of  Â£10m is believed to be enough to secure his services. The report claims that, with an abundance of midfield options at Stamford Bridge, Blues boss Frank Lampard is willing to listen to offers for the academy graduate. Gallagher, who has represented England from Under-17 to Under-21 levels, has been identified by Hodgson as an ideal candidate to bolster Palace's midfield, an area they are currently lacking in options.  The Eagles have had success negotiating with Chelsea in the past, securing deals for Gary Cahill, Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Michy Batshuayi in recent seasons. Hodgson is keen on either a loan or a buy, though Palace are believed to have the money to spend should they wish take him on a permanent basis.  A strong runner on the ball, Gallagher is a dynamic box-to-box midfielder with an impressive engine. The 20-year-old can play in both deep and attacking roles in the central areas.  After an impressive stint with Charlton in the first half of the season - Gallagher netted six times in 26 Championship appearances - the midfielder was then recalled by the Blues in January, before being sent back out on loan to Swansea.
