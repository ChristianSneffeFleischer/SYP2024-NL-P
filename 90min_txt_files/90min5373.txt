West Ham United are on the cusp of finally concluding the transfer of Brentford forward Sa  d Benrahma, for a fee which could rise to  £25m - while also including a hefty sell-on clause. Benrahma finished the previous campaign as Brentford's most prolific assist provider and second-top scorer but was unable to guide the Bees out of the second tier as they lost to Fulham in the playoff final.  Brentford purchased the 25-year-old Algeria international for less than  £2m from Nice in 2018 and are set to make a sizeable profit on another smart buy. Benrahma has been linked with a move to West Ham for much of the window but earlier this week fears of the deal falling through altogether emerged. Fellow Premier League side Crystal Palace also entered the race for Benrahma's much sought-after signature, however, the Hammers finally appear to be on the brink of securing their target. West Ham are likely to now conclude this much-discussed deal by the weekend, ahead of the EFL transfer deadline. According to a TEAMtalk, David Moyes' side are thought to have offered an initial fee of  £17m, which could rise to a sum in the region of  £25m if certain add-ons are met. Perhaps most interestingly, it is claimed that Brentford have also negotiated an extra sell-on clause of  £8m should Benrahma moves on from the London Stadium. This amount is fixed no matter the transfer fee West Ham receive for their imminent new recruit. Have been doing a bit of digging for @90min_Football into what Said Benrahma will offer West Ham.He's been in the Championship, yes, but is so involved every game and has the attacking intent that every #WHUFC supporter will want to see. Could be a really exciting addition. pic.twitter.com/6t6RBUy1O6
