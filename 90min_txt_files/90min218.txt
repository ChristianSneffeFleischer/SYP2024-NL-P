Brighton & Hove Albion have rejected an improved Chelsea offer for midfielder Moises Caicedo, sources have confirmed to 90min. Brighton rebuffed an offer from Chelsea worth  £70m earlier in the month and, despite a  £10m increase to  £80m - including add-ons, the outcome is still the same. Sources close to Brighton have indicated that the offer was rejected almost as soon as it arrived, with the Seagulls showing no sign of budging from their  £100m valuation of Caicedo. The Ecuador international, who signed a new contract with Brighton after seeing a January transfer to Arsenal fail to materialise, has indicated to his clubs that he would like the chance to move. But he also still understands that they won't sell until their valuation is met. feed Chelsea have long considered Caicedo their top transfer target in the summer market, but will have to return with another improved bid to make their ambition a reality and it is expected that they will. Brighton boss Roberto De Zerbi remains committed to using Caicedo whilst he still can and the 21-year-old remains a key part of the squad for at least the time being. "I   m happy if Moises stays and plays with us. We will play anyway without him. We have to be ready to find another midfielder if Caicedo leaves," said De Zerbi from America, where Brighton are on a pre-season tour. De Zerbi admitted earlier in the week that club owner Tony Bloom had assured him that Caicedo would not be sold unless their demands were fully met and said: "I spoke with Tony Bloom and he told me if the conditions don   t change, Moises stays with us."
