Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta left such a lasting impression on Poland defender Jakub Kiwior that he was 'enchanted' by the Spaniard. Kiwior is set to join the Gunners from Serie A side Spezia, adding much-needed depth to their backline. With a transfer all but complete, Kiwior's agent has been speaking about the role that Arteta has had on the deal. "Just before New Year, [Kiwior] had a phone conversation with Mikel Arteta discussing many details...he was enchanted," he said. "Jakub will sign on Monday orTuesday for Arsenal - he will be in VIP Box for the game vs Manchester United." On this edition of Talking Transfers, Scott Saunders hosts Toby Cudworth & Graeme Bailey to discuss all the big transfer stories.
