Ajax defender Jurrien Timber has confessed that a move away from the Dutch side is 'getting closer and closer'. Timber was targeted by Manchester United last summer following Erik ten Hag's move to Old Trafford but the Dutch side declined to do business, instead convincing Timber to stay for at least one more season. However, United's interest still remains and 90min understands representatives of the Red Devils were in the stands last weekend to get another look at Timber and a handful of other players during Ajax's meeting with PSV Eindhoven. The 21-year-old is seen as one of United's top defensive targets ahead of the summer transfer window, and speaking to De Telegraaf, Timber admitted he could seal a move away from Ajax in the coming months. "A transfer is getting closer and closer, so to speak," he said. "There is a lot of concrete interest and I have made agreements with Ajax. feed "Last year, Ajax asked me to stay for at least one more season and to extend my contract. As a club boy, I did that with love, but after this season we will review the situation. "When I'm with the Dutch national team, I often talk to guys who play football abroad. I want to take that step someday. But when that is, you will find out eventually and it will happen in consultation with Ajax. "I'm still here and I'm in no hurry. The focus is now on the cup final and the remainder of the season." United want to strengthen in defence this summer to provide more competition for Raphael Varane and Timber's former Ajax teammate, Lisandro Martinez. Monaco's Axel Disasi and Bayern Munich's Benjamin Pavard are among those to have been watched by United but sources put Timber towards the top of the Red Devils' wishlist ahead of the summer window.
