Inter have confirmed the signing of full-back Matteo Darmian from Parma. The deal is initially a loan, but includes an obligation to complete a permanent transfer in the summer of 2021. Darmian had joined Parma following a disappointing four-year spell at Manchester United and is the latest ex-Premier League player that coach Antonio Conte has brought to San Siro.  WELCOME DARMIAN       ? @matteodarmian36 is a new #Inter player! #ForzaInter #WelcomeDarmian #NotForEveryone #Football A post shared by  Inter (@inter) on Oct 5, 2020 at 2:31am PDT Darmian joins former United teammates Romelu Lukaku, Alexis Sanchez and Ashley Young at Inter, as well as ex-Tottenham midfielder Christian Eriksen and ex-Manchester City defender Aleksandar Kolarov - the latter albeit via a spell at Roma. Having played just 14 league games across his final two seasons in Manchester, Darmian made 33 Serie A appearances for Parma during the 2019/20 campaign. He had also already played twice for Parma at the start of 2020/21 and is seeking a recall to the Italian national team. A place in Italy   s squad for the delayed Euro 2020 could be up for grabs if Darmian helps Inter achieve their goal and finally topple Juventus in Serie A. The 30-year-old defender last played for the national team in 2017 and has previously been to Euro 2016 and the 2014 World Cup. The move to Inter represents a move back home for Darmian, who hails from the city and actually started his career with stadium neighbours and rivals Milan. He joined the Rossoneri youth ranks as a schoolboy and went on to make his first-team debut at just 16 during the 2006/07 season.
