Tottenham's Danny Rose is set to leave the club this summer, after manager Jose Mourinho made it clear that the left-back is not part of his plans. The experienced defender was sent on loan to Newcastle in January, but with the Magpies recently signing Jamal Lewis from Norwich City, a return to Tyneside seems unlikely for the 30-year-old. With just one year left on his current deal, Tottenham are keen to sell the Englishman to raise some money that can be spent in the remainder of the transfer market. The Sun report that Rose favours a move abroad as he seeks regular first-team football, something which Mourinho cannot promise him at Spurs. The pair came head-to-head in January when Rose entered his manager's office demanding to know why he hadn't been playing in the previous weeks. The confrontation was captured and included in Amazon's 'All Or Nothing: Tottenham Hotspur' series, with Rose insisting he felt he was being unfairly treated by the Portuguese manager. He said: "I was very excited when you came as manager, but if you don't want me to play, I'd rather you just tell me now, and I'll stay at home gaffer, and I'll train at home."
