Leeds United are in advanced talks with Juventus over a deal for Weston McKennie, sources have confirmed to 90min. The Whites have all but accepted defeat in their pursuit of Moroccan World Cup star Azzedine Ounahi, who looks increasingly likely to join Serie A leaders Napoli before heading back to current club Angers on loan for the remainder of the season. Leeds have always showed an interest in United States international McKennie, who Juventus value at around    35m, and 90min understands that talks between the two parties are at an advanced stage. Juventus' lofty valuation is not a figure Leeds are prepared to meet - ideally they would have liked the 24-year-old to join on loan - but sources have confirmed to 90min that a deal worth    28m plus a further    2m in add-ons is being discussed. There is a confidence in Turin that a deal will be agreed with Leeds, and McKennie has already spoken with Whites boss Jesse Marsch about the prospect of moving to Elland Road. Listen now as  Scott Saunders  hosts  Graeme Bailey  and  Toby Cudworth  to discuss the latest transfer news. On today's agenda: Dusan Vlahovic, Anthony Gordon, Enzo Fernandes, Amadou Onana, Malo Gusto, Nicolo Zaniolo, Pedro Porro, Weston McKennie, Milan Skriniar, Maiximo Perrone & more!
