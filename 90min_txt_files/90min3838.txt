Barcelona have confirmed they have struck a deal to sign Kayserispor starlet Emre Demir, who will join the Catalan side next summer. The 17-year-old attacking midfielder made his senior debut for Kayserispor all the way back in January 2019 and has since gone on to become the youngest goalscorer in the history of the Turkish Super Lig, having fired home against Genclerbirligi in November of that year.     [BREAKING NEWS]    Agreement to sign Emre Demir? 17-year-old Turk to join Bar  a B from Kayserispor next season for 2 million euros plus variables on a contract until 30 June 2027#For  aBar  a ?    https://t.co/FQiGMOCSBa His emergence caught Barcelona's eye and the Blaugrana have now confirmed on their official website that they have snapped Demir up for a cool    2m ( £1.7m) and handed him a contract until 2027 with a whopping    400m ( £342m) release clause. As part of the deal, Demir will remain with Kayserispor until the end of the season, at which point he will jet off to join up with Barcelona's B side. Described as a "skilful left-footed attacking midfielder who can also play anywhere in the frontline", Demir has managed 31 appearances for the Turkish side so far, six of which were league starts, and he has chimed in with three goals and an assist for good measure. Those in charge at Camp Nou have been making a clear effort to bolster their ranks with some exciting young stars. The B team have added the likes of Abde Ezzalzouli and in-demand French starlet Kays Ruiz-Atil, while Austrian winger Yusuf Demir was signed for the reserves but has spent most of his time with Ronald Koeman's senior side. That Demir joined on a season-long loan from Rapid Vienna which includes an option to buy for    10m ( £8.5m) and Barcelona will likely trigger that, having seen the teenager appear in both La Liga and the Champions League already this season.
