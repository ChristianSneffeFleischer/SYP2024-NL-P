Marseille winger Florian Thauvin has caught the eye of Leicester City following his flying start to the Ligue 1 campaign.  The news comes with Thauvin   s contract set to expire at the end of the season, making him an enticing free agent option in the summer or a potential cut-price target in January. However, the Foxes may face competition from a host of European clubs for the France international, including Italian giants Milan. According to Calciomercato, Leicester boss Brendan Rodgers has expressed his interest in the winger and would love to have him in his ranks. However, the Italian publication also reports that the Rossoneri have made Thauvin their top transfer target, but a transfer in January seems out of the question with Marseille asking for a figure close to    20m to let him leave early. While an obstacle for the Italians it may not be for Leicester, but it seems hard to imagine the Foxes shelling out that much money for a player they could bring in on a free next summer.  The 27-year old Frenchman joined Newcastle United from Marseille back in 2015, before going on to make 16 appearances for the club, scoring just one and assisting two. Thauvin was hence swiftly loaned back to Marseille, before his former club eventually re-signed him on a permanent basis in the summer of 2017.
