Chelsea defender Antonio Rudiger is 'likely' to leave the club this summer, with Paris Saint-Germain currently the frontrunners for his services after they recently submitted a loan offer.  The 27-year-old - who has two years remaining on his current contract with the west London side - has been left out of the Blues' last two matchday squads for the clashes with Liverpool and Barnsley. As a result, talk of a move away from Stamford Bridge this summer has since increased as clubs have recognised his situation.  The Daily Mail now report that PSG have made a loan offer with an option to buy Rudiger, but Chelsea are considering whether to sell him on a permanent deal now while his value is still high. Indeed, the centre-back is not part of Frank Lampard's plans and it is 'likely' he will leave this summer.  At this current moment in time, PSG are said to be leading the race for his signature, but there is also interest from elsewhere. Barcelona have also been linked with a loan move in recent days, while Napoli are another club who are interested.  There is a need for Chelsea to also balance the books, considering the amount of money they have spent during the summer transfer window. With Edouard Mendy having now joined the Blues officially, attention has turned to departures as Lampard looks to trim his squad. The arrival of Thiago Silva this summer has seen Rudiger fall further down the pecking order - and the club are now seemingly willing to part ways with him.
