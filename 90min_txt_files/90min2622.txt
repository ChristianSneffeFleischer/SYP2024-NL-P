Scott Saunders, Graeme Bailey and Toby Cudworth are back with the latest edition of 90min's  Talking Transfers  podcast. Things move pretty quickly when the end of the transfer window is approaching. Because of that, the guys came together for an emergency episode of 90min's Talking Transfers podcast to discuss the latest updates on all of Europe's biggest deals. With no time to waste, Toby breaks down Lucas Paqueta's    60m move to West Ham, and how things went full circle in 24 hours, before Liverpool's lack of midfield signings - despite another injury crisis - takes centre stage. One of the busier clubs at this point in the summer is Chelsea, who have plans to land at least four new signings, and there's detailed chat from Graeme on Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and the desire to move to Stamford Bridge of both Anthony Gordon and Wesley Fofana. Dynamo Moscow sensation Arsen Zakharyan also looks to be on his way and the guys thrash out what that could mean for Hakim Ziyech and Christian Pulisic.  Everton's plans to spend their hypothetical Gordon money on Neal Maupay and Ben Brereton-Diaz follows, before it's time to sink to Manchester United's attempts to sign Antony and Frenkie de Jong, as well as a potential link to former player Memphis Depay.
