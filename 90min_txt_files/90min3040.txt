Bayern Munich executive Oliver Kahn has described Tottenham striker Harry Kane as a 'dream of the future' as the German giants prepare to begin the search for a replacement for Barcelona-bound Robert Lewandowski. Lewandowski has already linked up with Barcelona as a    50m transfer nears its completion, leaving the Bundesliga giants without a natural starting-calibre striker - Sadio Mane has arrived from Liverpool but is primarily a wide forward or winger. A handful of names have already been suggested as possible replacements for Lewandowski, one of which is Kane, who has two years remaining on his Tottenham contract and famously looked to leave the club last summer in search of a greater chance of winning trophies. When asked about a possible move for Kane, Kahn told Bild:  "He is under contract with Tottenham. Sure, an absolute top striker, but that's all a dream of the future. "Now we have to look at getting the squad together for the current season. So let's see what else happens." 90min understands that Tottenham are not concerned by Bayern's interest in their talisman and there is a belief that Kane is now open to signing an extension at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, although neither party is in a rush to open talks.
