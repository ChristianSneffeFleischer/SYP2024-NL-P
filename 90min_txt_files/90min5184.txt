Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has warned fans not to expect a busy January transfer window, with the Norwegian predicting that the ongoing impact of the coronavirus pandemic on football finances will continue to limit activity     for all clubs. United are still keen on Borussia Dortmund winger Jadon Sancho after failing to land him in the summer, while a new striker remains a long-term target as the club already looks to life after veteran short-term solution Edinson Cavani. United are also looking to bring in a new centre-back, having decided it was not a top priority ahead of this season, and have players like Pau Torres and Dayot Upamecano on a shortlist of possible targets, while getting Phil Jones and Marcos Rojo off the wage bill is another task.    It   s hard to predict [what] other teams [will do] and how the financial situation is   if teams need to sell or if they've got money to buy. I don't predict a lot of ins and outs,    Solskjaer told the media as he addressed the issue of recruitment in the winter window.    The world, financially, and in football, has changed as well also. It depends how the injury situations are at different teams,    the Norwegian added. Solskjaer actually believes he has very good options at his disposal as things stand.    I feel very happy with my squad at the moment. We're getting stronger. I still have issues every week when we only get an 18-man squad to pick from. Who do you leave out? I feel I'm in a good position,    the United boss explained. One deal United have already wrapped up for January is Ivorian teenager Amad Diallo, whose  £19m transfer, potentially rising by another  £18.5m over time with add-ons, was agreed and announced on transfer deadline day in October, subject to work permit approval.
