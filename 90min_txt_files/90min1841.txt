Manchester United will not allow club captain Harry Maguire to leave the club on loan in January. The 29-year-old has lost his place in United's starting lineup to Lisandro Martinez, and has even seen Luke Shaw preferred in central defence when the Argentine has not been available for selection. Erik ten Hag dropped Maguire after a shaky start to his tenure as United boss, but has seen the club's fortunes improve significantly over the past few months. The Red Devils defeated neighbourhood rivals Manchester City 2-1 at the weekend to solidify their place in the Premier League's top four, and are seen as many people's favourites to win the Carabao Cup after reaching the semi finals. Despite Maguire being out of the side, 90min can confirm that United have no intention of loaning him out in the January transfer window as Ten Hag believes he has a significant role to play between now and the end of the season. Listen now as  Scott Saunders  hosts  Graeme Bailey and Toby Cudworth  in the latest episode of Talking Transfers. This week's agenda includes Jude Bellingham, Harry Kane, Declan Rice, Hakim Ziyech, Leandro Trossard, Pedro Porro, Mykhaylo Mudryk and more!

There had been interest from struggling West Ham United, who are looking to add another centre-back to their ranks, while Maguire has previously been linked to Aston Villa. Maguire became the most expensive defender in the world when United paid Leicester  Â£80m for his services in 2019, but he has faced a barrage of criticism for his performances amid the team's ongoing struggles. Ten Hag appears to be making progress with United following his appointment as manager in the summer, but that success has come at the expense of Maguire - he has made just eight appearances in the Premier League and 15 in all competitions.
