Jerome Boateng is keen on a move to Manchester United this summer but there is no indication that the Red Devils want to actually sign him.   Boateng is currently without a club following his release from Bayern Munich at the end of last season. His departure brought an incredible decade in Bavaria to a close. During that period he won nine Bundesliga titles, two Champions Leagues and host of other domestic honours.   He featured regularly in his final season, making 39 appearances in all competitions. However, that was not enough to earn him a new contract, with RB Leipzig   s Dayot Upamecano brought in as him replacement.   Since then, interest in Boateng has been rife but he has not found his next club yet. According to Calciomercato (via the Daily Star), he is dreaming of a move to United - despite enjoying a season long spell with Manchester City 11 years ago. Although Boateng is keen on the move, the feeling is not mutual. United have already competed the signing of Raphael Varane this summer and have good strength in depth at centre-back in the form of Victor Lindelof, Eric Bailly and Axel Tuanzebe. Scott McTominay can also play the position if required.
