The cousin of Brighton & Hove Albion midfielder Alexis Mac Allister has revealed that the Argentina World Cup winner is closing in on a move to Liverpool. The Reds are looking to overhaul their midfield this summer. They ended their pursuit of Real Madrid-bound Jude Bellingham in April and will instead focus on bringing in two to three new players in that department instead. 90min has long reported of Liverpool's interest in Mac Allister, and they are confident of finalising a transfer in the coming weeks. Their pursuit of the 24-year-old is hardly a secret, but Liverpool fans have at least received some reassurance from a member of his family that a deal will soon be done. Mac Allister's cousin, Luciano Guaycochea, has confirmed in an interview with Astro Arena that an agreement is 'close'. "I cannot say where he's going to play, but I think everyone knows it's close, to Liverpool," he said. "It's a big team, but everywhere he goes, I hope he can play good."
