Jurrien Timber has revealed his ability to play Arsenal's style of football is the reason the Gunners signed him this summer. Arsenal announced the  £40m signing of Timber from Ajax at the end of last week, ending the Dutchman's near decade-long association with de Godenzonen at both youth and senior level. The defender is one of three major signings Mikel Arteta's side have made this summer thus far, also forking out  £65m to sign Kai Havertz from Chelsea and a British record transfer fee to secure the services of Declan Rice from West Ham. Speaking to the club's official website about why Arsenal decided to sign him, Timber pointed to the similar tactics he enjoyed at Ajax as key to making the move. He said: "I can see a lot of similarities, especially in the way Arsenal and Ajax want to play. Of course, this is a bigger league and everything is bigger here, I can see that immediately. This is the way they teach you in the youth already, and I'm happy I got to learn that at Ajax. feed "I think also that's the reason they bought me and they want me, because they know I can play this style. And now it's for me to show everyone and also in the Premier League that I can do the same things." Arteta also spoke to the club's channels after the move was finalised, hailing Timber's versatility as a reason Arsenal signed the Dutch international: "We're really excited that Jurrien has joined us. He is a versatile young defender, who will fit into our system and provide our squad with so much added quality. "Jurrien is a young player, but has already achieved so much. He has experienced what it's like to go to a major international tournament on more than one occasion, as well as the trophies he has won with Ajax. We look forward to welcoming and integrating Jurrien into the squad."
