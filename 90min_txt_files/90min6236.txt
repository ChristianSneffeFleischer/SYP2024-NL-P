 Argentine starlet Thiago Almada has confirmed he would be keen on working under Marcelo Bielsa, with Leeds interested in signing the talented teenager. The versatile Almada rose to prominence in his native Argentina during the 2019/20 Superliga in which he scored four times as his side, Velez Sarsfield, stood third in the table prior to the league's cancellation in April. The 19-year-old's stellar showings under former Argentina international Gabriel Heinze at Velez led to some of Europe's elite taking notice, with Barcelona and Manchester United both known to have - or at least had - an interest in acquiring Almada this summer. Leeds, however, have emerged as a potential suitor for the talented playmaker and alongside Almada, the Premier League bound outfit are also said to be keen on drafting in Argentine quartet Juan Foyth, Lucas Martinez Quarta, Matias Zaracho and Nicolas Gonzalez this summer.  Almada, however, would certainly top that list in regards to talent and speaking to Argentine sports channel TyC Sports, he spoke of his desire to work under one of football's greatest minds: Bielsa.     I would like Bielsa to coach me,    he said.    My friends sent me something about Bielsa, but I am calm. Whether it happens or not, we have to see. I don   t watch much soccer, but I saw some Leeds highlights and I saw something similar to what we did in V  lez with Heinze.  Leeds rounded off their unforgettable Championship campaign with a 4-0 victory against the relegated Charlton on Wednesday night, with their sights very much well on the top flight.
