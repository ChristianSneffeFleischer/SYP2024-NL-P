Inter sporting director Piero Ausilio is confident that defender Milan Skriniar will remain at the club this summer amid speculation linking the centre-back with Tottenham.  Skriniar evolved into the Nerazzurri's most prized defensive asset during Luciano Spalletti's reign at the San Siro, but the Slovakia international's status has gone from irreplaceable to dispensable following the arrival of Antonio Conte as manager last summer. After starring in a back four under Spalletti, Skriniar struggled somewhat to adapt to Conte's three-at-the-back system last term, with Stefan de Vrij emerging as Inter's premier centre-half.  Thus, with the 25-year-old still holding plenty of value, Conte was reportedly willing to see the back of the defender this summer in a bid to recoup funds and invest elsewhere in the Nerazzurri squad.  Spurs have been linked with a move for Skriniar amid Jose Mourinho's search for a new centre-half, but after discussions between the two clubs failed to result in a deal, sporting director Ausilio has made it clear that the Slovakian will remain an Inter player this summer.     We reiterated that Skriniar is not on the market and no offers have arrived in this sense, rather than reiterating that he will stay here I don   t know what to say,    he said, as quoted by Tuttomercatoweb. It's understood that the two parties failed to reach an agreement over a fee, with Skriniar intrigued by the possibility of the Premier League and working with Jose Mourinho. Inter were looking for    50m for the 25-year-old's services, a valuation the Lilywhites are yet to match.
