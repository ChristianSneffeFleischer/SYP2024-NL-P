Tottenham midfielder Tanguy Ndombele is keen to leave the club, and Barcelona could look to pursue some form of player-plus-cash deal, with the Catalan giants willing to include either Philippe Coutinho  or Nelson Semedo as part of the move. SHOP BARCELONA: Get the newest gear from Nike! Ndombele made the switch to north London last summer, with Tottenham forking out over  Â£50m for his services. But while he has shown flashes of brilliance, he hasn't really been given an extended run in the team.  The midfielder has also come in for criticism from Jose Mourinho, with the boss claiming in March after a draw with Burnley that he should have given 'more to the team'. Since the Premier League got back underway, he has yet to even come off the bench for Spurs.  It was suggested in April that Ndombele was 'ready' to quit Tottenham, with both Barcelona and PSG keen on signing him. The Independent now report that Bar  a remain keen on his services, but their financial struggles at this moment in time can't be ignored. As a result, while they are keen on bringing him to Camp Nou, they will only be willing to discuss a deal if it involves a player exchange.  The report adds that La Blaugrana are willing to include either Coutinho or Semedo, both of whom have been linked with moves away from the club in recent times, as part of the deal. Spurs will look to stand firm in their valuation of Ndombele (the same amount they paid to Lyon), but Mourinho 'may' decide it is better for the club to part ways and start fresh.
