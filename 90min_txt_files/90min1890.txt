Borussia Monchengladbach manager Daniel Farke has warned Chelsea that he does not want to lose striker Marcus Thuram this month. Thuram is in the final six months of his contract and is set to leave Gladbach in 2023, with Chelsea keen to win the race in January before he walks away on a free transfer in the summer. Teams from across Europe have voiced their interest in Thuram, who has bagged ten goals and three assists in 15 Bundesliga games this season, but Farke has warned Chelsea and other suitors that he is ready to fight to keep his star striker. "At this level, you can never be sure until the transfer window closes," Farke said. "But we have made our point of view clear. He is a key player for us and we have no intention of giving up one of our quality players. "With Marcus, I don't think there are that many clubs that particularly appeal to him. I think he feels right at home here at Borussia Monchengladbach. He came back from the World Cup in good shape, is motivated. "You can never rule anything out in this business, but I am very, very sure that he will play a  very, very good second half of the season for us."
