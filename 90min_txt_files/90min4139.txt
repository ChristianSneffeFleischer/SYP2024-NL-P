Tottenham's bid to freshen up their squad this summer will rely on them selling players before they can buy, and new head coach Nuno Espirito Santo has outlined a long list of players available for sale. With the arrival of Bologna defender Takehiro Tomiyasu edging closer and Spurs also interested in Sevilla's Jules Kounde, the club are desperate to generate transfer funds via player sales to avoid having to cash in on talisman Harry Kane. The Athletic report that no fewer than six first-team squad members are available for sale this summer including Davinson Sanchez, Serge Aurier, Moussa Sissoko, Erik Lamela and Lucas Moura, with others still waiting to hear whether they have a future at the club. Tottenham's defence is in dire need of strengthening, and with that in mind Nuno has told the club that both Sanchez and Aurier can leave. Sanchez has struggled to adapt to life in the Premier League since his mega-money move from Ajax in 2017, while Aurier has improved of late but has still come under criticism for his tendency to produce rash challenges. Toby Alderweireld has already signalled his intention to leave Spurs this summer and the club are also hoping to offload youngster Cameron Carter-Vickers. Sissoko is another who is available for sale - despite the Frenchman making 42 appearances in all competitions last season - though Harry Winks is still waiting to discuss his future with Nuno.
