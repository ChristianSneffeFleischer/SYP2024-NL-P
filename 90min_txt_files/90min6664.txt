Tottenham Hotspur have been named as one of a number of clubs hoping to add Wolverhampton Wanderers' R  ben Neves to their squad this summer, with Spurs manager Jos   Mourinho an admirer of his countryman. Neves has been one of Wolves' key players during a season which has seen them progress to the Europa League Round of 16 and push for the Champions League places in the Premier League. Meanwhile, though Spurs have been tipped for a quiet summer in the transfer market as they attempt to manage the economic ramifications of the COVID-19 pandemic, the need to add a defensive midfielder to their squad has emerged as a theme of their 2019/20 season. 12 - 12 of Ruben Neves' 15 goals for Wolves in all competitions have come from outside the box, the other three have been from the penalty spot.

The report explains that Neves has caught the eye of Mourinho, who in Jorge Mendes shares an agent with the anchorman. Tottenham have found it difficult to make their midfield work this season, with new signings Giovani Lo Celso and Tanguy Ndombele struggling with fitness complaints, and January recruit Gedson Fernandes unable to nail down a starting spot before the cancellation of Premier League football. Neves is not the only midfielder that Spurs have their eye on, with Southampton's Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg also named as a possible target for Mourinho to bolster his options in the middle of the park.
