Barcelona have signed 18-year-old Austria international Yusuf Demir from Rapid Vienna on loan for the 2021/22 season, with an option to make the transfer permanent next summer. Demir only turned 18 last month and was just 16 when he made his senior debut for Rapid at the end of 2019. Although born in Turkey, he has lived in Austria since childhood and made his senior international debut for the country in March. ?? New signing for @FCBarcelonaB!    Yusuf Demir? @skrapid | Red Ring Shotshttps://t.co/FR1nKetO7x A statement from Bar  a disclosed that the club is paying    500,000 as a loan fee to have Demir for the duration of the 2021/22 campaign. The    non-mandatory    option to buy is set at    10m. He would be initially expected to link up with Bar  a B but could get a chance to play with the first-team. Ansu Fati and Pedri are good recent examples of Bar  a teenagers proving that talent trumps age, with the latter making 52 appearances for the club last season. If he gets on the pitch, Demir would be the second Austrian to play for Barcelona after national hero Hans Krankl, who scored 29 La Liga goals in 1978/79 and won the Pichichi Trophy. Prior to joining Bar  a, Demir was linked with a number of other to European clubs earlier this year. Real Madrid, Juventus, Manchester United, Manchester City and Borussia Dortmund were all rumoured to have been keeping tabs on his development.
