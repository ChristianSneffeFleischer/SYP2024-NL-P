Manchester United chief executive Richard Arnold is trying to persuade Cristiano Ronaldo to withdraw his request to leave Old Trafford.  Arnold has also flown to Barcelona with football director John Murtough to try and thrash out a deal for Dutch midfielder Frenkie de Jong - a move that has stalled over the past week or so. United could turn to Leicester's Youri Tielemans or Wolves' Ruben Neves if they are unable to land De Jong. Chelsea are ready to move on from Raphinha, who looks set to join Barcelona after terms were finally agreed with Leeds, and have interest in Bayern Munich winger Serge Gnabry. Arsenal have offered Benfica  £6m for 26-year-old left-back Alex Grimaldo, who is into the final year of his contract. AC Milan are hopeful of landing Moroccan winger Hakim Ziyech, with Chelsea open to discussing a permanent transfer. Declan Rice has a 'gentleman's agreement' with West Ham to stay for one more season. Chelsea, Manchester United and Manchester City have all been linked with the England star. Newcastle are considering a move for Espanyol striker Raul de Tomas, a player who was previously of interest to Arsenal and Juventus.
