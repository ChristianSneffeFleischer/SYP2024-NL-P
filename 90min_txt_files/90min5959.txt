Donny van de Beek is awaiting offers from the Premier League as he gears up for a move away from Ajax this summer, but the club are yet to receive any formal offers. The midfielder has been linked with a move away this summer and Ajax are willing to let him leave if a reasonable offer comes in, with Manchester United, Barcelona and Real Madrid all linked with a move. Sky Sports report that Van de Beek is still 'likely' to leave Ajax this summer and will consider a move to the Premier League, but is still happy in Amsterdam as he awaits an offer. Ajax have been open to selling key players should a suitable fee come in for them, having sold both Frenkie de Jong and Matthijs de Ligt last summer to Barcelona and Juventus respectively. They've already sold Hakim Ziyech to Chelsea for a fee of  Â£33.4m this summer, and won't stand in the way of Van de Beek should the chance to move on arise. He was closely linked with a move to Real Madrid before the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, but a deal was never finalised. This has allowed the likes of United and Barcelona to keep tabs on the Dutchman, as they both look to rebuild their squads for next season.
