Lautaro Martinez is poised to sign a contract extension at Inter - with the new deal featuring an 'anti Juventus' clause. Martinez has established himself as one of the most exciting young forwards in world football after joining Inter from Racing Club in his native Argentina in 2018, and was the subject of heavy interest from Barcelona during the 2020 transfer window. A move to the Catalan giants ultimately failed to materialise, and despite the forward admitting in January that it was a 'big dream' of his to play alongside compatriot Lionel Messi at Barcelona, he is now preparing to commit his long term future to Inter. Italian media report (via Marca) that Martinez's agents Beto Yaque and Rolando Zarate are in talks with Inter to extend his current deal - which runs until 2023 - for a further season. The new contract will include his current    111m buyout clause, but with the addition of an 'anti Juventus' buyout clause of    150m should their Serie A rivals attempt to prise him away from San Siro. Martinez will also receive a bumper salary increase, resulting in him pocketing    7m per year - equivalent to around    150,000 per week. News of Martinez closing on a new deal is perhaps not expected, after he spoke earlier in the month of his happiness in the city of Milan, as well as touching on his admiration for Messi.    It was a big dream for me,    Martinez admitted.    It   s amazing to play with him (Messi), he is the best player in the world and I am lucky enough to play with him in the national team. He is an inspiration for young players.
