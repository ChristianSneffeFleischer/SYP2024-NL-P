Mason Mount has been questioned about his potential move to Manchester United at the Spanish Grand Prix. 90min reported earlier in the week Mount's representatives had agreed personal terms in principle with Man Utd ahead of a summer move to Old Trafford. Liverpool, Arsenal and Newcastle United have also spoken to the midfielder after talks with current club Chelsea regarding a new contract stalled. Ahead of Sunday's Formula One race in Spain, Mount was cornered by Sky Sport's Martin Brundle and queried about the potential move to the Red Devils, to which he replied: "I am just here to enjoy this race today! Amazing day, can't wait to watch it now." Brundle also talked to Mount's teammate and pal Ben Chilwell about the midfielder's potential transfer, replying he'd be delighted if Mount stayed at Chelsea. feed "It's none of my business personally but he is my best mate so I would love him to stay." While personal terms have been agreed, 90min understands Man Utd's valuation of Mount falls some way short of what Chelsea would like to recoup in the transfer window. Man Utd are keen to offer around  £50m while the Blues are holding out for a fee closer to  £75m. The midfielder still has one year left on his current contract at Stamford Bridge and new manager Mauricio Pochettino is believed to be keen to keep hold of him.
