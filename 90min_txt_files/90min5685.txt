Tottenham Hotspur full-back Danny Rose is nearing a move to Serie A club Genoa, with talks now described as    advanced   . His expected departure will in turn remove a sizeable contract from the wage bill as Spurs prepared to bring in Sergio Reguilon and Gareth Bale. Rose has fallen completely out of favour at Spurs, the club he joined at 17, to the point where he has not even been assigned a new squad number of the 2020/21 season. The 30-year-old   s frustrations over a lack of opportunities were highlighted in Amazon Prime   s All or Nothing series and he finished last season on loan at Newcastle. The Daily Mirror writes that negotiations between Spurs and Genoa are ongoing and are at an    advanced    stage. The deal is more likely to be a permanent one owing to the fact that Rose is due to be out of contract at the end of the season. This way, Spurs may recoup a small transfer fee. Rose became a first-team regular at Spurs in 2013 following a successful loan at Sunderland and had earlier burst onto the scene as a teenager when he scored a screamer on his debut against Arsenal. He played 26 Premier League games as recently as 2018/19, his second highest tally of league appearances in a single season for Spurs, but has quickly fallen out of favour over the last 12 months. Danny Rose has given THIRTEEN YEARS service to the Tottenham and they did not even have the DECENCY to tell him he would not be given a squad number, whilst being made to do pre season with the YOUTH TEAM.Loyalty in football DOES NOT exist, the game really STINKS at times. The Athletic revealed earlier this week that Rose was told he had no future at Tottenham when he returned to the club from his loan at Newcastle and has been training with the Under-23 squad.
