Chelsea are long-term admirers of Real Madrid midfielder Casemiro, 90min understands, and the Blues would be interested in signing the Brazilian this summer. The 30-year-old has been a core part of Real's successful midfield since returning from his loan with Porto in 2015, and his status as one of the game's best defensive midfielders has recently piqued the interest of Manchester United. However, 90min understands that Chelsea have been looking at Casemiro far longer than United and Blues owner Todd Boehly is considering a late summer bid for the Brazil international. A natural defensive midfielder has been part of Chelsea's transfer wish list for years and scouts have done plenty of work on Casemiro, who only signed a new contract with Real last August. Los Blancos are reluctant to sell Casemiro - manager Carlo Ancelotti is desperate to keep his famous midfield trio together - but it is understood that Real could be tempted to do business if an offer of over    60m ( Â£51m) arrived. Such a fee would make Casemiro the second-most expensive over-30 player ever, behind only Cristiano Ronaldo's    112m move to Juventus in 2018. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  &  Toby Cudworth  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Erik ten Hag wanting to sign five players before the transfer window closes, and Man Utd's attitude to selling Cristiano Ronaldo.
