Tottenham have completed the signing of winger Dejan Kulusevski from Juventus on a permanent deal. The Sweden international joined Spurs on loan in January 2022 on a deal which included an option to make the deal permanent for a fee of around  £30m, but Spurs declined to trigger that clause and instead pursued a discount. As 90min reported on Friday, the two clubs settled on a fee of closer to  £25m and Kulusevski has now completed his return to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Kulusevski has inked a five-year contract and becomes the first signing of the Ange Postecoglou era. feed Kulusevski endured a mixed 18 months on loan in London. He racked up seven goals and 16 assists in 57 appearances in all competitions, often looking like one of Spurs' top talents when he was in form. A red-hot start to life in England, which yielded five goals and eight assists in his first six months at the club, had Spurs fans relishing the bargain they had found but mixed form over the remaining year took a toll on the 23-year-old's statistics. Kulusevski's loan contract also included an obligatory purchase clause which would have been triggered if Spurs finished in the top four this season, but the Swede was powerless to stop his side finishing eighth. He is now set for a fresh start under Postecoglou, who 90min understands is keeping an open mind to working with Kulusevski.
