Chelsea are making progress in their pursuit of Juventus defender Matthijs de Ligt but may still have to pay the  £102m release clause in the Netherlands international's contract. Juve are interested in taking Timo Werner to Turin as a potential makeweight in any deal. In addition to De Ligt, Chelsea are also eyeing Paris Saint-Germain centre-back Presnel Kimpembe and Manchester City's Nathan Ake - although the Premier League champions want to sign a replacement before sanctioning any deal. Chelsea withdrew from the race to sign Richarlison when Tottenham pushed the price to  £60m, with the Brazilian's move from Everton now completed. Juventus could ask Liverpool to swap Roberto Firmino for Adrien Rabiot, while there's also interest in Gabriel Magalhaes of Arsenal. The Gunners, however, are unlikely to sell. Barcelona could offer up to  £60m for Leeds winger Raphinha after coming back to the negotiating table in a bid to trump Chelsea. Arsenal remain interested.

Bayern Munich have rejected a third Barcelona bid for Robert Lewandowski because they adamant on getting    50m for the veteran striker. Arsenal are still  £5m short of matching Ajax   s valuation for defender Lisandro Martinez, with a second bid of  £38m rejected.
