Barcelona are understood to be on the verge of securing a summer deal for Flamengo midfielder Gerson. The La Liga giants have been credited with an interest in the 23-year-old for some time now and had looked set to thrash out a deal for the midfielder back in 2015. However, the Brazilian ultimately opted for a move to Serie A side Roma, though the move didn't quite go to plan and he headed back to his home country in 2019 having mustered just 28 league appearances for the club before being shipped out on loan to Fiorentina for a season. Despite his initial failed foray into European football, Bar  a have continued to monitor Gerson's progress in Brazil, and Spanish television outlet El Chiringuito (via ESPN) now report that the Blaugrana have agreed terms on a deal for the midfielder. The report adds that a fee of    25m ( Â£21.5m) has been agreed between the two sides as Barcelona look to add some much needed youth to their squad ahead of next season. Gerson's performances since leaving Roma in 2019 have attracted interest from a host of European clubs, with Borussia Dortmund and Premier League pair Chelsea and Tottenham both said to be keen to acquire the youngster's services.
