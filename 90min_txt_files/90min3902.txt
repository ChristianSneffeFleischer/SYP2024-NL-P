Manchester United could send Daniel James out on loan before Tuesday's transfer deadline or even to Leeds on a permanent basis, but Amad Diallo is definitely staying at Old Trafford. 23-year-old James has started two of United's first three Premier League games, but was replaced after just 52 minutes of the weekend win over Wolves by Anthony Martial. The Welshman is also competing for a starting berth with Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford, while Mason Greenwood is also likely to be pushed out wide once Cristiano Ronaldo completes his sensational return to Old Trafford. The Athletic note that James is attracting interest from a number of Premier League sides, and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer may sanction a loan deal before the summer window closes. Leeds, who previously came within a whisker of signing James, are known admirers, and there's also considerable interest in the Welshman from Graham Potter's Brighton. Everton, Leicester and Crystal Palace have also considered the speedster recently. Prominent Italian journalist Fabrizio Romano goes further by suggesting that Leeds and United are in advanced negotiations over a permanent transfer, adding that personal terms still need to be thrashed out before an agreement is reached. James' departure may be hastened now that Amad is no longer leaving United to join Feyenoord on loan. The Ivorian was all set for a move to the Eredivisie, but a training ground injury has ended his chances of going to the Netherlands - Amad will need at least six weeks to recover from a thigh problem. A loan exit also can't be ruled out for Jesse Lingard, although United's stance will have to soften for West Ham to consider coming in with a bid. The 28-year-old shone during a six-month loan spell at the London Stadium last season, but returned to Old Trafford to fight for his place.
