Leon Goretzka has informed Bayern Munich that he intends to stay and fight for his place despite increasing speculation over a summer exit, sources have told 90min. Though often seen as a lynchpin of their midfield, Goretzka has failed to start more than 23 games in a Bundesliga season for Bayern since his move from Schalke in 2018 and he was used sparingly by Thomas Tuchel towards the end of their most recent campaign. The Bavarians endured a particularly unimpressive 2022/23 season in which they secured an 11th-straight title on the final day due to a collapse from rivals Borussia Dortmund. Bayern have been looking to bolster their squad with high-profile additions this transfer window, with Kim Min-jae's    50m move from Napoli expected to be confirmed shortly and talks ongoing with Tottenham over a deal for Harry Kane, though Spurs have shown little sign of softening their stance that he will stay. feed Goretzka has been one current player tipped to leave Bayern to make way for a fresh wave of stars, but 90min understands he has no desire to leave the Allianz Arena. Bayern had informed Goretzka that he could be sold and his representatives made this known to clubs across Europe, but the midfielder's stance over a move has meant that they are unlikely to receive any forthcoming offers. Liverpool and Manchester United have been linked with Goretzka, and though sources have confirmed to 90min that both have monitored him in the past, they will not advance their interests due to his intentions to stay at Bayern. Reports in Germany this week have touted West Ham with an interest, but like Liverpool and Man Utd will not follow through with an offer while the midfielder is determined to remain in with Bayern. Should Goretzka have a change in heart, 90min understands that several Premier League teams could firm up their interest, but the expectation is he will not leave this window.
