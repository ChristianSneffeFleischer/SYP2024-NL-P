James Ward-Prowse is ready to leave Southampton this summer with the club on the brink of relegation from the Premier League, 90min understands. The Saints sit bottom of the table having picked up just 23 points from 31 games and are four points from safety having won just one of their last eight league games. Though relegation to the Championship is far from assured, it is a possibility that is looking far more probable by the week. Sources have told 90min that a number of key players - including Kyle Walker-Peters, Mohammed Salisu, Armel Bella-Kotchap and Romeo Lavia - are expected to leave St. Mary's if they go down. England international and set-piece extraordinaire Ward-Prowse is also prepared to part ways with the club he has represented since the age of eight. 90min understands that Southampton will demand around  Â£50m for their club captain, who is the subject of interest from several top-flight sides. READ MORE FROM THE 90MIN TALKING TRANSFERS TEAM feed Newcastle United manager Eddie Howe and sporting director Dan Ashworth are both huge fans of Ward-Prowse. The Magpies are being kept informed of the player's developing situation on the south coast, though their summer business hinges on their final position in the standings - Newcastle currently sit fourth and are on course to qualify for the Champions League. Manchester United also believe that Ward-Prowse could solve some of their own midfield problems, while Aston Villa and Tottenham Hotspur are also admirers of the 28-year-old.
