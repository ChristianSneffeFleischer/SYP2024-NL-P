Manchester City Women are in talks with North Carolina Courage over a deal to bring 27-year-old centre-back Abby Dahlkemper over to the Academy Stadium. A core part of the United States Women's National Team, Dahlkemper was the only outfield player to start every game for her country during their run to 2019 World Cup glory, while she also led the Courage to the NWSL title that year as well. The defender is currently with the rest of her USWNT teammates at a training camp in Florida, but Sky Sports News state that Dahlkemper is currently in talks with City over a move which would see her travel to England once the international period comes to a close. The report states that Dahlkemper has been offered a 'multi-year' contract to move over to England, while Meg Linehan went into a little more detail and specified that City have offered two-and-a-half years to the defender. Should City get this deal over the line, it would represent yet another signal of serious intent from Gareth Taylor's side, who are looking to get their hands on the WSL title for the first time since 2016. City brought fellow World Cup winner Sam Mewis over from the Courage in August 2020, and they followed that up eight days later with a deal to sign yet another world champion, Rose Lavelle from OL Reign. They didn't stop their either, bringing in Lyon duo Alex Greenwood and Lucy Bronze, the latter of whom went on to be named The Best FIFA Women's Player of 2020 just a few months after her move to City. Despite those enormous signings, City find themselves third in the WSL, eight points behind leaders Manchester United with a game in hand.
