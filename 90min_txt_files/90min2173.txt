Franck Kessie has emerged as a transfer target for several clubs across Europe following his slow start at Barcelona, but the Blaugrana want to keep the midfielder at Camp Nou, 90min understands. The Ivory Coast international joined Barcelona on a free transfer over the summer after helping Milan to their first Serie A title in over a decade. He was one of the Rossoneri's standout players in their Scudetto-winning campaign, but has found game time harder to come by in Spain. While he played in all six of Barcelona's Champions League matches before the World Cup break, he's made just seven appearances so far in La Liga. 90min understands that Tottenham, who have a long-standing interest in Kessie, have made enquiries about the 25-year-old, while Aston Villa, Fulham, Inter and Napoli have also asked about his availability.
