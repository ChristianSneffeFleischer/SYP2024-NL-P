Chelsea manager Graham Potter has confirmed the club is yet to decide what the immediate future will be for new signing David Datro Fofana. The striker has joined the Blues from Molde, for whom he scored 22 goals in all competitions during the 2022 Norwegian season en-route to winning a league and cup double. Fofana represents part of Chelsea   s wider plans to recruit talented young players long before they reach their peak and develop them into superstars, dubbed    Vision 2030   . Competition for places at a club like Chelsea might ordinarily be tough for a 20-year-old with precious little professional experience. An immediate loan might still be an option to ensure he gets sufficient game time, but it is worth noting that Armando Broja   s season-ending injury has left the current Blues squad a little light at the top end of the pitch. Speaking to the media on Wednesday, Potter seemed to suggest all options remain open.    It   s too early to say. He   s an exciting player so we   re open-minded about it,    the boss explained.
