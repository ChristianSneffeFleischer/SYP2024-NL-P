Aston Villa are battling with Saudi Pro League outfit Al Nassr for the signature of France international winger Moussa Diaby, 90min understands. 90min revealed earlier this week that Villa made a second bid for Diaby earlier this week worth around    50m, and Bayer Leverkusen have now agreed to terms that also includes extra add-ons with the Premier League club. Leverkusen have given Diaby permission to talks with Villa, but also with Al Nassr who have also lodged a couple of bids for the player recently. The Bundesliga side have told Al Nassr that they do need to up their offer, which is seen as likely and means the ultimate decision will be left to Diaby himself. feed Villa have been working hard to try and land Diaby, with their new president of football operations, Monchi, involved in trying to seal a deal for the 24-year-old. Diaby's camp had indicated earlier in the week that a move to England with Villa was his preferred option, but Al Nassr are pushing hard as well and their contract offer to the winger is huge, clearly making it tempting for the France international to quit European football. Leverkusen are pushing Diaby to make a decision by the weekend as they want to move on with their own transfer plans ahead of the new season.
