Chelsea have confirmed the signing of England Under-21 winger Noni Madueke from Eredivisie club PSV Eindhoven as a busy January transfer window continues. Madueke was born in north London and started his football career in the academies at Crystal Palace and Tottenham, before joining PSV at the age of 16. It was reported at the time that he had turned down offers of professional contracts at both Spurs and Manchester United. The player has signed a seven and a half year contract at Stamford Bridge until 2030, with the option of an extra 12 months until 2031. Madueke was 17 when he made his first-team debut for PSV in January 2020 and had been an important first-team for the club since the start of the 2020/21 season. He is already Chelsea   s fifth new arrival of the winter window, following Benoit Badiashile, David Datro Fofana, Joao Felix and Mykhailo Mudryk to Stamford Bridge. The Blues have now signed 12 new players since Todd Boehly   s takeover in May 2022. Madueke is also the second player to swap PSV for the Premier League this month following Liverpool's recent capture of Netherlands forward Cody Gakpo.
