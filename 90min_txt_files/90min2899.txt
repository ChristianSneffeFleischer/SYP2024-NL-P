A number of clubs including Chelsea and Manchester United are monitoring Jamie Vardy's situation at Leicester City, 90min has been informed. Vardy's current deal is due to expire next year and new talks are yet to take place, and 90min has been told that a number of Premier League clubs are monitoring the situation around the 35-year-old - who bagged 17 goals last season. Among the clubs who have been informed about Vardy are Chelsea and Man Utd, both of whom are currently in the market for a new striker. Leicester need to sell some players to bring new faces in and stay within financial fair play regulations, but with Kasper Schmeichel moving to Nice and talks ongoing over the possible departures of Wesley Fofana and James Maddison, it remains to be seen if the Foxes would be willing to part with their talismanic striker. Leicester boss Brendan Rodgers indicated earlier this year that the club would assess Vardy's future this summer.
