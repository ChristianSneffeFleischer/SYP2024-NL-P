Leicester City manager Brendan Rodgers has again played down reports linking Wesley Fofana with a move to Chelsea as the centre-back is not for sale. 90min understands the Blues are keen on the young Frenchman and despite Rodgers already insisting that Fofana won't be sold, Stamford Bridge chiefs aren't being put off by this stance as it is similar to the one he took prior to Ben Chilwell's sale. Nevertheless, Rodgers has doubled down on his belief that Fofana will be staying at the King Power Stadium this season. "He   s not for sale," he began. "There is going to be interest in him, that   s the point. I had a long chat with him the other day.   When you are as talented as he is there   s going to be lots of speculation, but he   s not for sale. I   ve got no doubts that in future he   ll play on the highest stage but he feels good here and he   s very comfortable with his teammates. "When we signed him from Saint-Etienne [for  Â£31.5m in 2020] he had played only 26 games at senior level. Everyone had a look at him back then but he came here and flourished. He was happy to sign a new five-year deal in March. He has perhaps got an opportunity to get himself into France   s World Cup squad, which is about playing regularly, so I   m pretty calm on it. He   s very happy here." Listen now to 90min's Talking Transfers podcast, with  Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey,  Harry Symeou  &  Toby Cudworth.
