Cody Gakpo has admitted he 'thought about' Manchester United in the summer and would consider them again if they approached him once more. The Netherlands star was the subject of interest from United late in the summer transfer window with a move for Antony looking increasingly unlikely. However, United went back to Ajax and met their demands to get the deal done for the Brazilian, meaning a move for the Dutchman didn't materialise. He's since enjoyed a stellar World Cup campaign in Qatar and alerted top clubs to his services as a result, one of which is United once again. 90min understands United have been further convinced of his qualities as a result of his showings in the Middle East, with Erik ten Hag pushing for him to be signed. But Gakpo himself has broken the silence on the matter, revealing to Dutch outlet NRC:    I haven   t heard from Manchester United yet. If they come, I will think about it with God   s help." He added: "I thought about Man Utd last summer, but when that didn   t happen, I didn   t know anymore. Then Leeds arrived, I had doubts...now I wait and see."
