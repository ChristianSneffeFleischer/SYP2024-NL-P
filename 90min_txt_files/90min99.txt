The 18-year-old signed from Santos in his native Brazil back in July for a fee believed to be in the region of  Â£13m. Gabriel featured three times during Chelsea's five-match tour of the United States in pre-season but has now completed a move to Ligue 1. Strasbourg, who are managed by Patrick Vieira, were recently acquired by Chelsea's BlueCo ownership group, with other young summer signings expected to be sent on loan to the Stade de la Meinau before the end of the transfer window. feed 90min understands that Chelsea are working on a deal to sign Gabriel's former Santos teammate, Deivid Washington, and it is possible they reunite at Strasbourg. Chelsea confirmed an extended rejigging of squad numbers prior to confirmation of Gabriel's loan, with the winger not handed one ahead of the new season and suggesting a move away was close to being finalised. The Blues also revealed that they will be without Christopher Nkunku for the first few months of the season after he sustained knee ligament damage.
