CF Montreal's partnership with Bologna has paid dividends once again with the capture of center-back Gabriele Corbo on loan. The 21-year-old will remain with the Canadian side through the 2022 MLS season having spent the 2020/21 campaign on loan at Spezia in Serie B. Despite his young age, Corbo brings a decent amount of high-level experience to Montreal, with 26 caps for Italy under his belt at various youth levels. He's also played in Serie A three times and logged 745 minutes during his spell in the Italian second tier with Spezia.    We are delighted to have Gabriele on board for the upcoming season. He is a right-footed defender who can play in both a three-man and a four-man defense,    CFM sporting director Olivier Renard said in a statement.    In the past, he has even played a few games at right-back in a four-man defense. He is very happy to come here and already joined us several weeks ago. He is gradually getting used to his new work environment and his new city for 2022.    Corbo joins Lassi Lappalainen, Sebastian Breza, and Orji Okwonkwo on the list of players to join CF Montreal on loan from Bologna, with both clubs owned by Joey Saputo. English center-back Luis Binks went the other way, making 26 appearances for Montreal before joining Bologna, making his debut for the Italian side in September 2021.
