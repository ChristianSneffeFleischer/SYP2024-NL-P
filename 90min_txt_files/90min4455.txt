Lucas Vazquez has turned down the chance to join Atletico Madrid and is expected to sign a new Real Madrid contract.  Vazquez's current deal is set to expire at the end of the season, with reports throughout the campaign suggesting that he may leave on a free.  More recently, it seemed that a breakthrough was near and AS are now reporting that the versatile Spaniard is on the verge of agreeing a three-year extension. Atletico are believed to have sent over a proposal to Vazquez but he turned the offer down swiftly. Other than a brief spell with Espanyol he has been at Real since his youth team days and felt uncomfortable making the cross-city switch.  The breakthrough in negotiations came after  Los Blancos raised their offer from    3.5m to    5m-per-year. Now, it's said only a late breakdown in talks will prevent Vazquez remaining at the Santiago Bernabeu beyond the end of the season.  Milan are understood to retain a keen interest in the player and although they have presented a concrete offer to Vazquez, a move is looking increasingly unlikely. The player is even willing to accept less than the    5m currently on the table in order to stay at his boyhood club.
