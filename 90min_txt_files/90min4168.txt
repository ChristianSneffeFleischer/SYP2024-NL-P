Anderlecht starlet Albert Sambi Lokonga is set to be officially unveiled as an Arsenal player at the end of his quarantine period, after the two clubs completed all the paperwork on a transfer to the Emirates Stadium.  The Gunners have been working on this deal for some time, having seen an opening bid of  Â£13m rejected by the Belgian side. But Anderlecht have accepted an offer of    17.5m plus add-ons for the midfielder, who has signed a contract with the north London club that runs until June 2026.  Fabrizio Romano reports that the only thing missing in the deal is the official announcement, which will arrive once Lokonga has completed his period of quarantine, after flying from Belgium to England. He underwent a medical on Friday, and looks set to be confirmed as a new Arsenal player in the coming days.  Arsenal will be pleased to have got this deal over the line, as they were forced to fend off interest from two clubs in Italy for the young Anderlecht star. Coach Vincent Kompany has spotted plenty of potential in the midfielder, handing him the captain's armband, despite his 21 years of age.   Lokonga has impressed since becoming a regular in the Anderlecht side, featuring 27 times in the Jupiler Pro League last season. He became captain midway through the 2020/21 campaign, and has caught the eye with his all-action style.
