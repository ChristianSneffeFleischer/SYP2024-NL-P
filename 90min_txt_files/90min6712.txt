Newcastle midfielder Matty Longstaff is could be on the verge of a bizarre move to Udinese, after the Serie A side reportedly offered him a  £30,000-per-week contract - double the figure on the table from the Magpies. Longstaff broke into the Newcastle first-team setup earlier this season having graduated from the club   s youth system and enjoyed a dream Premier League debut last October, notching the winner in Newcastle   s 1-0 win over Manchester United. The 20-year-old is said to have been eager to extend his deal on Tyneside but has been unimpressed with Newcastle's proposals thus far. As a result his future at the club now seems uncertain, and Udinese have offered the youngster a substantial wage rise.  Sky Sports    north east reporter Keith Downie broke the news on Twitter, tweeting:    Matty Longstaff has been offered  £30,000-a-week to sign for Serie A side Udinese. The midfielder flew out to Italy before lockdown, where held talks over a five-year-deal. Longstaff wants to stay at Newcastle but Udinese   s offer is more than double that of Newcastle   s.    Udinese are reportedly not the only foreign club monitoring the situation of the Newcastle man, with Downie adding that a number of European giants were said to be watching on, though only one offer has been made at this stage.
