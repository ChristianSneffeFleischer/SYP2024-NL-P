Juventus forward Cristiano Ronaldo has refused to rule out the possibility of leaving the Italian side this summer. Both Ronaldo and Juventus are thought to be open to the idea of parting ways this summer ahead of Massimiliano Allegri's return to the team, with the likes of Manchester United, Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid linked with his signature. Publicly, Juventus have always stressed that Ronaldo has a place at the club, but the 36-year-old could not offer that same certainty when asked about his future in a press conference on Monday.    I have been playing at the highest level for many years, this doesn   t faze me," Ronaldo said (via The Express). "Maybe if I was 18 or 19 I might have had some sleepless nights, but I'm 36. "Whatever comes will be for the best, regardless of staying at Juve or being transferred. The crucial thing now is the Euros, it is my fifth Euros, but for me it   s like my first Euros." It was a notable moment in a press conference which got off to a really strange start. As Ronaldo sat down, his eyes locked on the two bottles of Coca-Cola, an official tournament sponsor, on the table in front of him, and quickly removed them. After rolling his eyes and saying 'Coca-Cola' with a disgusted tone in his voice, he then encouraged everyone watching to 'drink water' instead. When he was done preaching about the health benefits of water, Ronaldo discussed his ability to prolong his career at the highest level, insisting it's all about learning how to adapt to new situations.

"I   m more mature and if a player wants to play for many, many years then they have to be able to adjust.
