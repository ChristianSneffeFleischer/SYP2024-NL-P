Pep Guardiola has all but confirmed Manchester City defender Eric Garcia is set for a summer move to Barcelona. The Spaniard has featured fleetingly for City this season after making 20 appearances in all competitions last term, playing just four Premier League games this campaign. He was completely absent from the City squad that won Sunday's Carabao Cup final against Tottenham as Aymeric Laporte headed home eight minutes from time to secure a 1-0 victory and their fourth consecutive success in the competition. The 20-year-old's contract at the Etihad is due to expire this summer and he's been linked with a return to Catalonia for months now. Speaking post-match, Guardiola seemed to confirm the Spain international's imminent move to Camp Nou. He said, as quoted by Sky Sports: "I would love to have 15 Eric Garcias for the way he conducts his behaviour. He is always thinking of the team. He's always a good face in the good or bad moments. He helps the manager and the backroom staff all the time. "He will go in an incredible team and when the people say they are unsatisfied if I don't play, I think of Eric. It's a beautiful morning! ?? #ManCity | https://t.co/axa0klD5re pic.twitter.com/MlvTOfvIVl "Most of the time he's not on the bench because he's going to move to Barcelona, I hope so. It's tough, but it is what it is."
