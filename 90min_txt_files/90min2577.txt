Paris Saint-Germain coach Christophe Galtier has confirmed that midfielder Leandro Paredes has agreed personal terms for a transfer to Juventus. However, talks between the two clubs continue as they try to hammer out their own agreement. Paredes, who moved to Paris from Zenit St Petersburg in 2019 after initially making his name in Europe with Roma, has featured in all three of PSG   s Ligue 1 games so far this season. But the Argentina international has been dropped for the midweek clash with Toulouse because Galtier isn   t prepared to waste time on a player who may imminently be leaving.    Paredes will not be part of the squad,    the coach said on Tuesday.    I spoke with him at the end of training. He found an agreement with Juve. His head is elsewhere, the agreement between the clubs is missing. I made the decision not to put him in the squad so as not to have a player who may leave the club 24 hours later.
