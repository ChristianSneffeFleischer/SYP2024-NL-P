Eder Militao has made it clear to Real Madrid that he wants to sign a new contract at the Santiago Bernabeu and is not interested in leaving for Chelsea. Militao has been promoted to the starting lineup on a permanent basis this season following the departures of Sergio Ramos and Raphael Varane, and he has been among the team's best performers this year. That form has caught the eye of Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel, who has asked the Blues' board to explore the possibility of signing Militao. Marca note that Chelsea will soon hold a meeting with Militao's representatives to discuss a potential deal, but the 24-year-old has made it abundantly clear that his sole focus is on extending his stay in Madrid. Militao wants a new contract and Real want to tie him down to an extension, and although no formal talks have taken place just yet, they are expected to get underway soon and the feeling is that fresh terms will be fairly simple to thrash out. He is loving life at Real, enjoying working under Carlo Ancelotti and reluctant to switch clubs in a World Cup year, so the chances of him leaving Spain are seen as incredibly slim. While a move to Chelsea cannot be firmly ruled out, Militao will give Real every possible chance to get an extension done. Remaining at the Bernabeu is his priority.
