Wolfsburg have signed 19-year-old German international Jule Brand from Hoffenheim, with the teenager to join the She Wolves ahead of the 2022/23 campaign. Brand has put pen to paper on a three-year contract with Wolfsburg, committing herself to the European powerhouses until 2025. The winger still has one year remaining on her Hoffenheim deal, with Wolfsburg taking advantage of an exit clause in her contract to secure her services. However, details of the transfer fee have not been disclosed.    The people in charge at VfL really tried very hard to get me in our talks,    Brand told Wolfsburg's official club website.    Ultimately, the overall package at VfL Wolfsburg, who have been playing for titles both in Germany and in Europe for many years, absolutely convinced me.  "I think that this change is the optimal step for my further development. I am already looking forward to being part of this team from the summer and having a successful time with VfL!    Brand is regarded as one of the most exciting young talents in Europe, having burst onto the scene with Hoffenheim during the 2020/21 campaign. Her form saw her rewarded with her senior international debut in April 2021, aged just 18. Brand entered the fray against Austria on the hour mark, and within five minutes had already popped up with a goal and an assist.  The midfielder has been named in Germany's squad for the upcoming Arnold Clark Cup, where the national side will face England, Canada and Spain in a round-robin invitational tournament.  The 19-year-old has also impressed in this season's Champions League, netting against Arsenal during Hoffenheim's 4-1 victory over the Gunners. "Jule is not only one of the biggest and most sought-after talents in Germany, but also internationally," added Ralf Kellermann, Wolfsburg's sporting director.
