Jack Harrison is considering his future at Leeds United after they accepted a bid for him from Leicester City on deadline day, sources have confirmed to 90min. Harrison's current contract at Elland Road has 18 months to run, and Leeds previously rejected approaches from Newcastle in the hopes of extending his stay at the club. But with major outlays in January bringing in the likes of Georginio Rutter, Max Wober and Weston McKennie, Leeds decided to accept an approach for Harrison worth around  Â£20m from Leicester. 90min understands that Aston Villa and Newcastle also held talks on deadline day. The Foxes believed they were on course to sign Harrison, strengthening their wing options further after bringing in Tete from Shakhtar Donetsk, and the player even underwent a medical. However, Leeds pulled the plug on the deal, much to Leicester's annoyance after they allowed Ayoze Perez and Marc Albrighton to leave the club.
