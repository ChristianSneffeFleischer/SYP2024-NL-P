Barcelona have received two bids for French centre-back Jean-Clair Todibo, but they plan on taking their time to find the best possible offer before letting him go. The 20-year-old spent the second half of the season on loan with Schalke, who had negotiated an option to buy Todibo permanently but eventually declined to trigger it. The defender has now returned to Camp Nou, but is well aware that his time at the club is probably up. Barcelona are already looking for new centre-backs this summer, with Manchester City's Eric Garc  a high on their wish list, and according to Mundo Deportivo, the Spanish side are also searching for buyers for Todibo. The Frenchman is living in Barcelona again but sees his future away from the club, although the Catalans are in no rush to sanction his exit just yet.  They have received two formal offers for his signature this summer, but a decision will not be made until Barcelona have a clearer idea of where their pursuit of a new centre-back stands.   #ElClasico J-2 ???? #For  aBar  a A post shared by  Jean-Clair Todibo (@jctodibo) on Dec 16, 2019 at 11:12am PST The names of those suitors are unknown, although the majority of the speculation surrounding Todibo's future has involved Everton and Milan, who are both rumoured to see the Frenchman as an ideal signing this summer. There's also a mention of Leicester City; the suggestion is that those links come from local papers in England, but they actually come from Spanish outlet Sport (via Sport Witness). Ah, the fun of the rumour mill. Todibo is expected to cost close to  Â£22.5m, which would give Barcelona a significant profit on the six-figure fee they paid Toulouse to sign him in January 2019.
