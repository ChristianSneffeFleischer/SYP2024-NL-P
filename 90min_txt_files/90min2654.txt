Everton manager Frank Lampard has admitted he wants a definite answer on the future of midfielder Anthony Gordon amid significant interest from Chelsea. The Blues have indicated a willingness to spend up to  Â£60m on Gordon and are hopeful of getting a deal done for the 21-year-old, who was left on the bench for Everton's Carabao Cup victory over Fleetwood Town on Tuesday night. After the game, Lampard cooled suspicions that his team selection was a hint at a future transfer but the boss did admit he wants Gordon's future sorted as soon as possible. "Everyone knows there   s interest from Chelsea, it   s very public now, but he   s our player. It   s as simple as that," the Toffees boss said. "He was on the bench [because] he had a bit of an issue with his heel after the game against Forest, we kept him out of it completely unless he was absolutely needed tonight, I didn   t feel he was." Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey,  Toby Cudworth  and  Harry Symeou  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Antony attempting to push through a move to Man Utd, Frenkie de Jong and Pierre-Emerick Aubayemang's futures at Barcelona and Arsenal's interest in Pedro Neto.
