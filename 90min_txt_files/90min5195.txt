Juventus manager Andrea Pirlo was supposedly insistent that the Serie A champions turn down a 'monstrous bid' from Premier League side Leicester City for their promising centre-back Merih Demiral last summer. A legendary former player, Pirlo replaced Maurizio Sarri nine days after being originally appointed as manager of the club's Under-23 side at the end of last season. In his first ever managerial position, Pirlo has overseen an unbeaten start to Juventus' league campaign, with Demiral starting at the back in the club's last five domestic outings. ? ??????? ??????? ?#JuveCagliari #FinoAllaFine #ForzaJuve pic.twitter.com/xOgNP6MMes Having recovered from a serious knee injury at the turn of the year, Demiral has worked his way into Pirlo's regular starting XI thanks in part to the early season absence of Dutch international Matthijs de Ligt. Leicester had two sizeable bids for Demiral rejected during the previous January transfer window - before his injury - and were thought to have reignited their interest in the centre-back last summer. Leicester were so intent on securing Demiral's signature that they presented a bid described as a 'monstrous offer' by the Italian publication Calciomercato. However, Pirlo - who only took charge at the start of August - was adamant Juventus hold on to the Turkey international.
