Manchester City believe that Pep Guardiola   s new contract will greatly aid their pursuit of future targets including Jude Bellingham, 90min understands. Guardiola inked a new two-year contract at City earlier on Tuesday, extending his stay at the Etihad until 2025, after agreeing terms earlier this month. 90min previously revealed that City were always confident that Guardiola would sign his new deal, but to some extent it hampered talks with potential targets. High ranking agents have told 90min that some of their clients wanted to know the situation between the Spaniard and City, but a definitive answer was not forthcoming. However, with Guardiola's contract now signed, City   s impressive recruitment team are already well advanced with their plans for 2023 and beyond - and 90min understands that one player in their sights is England's Jude Bellingham. Borussia Dortmund are hopeful of keeping the 19-year-old for one more season, but if he is lured away, City believe they are well placed to win the battle for him - particularly with Guardiola at the helm. Scott Saunders  hosts  Graeme Bailey  in the latest episode of Talking Transfers, discussing Cristiano Ronaldo's interview and his future, Man Utd's interest in Cody Gakpo, plus the latest on Endrick and Rafael Leao.
