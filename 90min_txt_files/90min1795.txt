Borussia Dortmund boss Eden Terzic has urged Jude Bellingham to 'break the mould' and stay with the German club in the face of transfer interest from some of Europe's biggest clubs. There is a queue forming for the midfield wonderkid at present, with the likes of Liverpool, Manchester City and Real Madrid leading the case, as reported by 90min. Bellingham isn't the first Dortmund youngster to attract substantial interest, with the likes of Erling Haaland, Mario Gotze and Jadon Sancho all making big moves over the years following successful spells with the club. However, Terzic is hoping Bellingham will follow the path of someone like Marco Reus in staying with Dortmund, at least for a little while longer both to further develop the player and help the club's fortunes on the pitch. On this edition of Talking Transfers, Scott Saunders hosts Toby Cudworth & Graeme Bailey to discuss all the big transfer stories. This week's agenda includes Jude Bellingham, Harry Kane, Declan Rice, Hakim Ziyech, Leandro Trossard, Pedro Porro, Mykhaylo Mudryk and more!

In my first season [as interim manager], I was able to put Jadon, Jude and Erling on the pitch, but that was their only year together.
