Newcastle United have confirmed the signing of teenager Australian forward Garang Kuol. The 18-year-old arrived in England earlier this week, as 90min confirmed, and now he has put pen-to-paper on a long-term deal after completing his medical. 90min revealed earlier this month that Newcastle were in talks with Central Coast Mariners to seal a deal for the teenager, who was being chased by some of Europe's biggest clubs including Borussia Dortmund, and now they have confirmed the deal is complete. Kuol will now return to Down Under with the Mariners as he hopes to earn a place in Australia's World Cup squad, having made his senior debut for his country last week. Egyptian-born Kuol is due to arrive in England in January, at which point his work permit situation will be assessed - if he does not qualify at that point, he will be loaned to a European side until he does qualify to play in the Premier League. After signing for Newcastle, Kuol told the club's website: "It's unreal. As a young boy in Australia, the Premier League is the main thing that everyone watches but nobody actually thinks they'll reach those heights. To be one of those people, to be in the position I am, it's amazing. "Now that I've signed for Newcastle, I want to train hard, play hard, hopefully go to the World Cup and come back here." Sporting director Dan Ashworth added:    Garang is a very promising young talent and we are excited that he   ll be continuing his development as a Newcastle United player.
