Fulham have agreed a deal to sign Roma winger Justin Kluivert on loan with an option to buy, 90min understands. The Dutchman returned to Roma this summer having spent last season on loan with Nice, scoring six goals in 31 appearances. The Cottagers have had a busy summer already, bringing in Joao Palhinha, Andreas Pereira, Kevin Mbabu and Bernd Leno on permanent deals, while Manor Solomon and Shane Duffy have joined on loan. Kluivert is set to be their latest addition. 90min understands a medical has been scheduled and Fulham hope to wrap the deal up on Friday. His contract with Roma is expected to be extended until 2024 to ensure they maintain value. Should the 23-year-old succeed in the Premier League, Marco Silva's side will have the option to make the deal permanent. Kluivert first rose to prominence in 2017/18 with ten league goals for Ajax, resulting in an    18.75m move to Roma. However, he has managed only five Serie A goals for I Giallorossi across two seasons and has spent the last two terms out on loan with RB Leipzig and Nice. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  &  Toby Cudworth  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Erik ten Hag wanting to sign five players before the transfer window closes, and Man Utd's attitude to selling Cristiano Ronaldo.
