Barcelona have been described as    studying    ways that they might be able to reunite with Camp Nou icon Lionel Messi next year, having lost him to Paris Saint-Germain in 2021. Messi joined PSG as a free agent when his last Bar  a contract expired. Both parties had agreed to an extension, even though the seven-time Ballon d   Or winner had actually asked to leave in 2020, but the club   s dire finances meant they didn   t have the salary room to register it with La Liga. Speaking during the summer, Bar  a president Joan Laporta was adamant that the    Messi chapter isn   t over   . He said at the time:    I think it's our responsibility to try to...find a moment to fix that chapter, which is still open and hasn't closed, so it turns out like it should have and have a more beautiful ending.    As president of Barca, I did what I had to do [letting Messi go from a financial perspective]. But also as president of Barca, and on a personal level, I think I owe him.    Only days later, Laporta claimed,    We will make this aspiration a reality,    regarding re-signing Messi. Now, Mundo Deportivo has reported that Bar  a are exploring the ways they might reunite with Messi, and it doesn   t necessarily have to be as a player. The ideal route would be to sign him on a free transfer in 2023, although his PSG contract does include an option for another year to 2024. To return in a playing capacity, there must be enough salary room, which there obviously wasn   t in 2021, and he must also complement the new project being built by former teammate Xavi. He may have to accept a reduced salary and, turning 36 next summer, a reduced role on the pitch. The alternative if he decides to hang up his boots would be rejoining Bar  a as a global ambassador and representing the club off the pitch around the world. But this would only be secondary plan.
