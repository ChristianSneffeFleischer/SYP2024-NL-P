Real Madrid are closing in on the signing for Rennes and France midfielder Eduardo Camavinga, with only the final details of a proposed transfer now thought to be left unresolved. Camavinga burst onto the scene with Rennes in 2019 and already has two full seasons of first-team football in Ligue 1 under his belt, despite not celebrating his 19th birthday until November. Real have been long-term admirers of the teenager and now look set to land the player. 90min revealed earlier this month that Rennes had accepted that Camavinga, who is due to be out of contract at the end of the season, is unlikely to sign a new deal and decided to make him available for sale at potentially less than    46m - under half of an earlier valuation. Canal Football Club in France has reported it is close to being a done deal with Real. Negotiations appear to be in the final stages as the parties work on ironing out the remaining small details. After Real withdrew from negotiations with Paris Saint-Germain over Kylian Mbappe after failing to make any progress, Camavinga stands to be just the second new arrival at the Bernabeu after the free transfer of David Alaba in an otherwise quiet summer. 90min explained last October that Real have eyes on a triple swoop of French players. The plan was initially former coach Zinedine Zidane   s, having repeatedly asked the club hierarchy to sign Mbappe, Paul Pogba and N   Golo Kante, with Camavinga eventually replacing the latter in the plan. Even if Mbappe doesn   t arrive in Madrid before the transfer deadline, he is still on course to become a free agent next summer and can begin negotiating pre-contract agreements in January. The same is true of Pogba, who is in the final year of his contract at Manchester United and has been keen to explore all of his options before committing to a particular path.
