Sevilla sporting director Monchi has confirmed that Newcastle target Diego Carlos will not leave the club before the January transfer deadline next week. However, he didn   t rule the Brazilian leaving the club in the summer if a similar offer is made again. Newcastle were very keen on signing Carlos this month. But 90min had already revealed earlier this week that Sevilla are not entertaining offers and Monchi   s comments now confirm that news.    The Newcastle offer was a good offer, a respectable offer. I have to say that,    he told i news.    But the offer, our board and management team thought it wasn   t enough. It   s true that maybe it wasn   t the right time. It   s a difficult market to find a replacement for a player like Diego Carlos.    It   s a market that takes place over a very short period of time. Maybe if that offer comes along in the summer then things might have changed.    The implication is that in a less fraught transfer window, with more time and flexibility to secure a replacement, Sevilla would have been open to selling without a club having to trigger an    80m ( Â£66m) release clause. It potentially gives Newcastle hope should they wish to try again in the summer.
