JUST IN: Andre Onana on his way to the US. @ManUtdMEN pic.twitter.com/odCPdQ1Y2G Speaking Gazzetta dello Sport  ahead of finalising of his transfer to United, Onana stated his ambitions at Old Trafford. "Now I really want to start this new experience, exciting and with a coach who for me is a master. I will go to a great league and a great club, which has a huge history just like that of Inter: I will start from scratch and give everything every day to show the new fans who I am," he said. "The important thing is to be honest and always tell people the truth. I am a person who always wants new challenges. Playing in the Premier League and for a club like United is irresistible. "All parties wanted this to happen. But what matters is that if I had stayed, I would have been happy because I never had any problems at Inter."
