Paris Saint-Germain have enquired about the availability of Inter's Nicolo Barella ahead of a potential summer bid, 90min understands.  Barella arrived from Cagliari in 2019 and has quickly become one of Inter's best and most important players, winning Serie A, the Coppa Italia and two Supercoppa Italiana trophies to date. The Italian international was on the scoresheet recently as Inter coasted past Benfica 2-0 in the first leg of their UEFA Champions League quarter-final tie, and his consistent performances have alerted some of Europe's top clubs. Indeed, 90min understands that Ligue 1 giants PSG, whose wait for a first Champions League crown goes on after their last 16 elimination at the hands of Bayern Munich, have enquired about Barella's availability with a view to making an offer this summer. feed However, sources have told 90min that Barella is one of the few players that Inter have no desire to sell, despite needing to raise funds with player sales during the summer. The likes of Federico Dimarco have also been linked with a move away from the club, with 90min revealing in February that Manchester City retain an interest in the 25-year-old. In order to make a move for Barella possible, PSG are willing to include Leandro Paredes in any potential bid - although his form during a loan spell at Juventus has been far from impressive. 90min further understands that there's plenty of Premier League interest in Barella, whose representatives have previously tested the waters regarding a move to England's top flight. Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp is believed to be a long-term admirer of Barella, while Manchester City and Chelsea are also keeping a close eye on his potential availability. LISTEN NOW
