Newcastle United are hopeful that they will win the race to sign Sunderland starlet Chris Rigg, sources have told 90min. The 15-year-old is in line to receive his senior debut in the Black Cats' trip to Shrewsbury Town in the third round of the FA Cup on Saturday. Captain of England's Under-16 side, Rigg is being courted by the country's top clubs. Manchester City, Manchester United, Chelsea, Tottenham, Liverpool and Everton have all held talks over a potential deal for the highly-rated youngster. However, despite coming through the ranks at Sunderland, Rigg and his family are huge fans of bitter rivals Newcastle, and 90min understands the Magpies are in pole position for his signature. Sunderland realise they are fighting a losing battle to keep Rigg but hope the promise of immediate first-team football will help convince him to stay at the Stadium of Light a little while longer.

I watched him train today with the first team and do the game-prep, and I have to say he is really impressive," he said. "He's not a big, strong, physical, guy - he's quite slight - but he has a wonderful left foot and he is an incredibly competitive animal. I've seen him for 20-30 minutes in an U21 game against Southampton, and his potential looks enormous to me.
