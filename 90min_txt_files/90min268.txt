Fulham have rejected a  £50m bid from West Ham United for star midfielder Joao Palhinha, 90min understands.  The Hammers are in desperate need of quality midfield reinforcements this summer after selling their captain Declan Rice to Arsenal. Rice left the club earlier this month for a British record fee of  £105m, leaving West Ham with a gaping hole in their midfield but with a huge transfer kitty to help fill it.  West Ham have targeted Fulham's Palhinha as a perfect replacement for Rice thanks to his stunning 2022/23 campaign. In his maiden Premier League season, the midfielder completed nearly 40 more tackles and interceptions in the division as he guided the Cottagers to 10th place in their first year back in the top flight.  90min understands that Fulham rejected an initial approach regarding the 28-year-old's availability last week, and they have now seen a follow up approach and bid of  £50m also be rejected by the London club.  feed Sources have confirmed that Marco Silva's side are holding out for  £60m in order to sell Palhinha, but the Hammers are unlikely to go higher than the  £50m they have offered.  Alternatives option that West Ham have considered are Youssouf Fofana from Monaco, Manchester City's Kalvin Phillips, Everton's towering midfielder Amadou Onana and a potential loan deal with an option to buy for Denis Zakaria - who spent last season on loan at Chelsea from Juventus.  Without additions, David Moyes will be left with just Tomas Soucek and Flynn Downes as options deep in his Hammers midfield.
