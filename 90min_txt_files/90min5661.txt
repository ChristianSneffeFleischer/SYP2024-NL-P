Exclusive: West Ham lead the race to secure the services of Djibril Sidibe and bring the defender back to the Premier League, with Wolves and Newcastle also in pursuit. Sidibe spent the 2019/20 season on loan at Everton, where he made 25 appearances in the top flight. Toffees boss Carlo Ancelotti opted not to make the Frenchman's move to Goodison Park permanent, but the Premier League may not have seen the last of the 28-year-old. 90min understands West Ham currently lead the chase to secure Sidibe's signature, but Wolves and Newcastle are also eying up the defender. Sidibe   s current club Monaco are prepared to let him head out on loan again this season, but only if a permanent deal is included as part of the move. Everton had the option to purchase the player at the end of his loan spell, but opted to not take this up. The 2019/20 season was Sidibe   s first playing outside of his native France. The right back began his career with Ligue 2 outfit Troyes, before earning a move to Lille in 2012 after helping his boyhood club to promotion to the top flight. He joined Monaco in 2016 and enjoyed a stunning debut season with the club. Monaco won the French title for the first time in 17 years and Sidibe was an integral part of their success - being named in the Ligue 1 team of the year. The World Cup winner's contract expires in 2022, but he started Monaco's season opener against Metz and was praised for his display by boss Niko Kovac.
