Paris Saint-Germain have completed a deal to sign Achraf Hakimi from Inter and he is set for a medical on Thursday. Hakimi is one of the best right backs in Europe. He enjoyed a terrific 2019/20 campaign on loan at Borussia Dortmund from Real Madrid which attracted the Nerazzurri's attention. Since moving to San Siro he has been a key part of Inter's success. He managed seven goals and ten assists in 37 league appearances last season, helping his side regain the Serie A title after a lengthy wait. However, he is now set to move to PSG. Chelsea were also interested in Hakimi but the Ligue 1 side have long been in the driving seat, with RMC Sport's Mohamed Bouhafsi confirming that an agreement had been struck for the transfer recently. PSG will pay    60m ( Â£51.5m) for Hakimi, with the defender agreeing a five-year contract. Paris has always been his preferred destination and he will undertake his medical on Thursday with an announcement expected soon after. Inter would have preferred to keep hold of Hakimi but their dire financial situation took matters out of their hands. Scudetto winning manager Antonio Conte has already left the club due to the off-field turmoil and further departures are expected. Inter still need their senior players to agree to a paycut and even then, some of the title winners may have to be sold in order to raise funds. ??
