PSV Eindhoven are expecting Cody Gakpo to leave the club in January, sources have confirmed to 90min. Manchester United have led the chase for the emerging star in recent months. Gakpo was one of the first players highlighted back boss Erik Ten Hag when he took charge at Old Trafford, long before the much more recent departure of Cristiano Ronaldo. United remain firmly in contention, but no deal has been done and PSV are happy to talk to any interested parties. 90min understands there are others keen on Gakpo, who enjoyed a good World Cup with Netherlands in Qatar, helping the Oranje reach the quarter-finals. PSV director of football Marcel Brands has also now confirmed that Gakpo would be allowed to leave as long as they receive the record transfer fee for him - that means in excess of the    45m which they received for Hirving Lozano when he joined Napoli in 2019.  Listen now to 90min's Manchester United podcast, The Promised Land, with Scott Saunders & Rob Blanchette. In the latest episode they discuss Cody Gakpo interest, the emergence of Kobbie Mainoo & Zidane Iqbal, and the recent mid-season friendly against Cadiz.    You have to be realistic. When you talk about Cody's price tag, how many European clubs are able to buy a player of his calibre? Maybe ten or twelve clubs? You just need a player in that position and then also be able and willing to spend the money in January. We just have to see if it all happens,    Brands explained at a PSV fans' event on Monday evening.    It must be a record transfer for PSV anyway, so then you know which direction it is going. More than    40m in any case," he added.
