Barcelona manager Xavi has confirmed that the club are continuing to work on a deal to sign Sevilla centre-back Jules Kounde. Chelsea have an agreement over both personal terms and a  Â£55m fee with Sevilla but Kounde continues to wait for Barcelona to make their move, prompting the Blues to begin exploring other options. While Barcelona are yet to present a formal offer to Sevilla, they are working in the background to try and convince Kounde to make the move to Camp Nou, and Xavi remained tight-lipped when asked for a progress report. "I feel bad, but I still can't offer any progress," he told reporters. "The club is working to keep improving and have more competition. If we have something official to say, we will say it." Sevilla director Monchi had been looking to arrange Kounde's departure by Monday, but the player's desire to hang on for Barcelona's offer has complicated things. Sources close to the player have told 90min that he is keen to evaluate all the options available before making a final decision on his next move, with a switch to Chelsea by no means off the table even if Barcelona do lodge an offer. Xavi went on to discuss his methods when it comes to convincing players to join Barcelona, insisting the allure of Camp Nou does a lot of the hard work for him.
