The Blues triggered the  £20m relegation release clause in Adams' Leeds contract and the 24-year-old travelled down to London to finalise the terms of a move to Stamford Bridge, but negotiations have now collapsed. Sources have confirmed to 90min that Adams is now heading back to Leeds, with Chelsea no longer pursuing an agreement. The collapse in talks in the latest event in a hectic 24 hours for Chelsea, who find themselves embroiled in battles with Liverpool over both Brighton's Moises Caicedo and Southampton's Romeo Lavia. feed Chelsea's current focus remains Caicedo, with the Blues refusing to give up on the Ecuador international even after Liverpool saw a British record  £111m bid accepted by Brighton. While Chelsea have not yet improved their bid of  £80m, they continue to explore their options in the hope of convincing Caicedo to choose Stamford Bridge over Anfield. At the same time, Lavia remains a real option for both Chelsea and Liverpool. The former have the highest bid as it stands, offering  £48m for the 19-year-old despite Southampton's asking price of  £50m.
