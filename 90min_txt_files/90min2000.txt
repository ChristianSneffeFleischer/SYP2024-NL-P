Brighton midfielder Alexis Mac Allister has declared that he remains    really happy    with the Seagulls and in no hurry to go anywhere else amid interest from the likes of Juventus and Atletico Madrid. Mac Allister had already enjoyed a strong first half of the club season before heading to Qatar and then playing an important role for Argentina at the World Cup. It served to raise the 24-year-old   s growing profile even further, with 90min recently reporting on Juventus and Atletico Madrid both showing interest in his services. Mac Allister   s father and agent has hinted there have been enquiries made about the player, although Brighton chief executive Paul Barber has confirmed none have come to the club. Mac Allister himself has now spoken about his immediate future, telling BBC Radio Sussex that he is in    no rush to leave    the Amex Stadium. "I feel really good with this club and my team-mates, and everyone who works here," he said. "I try not to read too much. I always say I am really happy here and I don't have any rush to leave. I am focused on the next game with this club." 90min understands that, while Brighton are keen to keep their squad together, would be willing for a free of around  Â£50m in the event that formal offers are made.
