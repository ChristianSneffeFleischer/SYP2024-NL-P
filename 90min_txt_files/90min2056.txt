Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United have all held talks with Atletico Madrid over a possible loan deal for wantaway forward Joao Felix, 90min understands. Felix is free to leave Atletico this winter and 90min reported earlier this month that a number of sides had been offered the chance to sign the Portugal international, who joined for around  £113m in 2019. His representatives have spoken with a number of sides, including Arsenal, Chelsea and United, over a possible deal and sources have confirmed that those three sides have all expressed an interest in getting a deal done. The trio have all held talks in the last week, with Atletico prepared to agree to a loan departure for Felix, but one stumbling point has been Los Rojiblancos' desire to recover as much of their  £113m spend as possible. Indeed, the La Liga side are looking to insert a permanent transfer clause worth around  £100m in any deal for Felix which, as it stands, has proven problematic for Arsenal, Chelsea and United.
