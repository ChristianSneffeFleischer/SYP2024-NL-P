Luis Suarez has sought to take the bite out of his meeting with future Juventus teammate Giorgio Chiellini, as the Uruguayan edges closer to joining the Turin outfit from Barcelona. Six years ago, the pair were involved in an infamous World Cup encounter, as a seemingly innocuous tangle on replays actually confirmed that Suarez had bitten the Italian on the shoulder.  Vamosssssssssssssss grande equipo???? ?? #so  arjuntos #siemprepositivo A post shared by  Luis Suarez (@luissuarez9) on Aug 8, 2020 at 2:21pm PDT The incident eventually led to Liverpool selling the striker to Barcelona later that summer, after he was handed a four-month ban from all footballing activity for the remarkable incident. With new Bar  a boss Ronald Koeman informing Suarez that his services are no longer required at Camp Nou, his imminent departure has seen clubs line up to secure his services, with Juventus now frontrunners to do so with a deal that would earn the 33-year-old  Â£9m-per-year. As he closes in on a maiden Serie A venture, one thing has been gnawing away him that he has had to put straight. As per La Gazzetta dello Sport, he has phoned up the Bianconeri's club captain, Chiellini, to offer his apologies for his actions in Brazil. Initially joking about the altercation, Suarez then took responsibility, telling him: "I admit I was wrong, but I am a human being. Each player has his own style of play, his own character and this got me where I am now." According to Sky Italia, Andrea Pirlo's new side are growing increasingly confident of bringing the experienced forward in this summer. A move for Edin Dzeko was mooted, but they've turned their full attentions to Suarez, with their stance on the move considered 'calm'.
