Neymar has agreed personal terms with Saudi Arabian side Al Hilal as he inches closer to a move away from Paris Saint-Germain, 90min understands. The Brazil international was offered the chance to move to the Middle East earlier this summer when Al Hilal made him their top alternative to PSG teammate Kylian Mbappe, but Neymar initially rejected the offer. However, sources have now confirmed to 90min that Neymar has given his approval to joining Al Hilal, who are back in pursuit of the Brazilian after their attemps to land Napoli striker Victor Osimhen fell flat, and has agreed the terms of an eye-watering contract worth around    220,000 ( £189,000) per day. PSG, who have been looking for buyers for Neymar, have welcomed interest from the Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF) and are understood to have accepted a    90m ( £77.6m) bid from Al Hilal to get the deal done. All parties are now finalising a move which is expected to be formally completed in the coming days. feed Saudi sources have laughed off suggestions Neymar could be loaned out after joining Al Hilal amid rumours of potential interest from Barcelona. Neymar's expected departure is the latest event in a tumultuous summer for PSG, who also remain in talks with Al Hilal over the potential sale of midfielder Marco Verratti. Lionel Messi left on a free transfer to join Inter Miami and it appeared as though he would be followed out the door by Kylian Mbappe who, after confirming he did not plan to trigger the extension in his contract, was frozen out of the first team. After being omitted from Luis Enrique's first matchday squad, however, Mbappe was welcomed back into the squad and the 24-year-old is in line to make his first appearance of the season against Toulouse on Saturday.
