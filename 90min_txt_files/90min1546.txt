Erik ten Hag has confessed Barcelona midfielder Frenkie de Jong would 'strengthen any squad' in the world amid consistent links with Manchester United.  One of the longest transfer sagas of the summer window was United's pursuit of De Jong, who was seen by many to be key to the way Ten Hag wanted to set up his Red Devils side.  In the end, the deal never materialised and Man Utd opted to sign Casemiro instead - a signing that has proved to be a roaring success at Old Trafford.  On this edition of The Promised Land, part of the 90min podcast network, Scott Saunders & Rob Blanchette look ahead to Barcelona vs Man Utd in the Europa League, Casemiro's return, the race to buy the club & more.
