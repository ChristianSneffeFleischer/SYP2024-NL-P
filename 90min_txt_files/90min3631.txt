Major League Soccer clubs are getting their rosters in order as the clock winds down on the off-season. We've seen some outrageous transfers this window, with Italy's Lorenzo Insigne joining Toronto FC while Ricardo Pepi moved to Germany's FC Augsburg.  With only five weeks out from the 2022 season kick off, this is where things stand... Inter Miami signed goalkeeper Clement Diop for the 2022 MLS season, with a club option for 2023.  Diop joins the South Florida side after training with the team for much of 2021. Prior to officially signing, the goalkeeper played for CF Montreal for three-and-a-half seasons, where he helped the team win the 2019 Canadian Championship, starting four matches en route to the title.The France native kicked off his professional career at Amiens SC, starting for the reserve team for two seasons.     Cl  ment is an experienced professional and we   ve seen his talent firsthand as he trained with Inter Miami since September. We   re happy to have him officially join the team and add to our already strong goalkeeper group,    said Chief Soccer Officer and Sporting Director Chris Henderson.
