Chelsea have spoken with the representatives of Borussia Monchengladbach forward Marcus Thuram, 90min can confirm, with the Blues hoping to secure a January move for the Frenchman. Thuram is out of contract at the end of the season and has attracted plenty of interest from across Europe thanks to his return of ten goals in 15 Bundesliga games this season, which leaves him second in the league's scoring charts behind only Christopher Nkunku, who has agreed to move to Stamford Bridge in the summer. Chelsea had explored bringing Nkunku to the club in January to aid their goalscoring struggles, which have worsened following the injury to Armando Broja, and sources have now confirmed to 90min that they are looking at Thuram for some immediate help. 90min revealed in November that Thuram was on Chelsea's list of potential targets and his expiring contract has seen him move towards the top of their wish list, with the Blues' recruitment team sensing a potential bargain. With Thuram refusing to extend his contract with Gladbach, the German side are keen to agree to a sale this month and have welcomed Chelsea's interest, although the 25-year-old wants to explore all his options before making a decision. Thuram is not thought to have decided whether to leave Gladbach in January or the summer. As a free agent, he could attract more interest and perhaps a more lucrative contract, and so he is not yet set on an immediate departure.
