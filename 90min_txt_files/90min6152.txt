Milan have entered the race for Tottenham's Serge Aurier and have identified the Ivorian as their 'main target' for a new right-back this summer. With the Rossoneri failing to qualify for next season's Champions League despite a great run of form after the restart, the prospect of losing either Andrea Conti or Davide Calabria - their two favoured options at right-back - is genuine and the club will be in search of a replacement should either one of them depart. Fabrizio Romano reports that Milan have already opened talks with Spurs over a potential move, with a fee in the region of    12m to    15m being discussed. Aurier joined Spurs in the summer of 2017 as a replacement for Kyle Walker     who had joined Manchester City in a then record-breaking deal     but has failed to convince during his three-year stint thus far. While he's capable of producing moments of magic, the Ivorian's impulsive nature and uncanny knack of committing costly errors mean he certainly cuts a divisive figure - at best - among the Lilywhite faithful.  He almost left the club at the end of last season following a campaign in which he played second-fiddle to Kieran Trippier. But the Englishman's departure to Atletico Madrid in the summer convinced him to stay and the 27-year-old - who recently displayed tremendous courage to finish off the Premier League campaign despite the tragic passing of his brother - has enjoyed somewhat of a resurgence under Jose Mourinho following his arrival last November.
