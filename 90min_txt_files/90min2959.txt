Martinez was pictured arriving at Man Utd's Carrington training ground along with fellow new signing Christian Eriksen on Tuesday, and the club confirmed on Wednesday that the Argentine's transfer to Old Trafford is now complete. "I   ve been lucky enough to be part of successful teams in my career and that   s what I want to continue at Manchester United. There will be a lot of work to get to that moment, but I firmly believe that, under this manager and coaches, and together with my new team-mates, we can do it," Martinez told Man Utd's club channels. "I want to thank Ajax and their fans for all the support they gave me. I had an unbelievable time there but feel the moment is right to test myself in another environment. Now I am at the perfect club to do this. "It   s an honour to join this great football club. I   ve worked so hard to get to this moment and, now that I   m here, I   m going to push myself even further."
