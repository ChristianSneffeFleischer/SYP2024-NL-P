 Lazio have approached David Silva with a view to signing the Manchester City legend as a free agent when his contract expires next month, as they look to add experience to a squad that briefly challenged Juventus for the Serie A title this season. Silva has already played his last Premier League game for City and will leave the club in August after the restarted Champions League campaign is over. He has spent 10 years in Manchester, during which time he won four Premier League titles, two FA Cups and five League Cups.
