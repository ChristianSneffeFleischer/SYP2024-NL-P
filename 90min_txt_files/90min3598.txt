We're just over a month away from the start of the 2022 MLS season and the transfer market is getting really busy. Wednesday was particularly hectic. On top of Charlotte FC and FC Dallas making bids for DC United winger Paul Arriola - as reported by 90min - and Inter Miami signing Colombian Emerson Rodriguez, there was a host of comings and goings, as well as a long list of contract renewals. Fear not, 90min has you covered with a roundup of all the business. Welcome to the Mile High City!       We've signed Honduran midfielder Bryan Acosta to a two-year deal with a club option for an additional season. As one Acosta (Kellyn) leaves for LAFC, another arrives with the Colorado Rapids signing Honduran midfielder Bryan Acosta in the MLS Re-Entry Draft through 2023.The 28-year-old had spent the last three seasons with FC Dallas, contributing two goals and five assists in 60 appearances, and has 51 caps for his country to date.   We   re delighted to bring a player of Bryan   s quality to Colorado,    Rapids executive vice president and general manager Padraig Smith said in a release.    Bryan is a dynamic midfielder with experience within our league and at an international level. His power, technical play and ability on both sides of the ball will be an asset to our midfield. We look forward to welcoming him to our group ahead of the new season.   Acosta will add some more depth to the Rapids' midfield group following the departure of his namesake and Cole Bassett who, as revealed by 90min, is set to join Feyenoord. Oh Captain! Our Captain!@jacko_8 ain't going nowhere, we've signed him through 2024 ?#Rapids96 It wasn't just transfers that kept the Rapids busy on Wednesday.
