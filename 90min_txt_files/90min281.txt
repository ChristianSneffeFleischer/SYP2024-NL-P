Aston Villa have completed the signing of winger Moussa Diaby from Bayer Leverkusen for a club-record fee. Saudi Arabian giants Al Nassr were also interested in Diaby and entered into a bidding war with Villa but the 24-year-old declined a move to the Middle East in favour of linking up with Unai Emery at Villa Park. The deal is now complete and Diaby has already travelled to the United States to link up with his new team for pre-season. Villa are understood to have parted with over  Â£50m to sign Diaby, who becomes the Villans' new record signing. feed Diaby becomes Villa's third signing of the summer, following midfielder Youri Tielemans and centre-back Pau Torres in making the move to the West Midlands. It has been an expensive summer for Villa, who have relied on the experience of new director of football Monchi to help them land some high-profile targets and continue their push for European football next season. Diaby, naturally a right winger, enjoyed the most prolific season of his career last year. In 48 appearances across all competitions, the Frenchman racked up 14 goals and 11 assists, putting him back on the cusp of breaking into his national team. There will be a reunion at Villa Park for Diaby with fellow winger Leon Bailey, who left Leverkusen two years ago.
