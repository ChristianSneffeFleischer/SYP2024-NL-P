Exclusive: Wolves manager Nuno Espirito Santo is poised to put pen to paper on a new deal with the club before the 2020/21 Premier League season gets underway. Nuno has enjoyed remarkable success in the Molineux hot seat since his appointment in May 2017, guiding Wolves to an emphatic promotion from the Championship during his first season in charge.  He led his side to seventh the following season - the best finish in the top flight from a newly promoted side in nearly two decades - before repeating the feat during the 2019/20 campaign while simultaneously juggling Europa League football.  Nuno has just 12 months left to run on his current deal, and although he had always reassured Wolves that he intends to extend his stay, the Molineux top brass were beginning to get anxious as his contract ticked down. However, 90min understands that Wolves are confident that Nuno will sign his new deal before the Premier League season begins. The 46-year-old has agreed the terms of his deal, as talks have been ongoing since last year. The new deal is expected to be announced once Wolves' Europa League campaign concludes. Nuno's side are in the quarter finals of the competition, and play Sevilla for a place in the last four on Tuesday evening. This is the furthest Wolves have progressed in Europe since their run to the final of the 1972 UEFA Cup.
