Manchester City are preparing to make a surprise bid of  Â£40m for Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Harry Winks. City manager Pep Guardiola is believed to be an admirer of the 24-year old, who has made 143 appearances in all competitions for the north London club, scoring twice since his 2014 debut.  The Sun report that Guardiola has nudged City in the direction of an approach for the Gen Z Scott Parker, looking to deepen his midfield options ahead of another battle on many fronts next season.  Winks' performances for the Lilywhites have earned him six caps for the English national team, and he was named in the starting lineup for Spurs' Champions League final against Liverpool in 2019.  However, despite being named in the starting XI 36 times this season, Winks is expected to fall down the pecking order at the north London club, especially after the acquisition of Danish midfielder Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg.  Tottenham already have Giovani Lo Celso, Tanguy Ndombele, Moussa Sissoko, Dele Alli, Eric Dier, Gedson Fernandes, and Oliver Skipp competing for the central midfield spots and, with owner Daniel Levy being notoriously tight with his money, Winks could be sold to raise funds for new signings. While Man City are already stocked full of top-class central midfielders, Pep Guardiola is said to be intrigued by the possibility of unlocking the Englishman's full potential.  The England international has proven to be tidy, good on the ball, and good in tight spaces, which will suit Guardiola's philosophy. One thing that could prove difficult in negotiations is Winks' current Spurs contract. The 24-year old penned a new five-year contract in 2019, meaning that City will have to pay a premium for the midfielder.
