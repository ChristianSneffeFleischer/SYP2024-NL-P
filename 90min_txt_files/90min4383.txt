A second-placed league finish and an appearance in the last four of the Champions League is usually a good - maybe even fantastic - season for any club. But for Real Madrid, it is firmly classed as sub-par mediocrity. For this titan of the game, a trophy-less season just won't do. Indeed, 90min's end of season report card for Los Blancos awarded the side with a C- for their performance throughout the campaign: not entirely disastrous, but can do so much better. After what has felt like an inharmonious season with the occasional flash of brilliance (mainly from Karim Benzema), something needs to change. There is a reshuffling of the pack to be expected at the Santiago Bernabeu/Estadio Alfredo di Stefano and, in a transitional summer, here are some names that look set to leave the club along with their potential destinations.  A true legend of the club, it will be strange to see Marcelo turning out  for anyone other than Real Madrid after having appeared 528 times for them thus far. But all good things must come to an end, and Marcelo's Real career has run its course.The 33-year old's decline has been steady over the past couple of seasons but this campaign, a series of dire performances and his clear physical deterioration have signalled it's time to move on. Juventus has been touted as a possible destination due to his friendship with Cristiano Ronaldo, although a potential move to David Beckham's Inter Miami is seen as a more likely option.Potential destinations: Juventus, Inter Miami From a footballing legend to someone the Madrid fans will be delighted to see the back of. The club's record signing arrived two years ago for around    100m and has since played just 43 times for them. A series of injuries has kept Hazard from reaching the heights he did in his legendary spell in the Premier League and, after his inappropriately jovial behaviour after his side's loss to former club Chelsea in the semi-finals of the Champions League, he has been heralded as a super villain by Madridistas - probably time to leave.Being offered at a cut price, he might not be short of offers, but he should choose wisely if he wants to make the most of his remaining years.Potential destinations: Chelsea, PSG, Milan, Inter, Galatasaray Once one of the world's scariest and most electric footballers, Bale was frozen out by Real Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane.Despite being somewhat in and out of the side while on loan at Tottenham this season, the Welsh wizard has still registered 16 goals and three assists and has proven his quality when he's featured.Bale has revealed he'll only disclose his future plans after this summer's European Championships but, if recent reports are to be believed, an early retirement is more likely than a permanent switch to Spurs.Still, they say golf is the perfect sport for the retired.Potential destinations: Tottenham, MLS, retirement Once heralded as a future world-beater, Asensio has failed to live up to the hype that surrounded him in his early days. Now 25 years of age, the Spaniard has performed below expectation for a couple of campaigns and has most recently been left out of Luis Enrique's Spain squad for the Euros.With an overhaul of Los Blancos' squad expected, a move away to a club craving a touch of creativity could be a turning point in his career.Potential destinations: Arsenal, Juventus  If it were Real's choice, Varane would most likely be staying right where he is. However, after 360 appearances for Los Blancos, the World Cup winning centre-back has expressed his desire to leave in search for a new challenge.His decision would suggest that the defender requires a new league in which to perform to satisfy his hunger for competitiveness. He's been linked with a multitude of clubs over the course of his career and, still at just 28, you'd expect that to be the case this summer.Potential destinations: Manchester United, Chelsea, PSG When Jovic left Eintracht Frankfurt for Real Madrid for a reported    60m in 2018, the Serbia international was tipped for greatness with Los Blancos.No prizes for guessing it didn't turn out that way.After a haul of two goals in just 32 appearances, Jovic was sent back to Frankfurt on loan in January. Although a return of four in 18 has helped the club achieve European qualification (missing out on the top four by one point), being overshadowed so heavily by Andre Silva may not have convinced Real to give him a second shot.Although there may be a few suitors, a permanent deal at Frankfurt will be the likeliest outcome, given the vast interest in Silva this summer.Potential destinations: Eintracht Frankfurt, Arsenal, Everton, Lyon Another loyal servant to Los Blancos, Isco has featured 336 times since his arrival from Malaga all the way back in 2013.Despite some brilliant form over the years, a lack of impact under Zizou may have spelled the end of his time in the Spanish capital. With an excellent creative touch, he will suit any side looking for an out-and-out number ten and is actually tipped to join Sevilla by AS due to Julien Lopetegui's previous interest in him.Potential destinations: Sevilla, Arsenal, PSG, Milan Ceballos has enjoyed a decent (at best) spell on loan at Arsenal, notably tasting FA Cup glory in the 2019/20 campaign, but he's not going to be staying in north London.While there is still a slim possibility of being tested at Real Madrid once he returns from his loan at the Gunners, a move away seems the most likely option at this moment in time for the midfielder.Potential destinations: Lille, Villarreal, Real Betis
