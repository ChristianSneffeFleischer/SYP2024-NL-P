Arsenal are edging closer to the signing of Jurrien Timber from Ajax, sources have told 90min. The Gunners have made the Netherlands international one of their top targets for the summer transfer window. They view Timber, a right-footed centre-back that has played all across the backline and in midfield in the past, as a potential parallel to Oleksandr Zinchenko, who begins matches at left-back but tucks in centrally higher up the pitch. 90min reported last week that Arsenal had made an opening    35m offer for Timber, but this fell well short of Ajax's    60m asking price. Despite this large gap in valuations, the Gunners remained confident that they would come to an agreement with Ajax. And 90min understands that the Dutch side have dropped their asking price down to    50m, which is close to Arsenal's new bid worth    48m. feed Personal terms have already been agreed with Timber and there is growing expectation that a transfer could be finalised before the weekend. He was previously a target for Manchester United, who are managed by former Ajax boss Erik ten Hag. The Red Devils pursued a transfer for the defender last summer but couldn't get a deal over the line, instead focusing on the signing of Lisandro Martinez. Timber is in line to become Arsenal's second signing of the summer, following on from Kai Havertz, whose move across London from Chelsea is imminent. Arsenal are also expected to make a new offer for Declan Rice after West Ham knocked back their first two bids. Manchester City have similarly had an approach turned down.
