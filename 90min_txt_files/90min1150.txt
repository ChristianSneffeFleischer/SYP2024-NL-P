Al Hilal are confident they can persuade Lionel Messi to move to Saudi Arabia, but talks are continuing over a return to Barcelona, sources have confirmed to 90min. The 35-year-old is due to leave Paris Saint-Germain this summer on a free transfer after deciding against staying in the French capital. Messi is keen to move back to Barcelona, who are working hard in the background to make a deal financially viable, but Al Hilal have made him a huge offer should he not return to Spain. The Argentine is already an official ambassador for Saudi Arabia's tourism authority, and was recently suspended by PSG for making an unsanctioned visit to the country in the aftermath of the 3-1 defeat to Lorient. Messi's representatives have been speaking with Al Hilal officials in recent weeks and they have made him an offer which is understood to be worth more than    400m-a-year - which would make him the highest paid footballer of all time, surpassing the    220m-a-year that Cristiano Ronaldo is earning at Al Nassr. feed Sources have told 90min that while Al Hilal believe they are well placed to land Messi, talks are continuing with Barcelona, who are doing everything they can to take him back to Catalonia. La Liga need to authorise any new Barcelona contracts due to their financial situation and Joan Laporta is confident that their feasibility plans, which include their offer for Messi, will be approved this week. Messi, who is likely to wait until the end of the 2022/23 season before finalising his next move, was named Sportsman of the Year at the Laureus World Sport Awards on Monday.
