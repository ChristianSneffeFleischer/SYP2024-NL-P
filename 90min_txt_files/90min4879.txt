Aston Villa are closing in on the signing of Morgan Sanson after agreeing a  £15.5m fee with Marseille for the midfielder. Sanson is entering the final 18 months of his deal with the French outfit, and has been linked with a move to Villa in addition to Premier League rivals Arsenal, Tottenham, Wolves and West Ham.  Villa have already had a    13m ( £11.5m) bid plus    3m for the 26-year-old rejected by Marseille, which manager Andre Villas-Boas branded 'very, very weak'. However, 90min have been told that the Villans have come back and agreed an improved fee of  £14m (   15.7m), potentially rising to  £15.5m, with Marseille. Sanson is to arrive in Birmingham next week to complete the move. Speaking on Wednesday after Marseille's 1-0 loss to Lens, Villas-Boas confirmed Villa had made a bid for Sanson, but added that it was way off the mark.    We had a very, very weak offer from Villa which we turned down," the former Chelsea boss said (via Birmingham Live). "It was pathetic. I hope that he [Sanson] continues to remain professional.    A post shared by MS8 (@morgansanson) Sanson predominantly operates as a number eight and has made 12 Ligue 1 appearances for Marseille this season, chipping in with two goals and three assists. The French midfielder has been at Marseille for four years having joined from Montpellier for    9m in January 2017.
