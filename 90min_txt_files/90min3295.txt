Chelsea have announced that they have activated an extension clause in Billy Gilmour's contract, tying him to the club until 2024. The 21-year-old's deal was set to expire at the end of the 2022/23 campaign, but Chelsea have moved to extend his contract by a further year. The Scot joined the Blues after turning 16 back in 2017 and impressed plenty at youth level. He was handed his senior debut by Frank Lampard during the 2019/20 season and put in some great displays, notably picking up man of the match awards against Liverpool and Everton prior to the pandemic.
