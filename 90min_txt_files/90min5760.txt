Atletico Madrid midfielder Saul Niguez has expressed his delight at being frequently linked with a move to Manchester United. Saul has been linked with a move to Old Trafford in virtually every transfer window in recent seasons, with former United defender Rio Ferdinand previously heaping praise onto the midfielder. A move has never materialised, however, and is unlikely to following United's signing of midfielder Donny van de Beek. ? VAN ?       DE              BEEK       Welcome to United, @Donny_Beek6! ?#MUFC Speaking to Spanish newspaper Marca, Saul expressed his gratitude towards the constant links to United, describing them as 'very positive'.  "I am very flattered that a club like Manchester United, or other teams that ask about me, take me into consideration," he began. "And important people from those clubs [such as Ferdinand] speaking well of me means that I am doing things well at Atletico Madrid". Following United's  Â£39m signing of Van De Beek and their desire to bring winger Jadon Sancho to the club before the 5 October deadline, a move for the Atletico man now seems highly unlikely, if it was ever that likely in the first place. Saul was linked with a move to United as recently as this summer when a cryptic countdown on his Twitter account suggested that he would be announcing his 'new club', alluding to a potential transfer. ?

Obviously.
