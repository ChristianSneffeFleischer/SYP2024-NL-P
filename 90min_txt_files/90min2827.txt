RB Leipzig are close to agreeing a deal to sign Red Bull Salzburg striker Benjamin Sesko in 2023. The 19-year-old has earned rave reviews for his performances in Austria, scoring five times in the Bundesliga last season, and a number of top clubs around Europe have been scouting him in recent months. 90min revealed in late July that Salzburg were standing firm with their intention to keep Sesko, who has attracted interest from Manchester United, Newcastle and Wolves, as well as Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund. However, it is Salzburg's sister club Leipzig who are now close to bringing Sesko to Germany as they continue their aggressive approach to the summer transfer market. Xaver Schlager and David Raum have already been signed to strengthen their squad, while Timo Werner is also expected to return to the club following a largely unsuccessful spell at Chelsea. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  &  Sean Walsh  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Chelsea's plans to sign Wesley Fofana. There's the latest on James Maddison, Jamie Vardy, Cristiano Ronaldo and Frenkie de Jong, and chat on Diogo Jota's new deal and Roberto Firmino's Liverpool future.
