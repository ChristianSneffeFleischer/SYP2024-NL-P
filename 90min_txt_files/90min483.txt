Christian Pulisic is set to become the second Chelsea player to join AC Milan this summer after the two clubs agreed a fee for his transfer, 90min understands. The American winger had received an approach from Ligue 1 side Lyon but was solely focused on moving to Milan, with Chelsea recently agreeing to drop their asking price to encourage a second bid from the Rossoneri. Sources have now confirmed to 90min that an agreement has been reached over a fee which is understood to sit around the  £20m mark, including bonuses, to take Pulisic to San Siro this summer. Milan agreed personal terms with Pulisic earlier this month and are now set to close the deal in the coming days. The two clubs have already done business this summer, with Ruben Loftus-Cheek making the move in June, and now Pulisic is set for a reunion with both the midfielder and Chelsea academy graduate Fikayo Tomori. feed A medical has now been scheduled for Pulisic who, if all goes to plan, will see his four-year association with Chelsea come to an end this summer. Pulisic joined Chelsea in January 2019 for a fee of  £58m, remaining with Borussia Dortmund for the next six months before eventually moving to Stamford Bridge, but the 24-year-old has struggled with both form and fitness during his time in London. He has managed 145 appearances in all competitions, chipping in with 26 goals and 21 assists, but rarely saw an extended run of starts. Pulisic, whose Croatian passport helps Milan meet their non-EU rules, enjoyed an excellent post-lockdown streak in the second half of the prolonged 2019/20 campaign, bagging four goals and four assists in nine outings, and will now hope to bring that form to Milan.
