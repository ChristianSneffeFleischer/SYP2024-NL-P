Manchester United are reported to have entered the running for Ben Chilwell this summer, striking a serious blow to Chelsea's hopes of landing the Leicester defender.  Being of a good age and, crucially, English, Chilwell is one of the most coveted players in the Premier League at present. 90min reported in June that Manchester City were interested, though Chelsea have remained the constant factor throughout the long-running saga.

They are said to have recently quoted Chelsea  £80m, although the Stamford Bridge hierarchy aren't keen to budge on their 'much lower' offer.  This could, allegedly, open the door to United. The Mirror claim that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side have entered the running for the England left-back, and are keen to reunite him with former teammate Harry Maguire.  Maguire joined United last summer for a record  £80m, and although he has had his critics, he has seriously improved a questionable United defence - captaining them to a third-place Premier League finish and the semi-finals of the Europa League.  There is evidently a feeling Chilwell could offer a similar improvement, but it's unclear how willing United would be to invest heavily in a left-back - a position in which they are fairly well stocked - when other areas of the team are in greater need of improvement.
