Barcelona midfielder Ivan Rakitic has once again moved to pour cold water over the speculation surrounding his future in Catalunya, saying there is 'nothing to talk about' regarding a potential exit this summer.  The Croatian is under contract until 2021 but has long been expected to leave ahead of time, with Inter and former club Sevilla among those most prolifically linked.   Much to the disappointment of the Spanish press, who seem determined to make a story out of his potential exit, however, he has rarely been interested in discussing a potential move.  What an emotional and historic moment! Already 5 years! Hungry for more! ?? pic.twitter.com/2mIYSBdEBi This was again the case this weekend, when he told Croatian news outlet Tportal: "Ten or 15 days ago I talked to the club and the conclusion is that I have nothing to talk about because I have a contract until summer 2021 with Barcelona and it's the club I want to be with and play for.  "Besides, my wife and daughters are fine in the city. There is no reason to think about other things. I am training well and I am sure that I will be at Barcelona for a long time." Speaking to Mundo Deportivo in April, the 32-year-old expressed frustration at the headlines surrounding him, accurately claiming that he 'is not a bag of potatoes'.   G   L DEL D  A!? Hoy hace 5 a  os...? Final de la @LigadeCampeones ? @ivanrakitic ? pic.twitter.com/fkGnsYSfM5 "I am not a bag of potatoes," he said. "I will decide my future. As I always said, being able to play at Bar  a is the perfect place. What I want is to enjoy and help the team.
