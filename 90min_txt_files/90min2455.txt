Scouts from more than half of the Premier League were in Glasgow on Wednesday to watch Ukraine, 90min understands, with Shakhtar Donetsk winger Mykhaylo Mudryk the main target of their interest. 21-year-old Mudryk, a target for Brentford earlier this year, has taken Europe by storm over the past year, with his performances in this season's Champions League against RB Leipzig and Celtic only boosting the interest in his services. A number of Premier League sides have expressed an interest in Mudryk - Everton failed with a    30m bid during the summer - and now sources have confirmed to 90min that numerous scouts were dispatched to watch the Ukrainian in action on Wednesday against Scotland. Centre-back Mykola Matvienko, also of Shakhtar, and Dynamo Kyiv winger Viktor Tsygankov were also being watched closely, but it is understood that the vast majority of suitors were there to take in Mudryk. Indeed, scouts from Arsenal and Chelsea were at Hampden Park solely to get a closer look at Mudryk. Members of the recruitment departments from Brentford, Brighton, Everton, Leeds, Newcastle, West Ham and Wolves were all in attendance on Wednesday, while a number of unnamed clubs were also represented in the stands. It is understood that most clubs were keeping an eye on Mudryk but Matvienko - a long-term Premier League target - and 24-year-old Tsygankov are also on the radars of a number of sides from England's top flight.
