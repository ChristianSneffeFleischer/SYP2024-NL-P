Chelsea midfielder Jorginho has not spoken to former manager Maurizio Sarri over the past 12 months, despite speculation linking the pair with a reunion at Juventus. The 28-year-old played under Sarri at Napoli before following him to Stamford Bridge in the summer of 2018, helping the Italian win his first piece of silverware as a manager last season as Chelsea scooped the Europa League. Ever since Sarri departed for Juventus at the beginning of the season, there has been incessant speculation linking Jorginho with a return to his homeland. But, despite the ongoing speculation, The Athletic report that the pair 'have not communicated' at all for the past twelve months, adding that Jorginho has 'fallen in love' with London and is keen to continue proving his doubters in England wrong. Jorginho was heavily criticised during his first season for the west London club, with fans bemoaning the monotonous nature of the much talked about 'Sarriball' - which frustrated and entertained in equal measure.  But this season, he has been a vital part of Chelsea's push towards Europe and has become a strong leader in a young dressing room, further highlighted by his appointment as vice-captain.  Despite an upturn in form and appreciation, it is believed that Chelsea would listen to offers for the Brazilian-born maestro. A swap deal is far more likely at the present time, though - with finances across the globe impacted by the coronavirus - so any move to Turin may have to include Miralem Pjanic, who is the only like-for-like replacement at Juventus who has been linked to the deal.
