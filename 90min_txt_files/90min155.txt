Burnley are locked in talks with Arsenal over a move for Belgian midfielder Albert Sambi Lokonga, 90min understands. Lokonga joined from Anderlecht in the summer of 2021 for a fee of around for around  £18m but has struggled to find his place at the Emirates and ended last season out on loan with Crystal Palace. Now back with Arsenal, the 23-year-old picked up an injury which prevented him from travelling with the squad for their pre-season campaign, only adding to the frustration surrounding his time in north London. Arsenal are open to parting ways with Lokonga and sources have confirmed to 90min that Burnley have explored a move for the midfielder. The newly promoted side are looking to land Lokonga's signature on a season-long loan deal which would include an obligation for a permanent transfer next summer. feed Lokonga has managed 39 appearances for Arsenal but has seen competition for midfield minutes ramped up by the expensive signings of both Declan Rice and Kai Havertz for a combined  £170m this summer. Thomas Partey has also been welcomed back into Arsenal's squad after initially being given permission to explore interest from Saudi Arabia, while the Gunners remain interested in signing 23-year-old Brazilian Bitello from Gremio. As a result, Lokonga is one of a handful of first-team players over whom tough decisions will need to be made in the coming weeks. Striker Folarin Balogun could be sold after a  £50m price tag was placed on the United States international's head, while the likes of Nuno Tavares and Nicolas Pepe are expected to depart.
