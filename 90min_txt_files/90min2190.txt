Wolverhampton Wanderers have held talks with Atletico Madrid over a double deal to sign both Matheus Cunha and Felipe, 90min can confirm. Manager Julen Lopetegui arrived at Molineux in November following the departure of Bruno Lage and is now exploring ways to bolster his squad to aid their fight against relegation. Wolves currently sit bottom of the Premier League, four points from safety. Lopetegui identified both Cunha and Felipe as possible targets and sources have confirmed to 90min that Wolves have held talks with Atletico over both players moving to England in the January transfer window. Both players have been told they are free to leave Atletico after a turbulent first half of the La Liga season saw Diego Simeone's side fall well behind in the title race and left them battling for a spot in next year's Champions League. 23-year-old Cunha, who has failed to score in 17 appearances for Atletico this season, has attracted significant interest from across Europe but agent Jorge Mendes is working to move Wolves to the front of the queue for his signature. Aston Villa, Crystal Palace and Everton have all expressed an interest in Cunha, whose transfer is expected to be an initial loan deal with a view to a permanent move.
