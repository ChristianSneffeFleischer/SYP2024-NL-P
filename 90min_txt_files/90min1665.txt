The Premier League may be the land of unlimited funds, but that doesn't stop the savvy operators working at the top from negotiating cut-price deals for players that'll join their club on a temporary basis. The January transfer window is the opportune time for loan deals to be struck. Perhaps injuries have decimated key areas and a short-term solution must be found, or maybe that exciting young prospect is in need of regular first-team minutes? There are many reasons why even the richest clubs dabble in the loan market, and here's everything you need to know about such deals. A loan deal involves a player joining another club on a temporary basis. At the end of the loan, the player in question will return to their parent club. Loan deals are typically short-term. There are situations where an emergency loan could last just a couple of weeks, but the shortest loans are usually six months (January to the summer).  Season-long loans are common, while some players join clubs on two-year loans. Of course, and such deals are becoming increasingly prominent. To spread out costs or delay payments, clubs like to strike loan deals that includes an option or obligation to buy.  An option clause means clubs essentially get a trial run with the loan player in question, as they can decide whether to sign the player permanently. An obligation means the club will purchase the player permanently at the end of their contracted temporary stint. These moves are particularly popular in Serie A. Loan players are not allowed to play against their parent club in the Premier League, but they can compete against them in domestic cup competitions. However, they are not allowed to feature in any domestic cup clash if they've already competed in the competition for another club.
