Tottenham are ready to include Harry Kane in key decisions over the club   s future as they bid to tie him down to a new contract, sources have confirmed to 90min. The striker's current deal expires in 2024, and though Spurs have long been keen to tie the England striker down to a new one, an agreement has not yet been reached. 90min has previously reported that Bayern Munich and Manchester United would be interested in signing Kane this summer. Tottenham's season has unravelled over the last couple of weeks - they were dumped out of the FA Cup by Championship side Sheffield United before limply exiting the Champions League to AC Milan. The future of head coach Antonio Conte, whose contract expires in the summer, is now increasingly uncertain. Parts of the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium crowd notably booed his negative substitutions late in their aggregate defeat to Milan before chanting the name of former manager Mauricio Pochettino. READ NEXT manual 90min reported earlier this week that Conte is likely to leave Tottenham, with Pochettino open to a spectacular return to the club. Sources have now told 90min that Kane is set to hold talks with chairman Daniel Levy towards the end of this season, with Spurs desperate to convince Kane to stay in N17.
