Leicester City manager Brendan Rodgers is to target two new strikers in the summer if the club qualifies for next season's Champions League. The Foxes are flying high in the Premier League this season - predominantly thanks to Jamie Vardy's league-high 21 goals - and despite a recent blip in form, are favourites to secure a position at Europe's top table. But despite Kelechi Iheanacho netting in his last two games for the club, Rodgers is aware that he'll need to further his talent pool if the Foxes are to cope with the physical demands that extra fixtures will bring.  "There's no doubt we need more options going forward." Rodgers told his pre-match press conference (via the Telegraph), ahead of Leicester's clash with Arsenal. "If we have European football next season it will increase the number of games and of course we'll then need to improve the squad for that. Our recruitment team are looking at targets and options for us to improve the squad." Vardy is now 33 years of age and although the former England striker has showed no signs of slowing down, he'll need to be rested at times if the 2015/16 Premier League champions are to compete on four fronts next season. The Telegraph's report further identifies Rodgers' desire to add another winger to his squad too, to provide competition for Harvey Barnes, Ayoze Perez, Marc Albrighton and Demarai Gray.
