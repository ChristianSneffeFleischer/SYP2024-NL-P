Carlo Ancelotti has said Isco is a 'fantastic' player, but added that speculation linking the Real Madrid star with a move to Everton is the least of his worries at the moment.  Ancelotti has not been shy about raiding his former clubs for talent to bolster his ranks during his time on Merseyside.  The additions of Allan from Napoli and James Rodriguez from Real have helped turn a struggling mid-table side into one pushing for Champions League qualification, and with Isco out of favour at the Bernabeu, The Mirror reported over the weekend that he is keen to reunite with Ancelotti once the January transfer window opens.  What an addition to an already strong squad this would be! ? The Italian, however, says he only has eyes for the task directly in front of him, as he looks to pick his side up from back to back Premier League defeats. "Isco is a fantastic player and [I have] a fantastic memory of him but now I am not, honestly, focused there," Ancelotti told reporters after Sunday's loss to Newcastle.  "I am focused on an important week we are going to have to recover players and to be well prepared for the game against Manchester United." ? | "It was not a good game."@MrAncelotti's #NEWEVE verdict... pic.twitter.com/qRD4CRJA2M
