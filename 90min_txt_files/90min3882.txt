Manchester United will not sign a midfielder before Tuesday night's transfer deadline, with their summer business concluded following the arrival of Cristiano Ronaldo. United confirmed the return of their former hero on Tuesday morning, on a two-year deal with an option for a third. Ronaldo joins Tom Heaton, Jadon Sancho and former Real Madrid teammate Raphael Varane as new arrivals at Old Trafford this summer. The club were interested in signing a central midfielder, with the likes of Ruben Neves, Saul Niguez and Eduardo Camavinga considered at points throughout the summer. However, Camavinga has joined Real Madrid on a six-year deal on deadline day, while Atletico's Saul is set to join Chelsea on loan. Neves, meanwhile, is likely to stay at Wolves. United fans consider the team light in that department, but according to various sources close to the club they will not address the position at this time. Paul Pogba, Fred, Nemanja Matic, Scott McTominay and Donny van de Beek are the players who are expected to compete for the positions over the first half of the season at least.
