Tottenham have announced the signing of Israel international Manor Solomon from Shakhtar Donetsk, following on from his loan at Fulham last season. Final completion of the deal remains subject to international clearance and securing a new work permit, but the 23-year-old forward has agreed a long-term contract until 2028. Solomon had been making an impact in the Israeli Premier League from the age of 17, before heading to Ukraine with Shakhtar in 2019. He was then able to join Fulham on loan due to a ruling by FIFA that allowed foreign players suspend their contracts owing to the ongoing Russian invasion. The same ruling has also now allowed Solomon to join Spurs on a free transfer, although Shakhtar have been left angered, claiming it has cost them substantial income. Solomon missed several months of last season as a result of a knee injury, but recovered to become a regular part of a strong Fulham team that impressed by finishing in the top half of the final Premier League table     he even scored in four successive games across February and March.
