Liverpool forward Divock Origi could leave the club on loan in January in a bid to find regular first-team minutes ahead of next summer's Euros.  The arrival of Diogo Jota from Wolves has thrust the Belgian even further down Jurgen Klopp's pecking order this term, with Origi yet to feature for the Reds in the Premier League six games into the 2020/21 campaign. Two of his three appearances have arrived in the League Cup while the other came in the 2-0 victory over FC Midtjylland in the Champions League on Tuesday night. Thus, with the 25-year-old potentially as low as sixth choice in Klopp's attacking pecking order, Belgian news outlet Voetbal 24 reports 'it's possible that Origi will change clubs in January' in a loan deal as he attempts to work his way back to the forefront of Roberto Martinez's plans for the national team with the Euros fast approaching. The Liverpool man wasn't included in Belgium's squad for the September international break and failed to register a single minute in the Red Devils' October Nations League fixtures despite receiving a call-up. Voetbal Nieuws claims that should Origi depart Anfield in the next transfer window, Belgian giants Club Brugge may well be his potential destination. Brugge were also linked with a move for the striker in the summer. However, with Origi    completely sidelined    at Liverpool, the Jupiler Pro League outfit have an    excellent chance    to make an effort in signing the striker in January.  A switch of such kind would perhaps be a wise one from the player's perspective, with minutes almost guaranteed throughout the second half of the season ahead of the Euros.
