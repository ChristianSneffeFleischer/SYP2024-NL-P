Manchester United are considering a number of targets, including Yann Sommer and Asmir Begovic, as they look to add another goalkeeper to the squad. United saw Lee Grant opt to retire at the end of last season and allowed Dean Henderson to join Nottingham Forest on loan in pursuit of first-team football. But it has left Tom Heaton as the only cover for first choice stopper David de Gea. 90min revealed last Friday that Southampton goalkeeper Alex McCarthy, who has lost his place on the south coast this season, is also a potential option on the radar. Now, the club is also looking at Sommer and Begovic as they weigh up a number of contenders. 33-year-old Sommer has considerable experience at the highest level, having played in the Champions League with both Basel and Borussia Monchengladbach     including appearances against United, Chelsea, Manchester City, Barcelona, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Juventus. He has also been to two World Cups and two European Championships with his country. Begovic, who recently turned 35, is well known to Premier League after making his debut for Portsmouth way back in 2009 and going on to play for Stoke, Chelsea, Bournemouth and Everton. The Bosnia & Herzegovina international   s most recent full season as a top flight starter was the 2017/18 campaign with Bournemouth. Prior to joining Everton in 2021, he also had short-term loans at Qarabag in Azerbaijan and at AC Milan.
