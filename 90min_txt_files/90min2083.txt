A number of Premier League clubs have been offered the chance to sign Tete on loan with a view to a permanent deal, 90min can reveal. The 22-year-old is technically contracted to Ukrainian giants Shakhtar Donetsk, but has spent the last six months at Lyon after FIFA suspended the contracts of all foreign players in Ukraine as a result of Russia's invasion. The system was extended into the 2022/23 season, allowing Tete to continue his career in France, but 90min understands that a move in the January transfer window is in the offing. Laurent Blanc, appointed as Lyon's manager in October following the dismissal of Peter Bosz, intends to take the Ligue 1 giants in a different direction, and Tete, who has scored five goals in 13 appearances this season, will be allowed to leave the club as a result. Listen now as  Scott Saunders  hosts  Graeme Bailey  and  Toby Cudworth  in the latest episode of Talking Transfers. This week they discuss Man Utd   s ongoing interest in Dutch duo Cody Gakpo and Frenkie de Jong, Josko Gvardiol   s future, Gabriel Martinelli and more! Available on  all audio platforms.
