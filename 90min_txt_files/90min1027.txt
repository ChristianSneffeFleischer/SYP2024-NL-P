Manchester City have made the first move in an attempt to sign Chelsea midfielder Mateo Kovacic this summer, 90min understands. Kovacic joined Chelsea from Real Madrid in 2018, initially on loan before completing a permanent transfer for a fee in the region of  Â£40m. The Croatian has won four trophies with the club, including the Champions League in 2021, and has played over 200 games. But his contract is due to expire next year. 90min explained in March that Chelsea have been keen for Kovacic to stay, although talks hadn   t progressed at that stage and the player and his representatives were already weighing up other options. Now, 90min can report that Kovacic has made clear to Chelsea that he is not prepared to even talk about signing a new contract at Stamford Bridge. feed Manchester City, who could soon lose captain Ilkay Gundogan on a free transfer to Barcelona with his contract winding down, were already interested in the 29-year-old. Manchester United are also in the market for a midfielder, with Frenkie de Jong still of interest despite a full deal failing to materialise last summer, and consider Kovacic an alternative option. But sources have confirmed to 90min that it is City who have started their approach. Chelsea are not expected to make it difficult for Kovacic to leave Stamford Bridge. The Blues have not set a prohibitive price tag and are prepared for the player to choose his next club. As far as he is concerned, his preference is to stay in England.
