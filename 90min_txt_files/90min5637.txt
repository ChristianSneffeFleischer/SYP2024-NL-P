West Ham United are targeting a loan swoop for Arsenal centre back Calum Chambers, as David Moyes looks to add to his defensive options. The Hammers lost their opening two fixtures of the new Premier League season, and now face a tricky run of Wolves, Leicester City and Tottenham Hotspur in their next three matches. According to The Telegraph, the east London side have set their sights on a loan move for Chambers, who is also capable at right-back - another area Moyes wants to improve. West Ham have reportedly made unsuccessful attempts to sign Burnley centre-back James Tarkowski this summer, with Sean Dyche's side demanding  Â£50m for the sale of their star defender. While Tarkowski was a priority for the Hammers, Chambers' versatility makes him a favourable alternative target for Moyes.  Speaking in the press conference after the club's recent 2-1 defeat to Arsenal, he said: "We would probably like to add a left-back, a central defender, a right-back, or players who play centre-back and full-back positions or vice versa.    I think it   s a bit of both [loan and permanent signings]. Some players with clubs are happy to loan out but maybe not sell. Some are very extensive and are taking loans, plus bits of options after it.    There   s no real clear cut answer but we are trying to get them in whatever way we think is right.
