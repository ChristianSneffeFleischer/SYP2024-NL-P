Sergino Dest has joined reigning Serie A champions AC Milan on loan from Barcelona. The Rossoneri have negotiated an option to buy as part of the transfer, with the American moving to San Siro initially until the end of the 2022/23 season. 21-year-old Dest had been linked with a move to Manchester United to reunite with former manager at Ajax, Erik ten Hag, and was also courting interest from Villarreal in La Liga. But he has now moved to Milan, who are defending the Serie A title they won last season for the first time in a decade. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey,Toby Cudworth and Harry Symeou bring you a live deadline day edition of Talking Transfers. The team welcome Daniel Childs and Julien Laurens to the show to discuss Chelsea's late window activity, Arsenal's pursuit of Douglas Luiz, Paris Saint-Germain's summer signings & much more! The show is also available on all audio platforms. Dest is the latest player to be shown the door in what has been a remarkable summer of transfer activity at Camp Nou, though much of the fuss and furore around Barcelona's dealings has actually been their method of signing players.
