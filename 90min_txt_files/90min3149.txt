Barcelona director Jordi Cruyff has confessed the change of ownership at Chelsea has got in the way of their pursuits of defenders Marcos Alonso and Cesar Azpilicueta. Interest from Barcelona in the two Spaniards is nothing new and the previous Chelsea chiefs had been open to offloading both, with a gentleman's agreement with Azpilicueta that he would be sold if he asked for the move. All negotiations were paused while Roman Abramovich sold the Blues to the consortium led by Todd Boehly, after which fresh decisions on Azpilicueta and Alonso must be made - 90min understands the pair remain keen to leave. Cruyff was asked about Barcelona's moves for Azpilicueta and Alonso during the presentation of former Chelsea man Andreas Christensen, who has signed on a free transfer, and he admitted things have been left up in the air because of the Blues' takeover. "It is true that the change of ownership of Chelsea has delayed everything a bit," Cruyff said. "It is obvious that we want to strengthen the team and our job is to have plenty of names on the table. "What struck me the most is that, when players hear the name of Barcelona, their eyes open and they are willing to give up some money to adapt to the new salary structure. It is a source of pride to see how they are willing to lose money to fight for these colours. The new salary structure must be fair and stable. "We don't want to talk about names, because they have contracts with their clubs. But it is true that we are looking to strengthen in positions that we consider fundamental."
