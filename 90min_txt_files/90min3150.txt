For the first time in his professional career, Jesse Lingard is going to start a season not contracted to boyhood club Manchester United. The 29-year-old was released following the expiration of his contract at Old Trafford at the end of last month. There are of course Premier League clubs keeping tabs on him, but Lingard is also set to head to the US to discuss a potential move to MLS. Here are the clubs, English and American, that Lingard could join this summer, why he might choose them and why he might steer clear - brought to you by one of the States' finest creations. Pros: Successful loan spell, play in Europe, huge stadium in a huge cityCons: Might not like bubbles, would be outnumbered in EastEnders vs Coronation Street debatesCity: LondonLocal cuisine: Jellied eelsA return to West Ham would probably suit Lingard best, even if he's been putting off a move back to London Stadium for a year.He would slot right back into their system under a manager who clearly wants him. Really, this should be a no-brainer. Pros: Play in Europe (technically), one of England's biggest clubsCons: Play in Europe (only geographically), team just lost their best player, relegation candidatesCity: LiverpoolLocal cuisine: ScouseEverton avoided relegation from the Premier League by the skin of their teeth last season and they've just sold their best player in Richarlison.Sure, getting Lingard on a free might be the most Everton thing imaginable, but they should probably use their scarce resources in other areas. Pros: Could be teammates with superstars like Gareth Bale and Giorgio Chiellini, would almost certainly win silverwareCons: Not even playing in Europe (competitively or geographically)City: Los AngelesLocal cuisine: Apparently it's French dipped toast, but that sounds too FrenchIf Lingard is looking to secure a payday and boost his brand in one of the world's largest and significant countries, then there's every chance he could head to LAFC.While it's being reported they won't get into a bidding war for Lingard, LAFC do have another DP space on their roster to accommodate him, while they are said to be eyeing another player to star with Bale and Carlos Vela up front. Pros: It's like playing for Real Madrid but in AmericaCons: Not actually like playing for Real Madrid at allCity: Los AngelesLocal cuisine: Hang on, let me Google another...ice cream sandwichAcross Los Angeles, the Galaxy have a long history of signing big-name players, while they are currently trying to shift the current one in Douglas Costa.They would need to find a suitor for said Brazilian first as they currently do not have any DP slots open.
