Arsenal are continuing talks with Ajax for Jurrien Timber and are confident that they will reach an agreement in the near future, sources have told 90min. The Gunners are looking to add another defender to their ranks in the summer transfer window, and they quickly identified Timber as a priority target. 90min reported earlier this week that Arsenal had made an opening offer to Ajax for the Netherlands international. However, their    35m bid fell well below the Dutch club's asking price of    60m. Sources have confirmed to 90min that Arsenal are hopeful of bringing Ajax's demands down to a figure below    50m and there is confidence that a deal will soon be struck. Timber, who was courted by Manchester United and former manager Erik ten Hag last summer, is keen on a move to the Emirates Stadium. feed 90min understands that Arsenal view Timber, a centre-back capable of playing at right-back and in midfield, as a player who can operate in a similar fashion to the versatile Oleksandr Zinchenko. The plan would be to use Timber on the right side of defence and have him mirror Zinchenko or simply give them the option to tilt their backline the way the Ukrainian allows them to. Meanwhile, Arsenal are expected to make Kai Havertz their first summer signing after agreeing a fee with Chelsea, while they will also make another bid for Declan Rice though face competition from Manchester City. The Gunners are also in talks with Southampton over Belgium midfielder Romeo Lavia.
