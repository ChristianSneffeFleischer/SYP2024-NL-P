Fenerbahce are working to try and secure the loan signing of Tottenham winger Ryan Sessegnon on the final day of the Turkish transfer window.  The 21-year-old is thought to have been offered to the Super Lig giants so that he may play more regular first-team to aid his long-term development, having already spent time on loan at Hoffenheim since his arrival from Fulham in 2019.  CNN in Turkey report that the Fenerbahce coach Vitor Pereira has indicated to club officials his desire to get a deal over the line in time. 90min understands that Spurs had turned down approaches for Sessegnon before the English transfer deadline, but the player is yet to make a Premier League appearance this season. The versatile left-sided player rose to prominence as a teenager at Fulham, earning lofty praise from the age of 16. He featured in all 49 of the Cottagers' Championship and play-off matches in 2017/18, scoring 16, assisting eight and helping the club to promotion to the Premier League.   But Sessegnon has struggled to break into Spurs' first team since his arrival. He has so far made just 14 appearances for the club, and was sent on loan to Hoffenheim for the 2020/21 season.
