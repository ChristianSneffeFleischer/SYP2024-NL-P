Enzo Fernandez will not be leaving Benfica unless an interested party meets his    120m release clause, 90min understands. The 21-year-old has enhanced his growing reputation with a series of impressive performances at the World Cup and will have the opportunity to lift the trophy on Sunday in Argentina's sixth final appearance. Fernandez only joined Benfica in the summer, amid interest from Manchester City, Manchester United and Wolves - who he came close to joining - but reports elsewhere have recently suggested that a move to Liverpool has already been agreed. However, sources have told 90min that the Portuguese giants are unaware of any agreement, and that talk of a 'done deal' is premature. Harry Symeou hosts Andy Headspeath, Quentin Gesp and Jack Gallagher to look back on the 2018 World Cup finals in Russia - join us!

Real Madrid and Barcelona are also admirers of Fernandez's talents, though Benfica have no desire to sell in January and the player himself is fully focussed on winning the World Cup with Argentina.
