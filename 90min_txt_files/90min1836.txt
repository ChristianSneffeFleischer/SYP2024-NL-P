Leicester City are continuing talks to sign Victor Kristiansen and Nicolas Gonzalez before the end of the January transfer window, sources have told 90min.  The Foxes are in real danger of being dragged into a relegation dogfight this season following a series of subpar displays. Brendan Rodgers has been busy trying to add to his squad this month, leading Leicester to left-back Kristiansen and versatile forward Gonzalez. 90min understands that Leicester's talks with Kobenhavn for Kristiansen are advanced and a    20m deal could be wrapped up this weekend. The 20-year-old has already played 73 times for Kobenhavn's first team and is a regular in Denmark's Under-21 setup. On this edition of Talking Transfers, Scott Saunders hosts Toby Cudworth & Graeme Bailey to discuss all the big transfer stories. This week's agenda includes Jude Bellingham, Harry Kane, Declan Rice, Hakim Ziyech, Leandro Trossard, Pedro Porro, Mykhaylo Mudryk and more!
