Manchester City have confirmed the signing of Spanish left-back Sergio Gomez from Anderlecht. The 21-year-old spent time in the Barcelona academy earlier in his career, where he was actually trained as an attacker, but after a tricky spell with Borussia Dortmund, he moved to Anderlecht in the summer of 2021 and reinvented himself as a left-back. His debut season in Belgium, where he worked under City legend Vincent Kompany, yielded seven goals and 15 assists in 49 outings. That form has convinced City to bring him to Manchester.    I am incredibly proud and happy to have joined Manchester City,    Gomez said.    City are the best team in England and in  Pep Guardiola  I have a chance to learn and develop under the most outstanding manager in world football.    To be able to be part of this club is a dream come true for me and something any young player would aspire to.
