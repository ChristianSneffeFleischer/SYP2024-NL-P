Xavi says he is unsure if Lionel Messi will return to Barcelona this summer as a move would be dependent on the Argentine's "intentions". Messi's contract with Paris Saint-Germain will expire at the end of the season and he will not extend his deal with the French giants. 90min revealed earlier in May Bar  a are 'hugely confident' of bringing the World Cup winner back to Camp Nou, even in the face of interest from Al Hilal. Messi recently made a trip to Saudi Arabia which saw him disciplined by PSG. MLS outfit Inter Miami also have a known desire to sign the Argentine. Xavi, who played with Messi during his time at Barcelona, has admitted the decision lies firmly with his old teammate. "It's up in the air," Xavi told reporters. "It depends on many things. There is not much more I can say. Leo is a spectacular footballer. He is a friend. From there, it depends on many things, but above all on his intentions and what he wants." Robert Lewandowski has also publicly urged the World Cup winner to return to the club he scored 672 goals for. manual "I want to play with Messi here in Barcelona. He has changed his style in recent years. It is easier to play with players who understand football as deeply as he does," said the Polish striker. "Messi's playing style has evolved in recent years. He thinks differently, and positions himself differently on the pitch. He has a unique sense. We would definitely use it." Barcelona are currently awaiting La Liga's approval of a viability plan, which would enable them to register players who have recently signed new contracts and pursue further signings.
