Barcelona are keen to find a long-term successor for left-back Jordi Alba this summer and have their sights set on AZ Alkmaar starlet Owen Wijndal. Alba played some of the best football of his career this season, but at 32 years old, there is an awareness at Camp Nou that his time at the highest level could be coming to an end in the near future. Junior Firpo has not done enough to convince Barcelona he is capable of filling Alba's shoes, so AS claim the club are now on the hunt for a replacement and Wijndal's name is towards the top of the wish list. The 21-year-old Dutch international recently made his 100th appearance in all competitions for AZ, playing every single minute in each of their 43 games across the Eredivisie, Europa League and the KNVB Cup. Wijndal has long been seen as a potential star of both the present and the future, with Barcelona boss Ronald Koeman understood to be a huge fan, and talks are now being planned over a deal to bring the young left-back to Camp Nou. President Joan Laporta is hopeful negotiations could be relatively easy as Wijndal is represented by Mino Raiola, with whom Laporta has a close relationship. No transfer fee is mentioned, but Barcelona are understood to be keen to avoid having to pay more than  Â£13m, which would be an enormous bargain for a player of Wijndal's calibre. Another option under consideration is promoting 17-year-old academy starlet Alejandro Balde, but while the club still have faith in the youngster, there is a belief that Balde is not yet ready for consistent minutes at such a high level. Instead, the focus has been turned to Wijndal, who has clearly proven that he can be relied upon in the senior game.
