Liverpool are among the clubs interested in Leeds midfielder Tyler Adams, 90min understands. However, it is Bournemouth who have taken the biggest steps towards a deal so far. Jurgen Klopp   s side have signed both Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboslai to strengthen in midfield since the end of last season. But with Jordan Henderson, Fabinho, James Milner, Naby Keita and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain all leaving, getting additional bodies in has still been important. Liverpool had been in hot pursuit of Romeo Lavia and then Moises Caicedo. Three bids were made for the former, who is now on course to join Chelsea from Southampton in a deal worth up to  £55m. The latter has already signed for Chelsea after the Londoners gazumped Liverpool   s accepted  £111m offer, which would have broken the British transfer record, with a  £115m bid of their own. The Reds still have plenty of potential options to recruit a midfielder and time left to do it before the transfer window closes. One they are keeping tabs on is Adams, who also nearly became a Chelsea player prior to the Lavia and Caicedo sagas reaching a conclusion. feed As 90min reported at the time, Chelsea triggered the  £20m release clause in Adams    contract with Leeds. The United States international then travelled to London for talks but ended up returning to west Yorkshire when negotiations collapsed at the same time as Lavia and Caicedo talks accelerated.
