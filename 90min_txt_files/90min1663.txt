You have to begrudgingly respect Todd Boehly, I suppose. The bloke's got some serious cojones (and a lot of money) on him.  Chelsea's owner has laughed in the face of Financial Fair Play and, like a rich kid in Hamleys, brought a bunch of shiny new toys for Blues supporters to enjoy. A busy summer in 2022 has been followed up by a gargantuan January, and there's no denying that he's trying his utmost to put Graham Potter in the best position to succeed at Stamford Bridge. Here's a list of Chelsea's confirmed ins and outs in the 2023 January transfer window. Well, where do we start? Monaco defender Benoit Badiashile was the first major signing through the door before the club beat out several Premier League rivals for the lucrative loan signing of Joao Felix. The club then moved with conviction to bring in Mykhaylo Mudryk from under Arsenal's nose in a deal that could be worth up to  £100m when it's all said and done. The Ukrainian winger joined Chelsea on a mammoth eight-and-a-half year contract.  Another winger was signed in the form of ex-Tottenham academy starlet Noni Madueke before they wrapped up a deal for talented young Lyon full-back Malo Gusto. Then, just to top it all off, the Blues finally struck a mammoth  £107m deal for the services of World Cup-winning midfielder Enzo Fernandez on deadline day. The Argentine is poised to transform Potter's midfield with his unique skill set. Andrey Santos and David Dietro Fofana are two lower key signings that may have a greater say in west London further down the line. It was quiet on the departures front, but Chelsea were able to sell Jorginho, whose contract was expiring in the summer, to Arsenal for  £10m.
