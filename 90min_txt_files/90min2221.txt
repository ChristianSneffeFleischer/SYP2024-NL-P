Ajax's Mohammed Kudus is emerging as one of the stars of the 2022 World Cup and his performances have caught the attention of a host of Premier League clubs, 90min understands. Everton came close to landing 22-year-old Kudus in the summer with a  Â£15m offer, but Ajax ultimately decided against letting the youngster depart. Kudus failed to nail down a staring spot in Alfred Schreuder's starting XI until mid-October, but went into the World Cup as more of a regular at club level. Liverpool were already aware of Kudus' talent before the tournament - not least due to their meetings in the Champions League this season - but having started so few games for Ajax thus far, his performances in Qatar have given them the chance to assess him further and they have been impressed. Kudus has also played a more attacking role from midfield with Ghana and that has emphasised their belief he could be ready to make the move to England. Arsenal, Tottenham and Newcastle have all asked about the player   s current situation off the back of his standout performances for the Black Stars, while Everton retain their interest. Harry Symeou hosts Scott Saunders and Toby Cudworth to look back on South Korea/Japan '02 as part of the 'Our World Cup' series. We take a trip down memory lane - join us!
