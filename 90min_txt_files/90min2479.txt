Sporting CP's Marcus Edwards says he definitely intends to return to England to play in the Premier League in the future. After a loan spell in the Netherlands, Edwards left his home country for good in 2019, leaving Tottenham to play for Portuguese side Vit  ria de Guimar Â£es. He impressed there, earning a move to Sporting CP in January of this year, and that move saw him go up against former club Spurs on the second matchday of this season Champions League. In a game his current team won 2-0, he was one of the stand-out players, creating a number of chances and almost scoring a stunning goal himself. Asked after the match if he'd like to return to the Premier League should the chance arise in the future, he had no doubts. "Yeah of course, it   s my home. Of course I want to come back there one day," he told BT Sport. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  and  Toby Cudworth  bring you a brand new episode of Talking Transfers.

That being said, he says he's very much happy in Lisbon and is in no rush to bid farewell to his current club.  "It   s a proper family environment, I couldn   t be happier here," he added. "It feels great, winning it at the end like that after we put in a hard shift. Couldn   t be happier. I think we deserved that."
