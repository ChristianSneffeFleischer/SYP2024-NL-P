Arsenal have confirmed young right-back Brooke Norton-Cuffy has joined Rotherham on loan for the 2022/23 campaign. Hopes are high for 18-year-old Norton-Cuffy, who impressed with Lincoln in League One last season before playing a starring role in England Under-19's triumph at this summer's European Championships. A long-term contract was a reward for his outstanding 12 months, and now Arsenal have confirmed the next step in Norton-Cuffy's development will be a loan move to Rotherham in the Championship. Norton-Cuffy will join up with former Gunners left-back duo Cohen Bramall and Tolaji Bola. Another former team-mate, Jordi Osei-Tutu, spent last season on loan with Rotherham before leaving permanently for Bochum earlier this summer. Rotherham were promoted from League One last season and currently sit 13th in the second tier after four games. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  &  Toby Cudworth  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Erik ten Hag wanting to sign five players before the transfer window closes, and Man Utd's attitude to selling Cristiano Ronaldo.
