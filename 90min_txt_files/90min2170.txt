D.C. United have signed Iraq National Team defender Mohanad Jeahze from Swedish first division team Hammarby IF.   He joins on a three-year deal through the 2025 Major League Soccer season with an option in 2026, pending receipt of his P-1 Visa and International Transfer Certificate (ITC).   The deal was completed using Targeted Allocation Money (TAM), and stands as a Special Discovery signing for D.C. United.    Mohanad has proven himself to be one of the best left backs in the Nordics over the last two years and we are delighted to have a player of his quality join D.C. United,    Dave Kasper, D.C. United President of Soccer Operations, said.      Our style of play requires our outside backs to have high energy levels, technical ability, and excellent service in the final third and Mohanad ticks all of these boxes. He will be an excellent complement to our core group as we look to continue building out our roster for 2023.    He arrived after spending the previous three seasons with Swedish powerhouse Hammarby IF, where he managed five goals and 19 assists in 89 overall appearances. He also spent one season with Mj  llby AIF, recording three goals and five assists in 43 games across all competitions.   Jeahze stands as a product of the IFK Norrk  ping Academy in Sweden and signed his first professional contract with the club on June 20, 2016 at 19-years-old, before seeing stints elsewhere.
