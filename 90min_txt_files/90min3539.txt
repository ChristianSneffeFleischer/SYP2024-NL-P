Palmeiras sensation Endrick has admitted he is flattered by interest from both Real Madrid and Barcelona, but confessed that he's rooting for Los Blancos to come out on top on the pitch this season. The 15-year-old has attracted attention from Europe's elite after dazzling in Brazil, but Real and Barcelona are expected to battle for his signature this summer before letting him develop in his homeland until he turns 18. Endrick sat down with Marca to discuss the speculation, and the teenager could hardly hide his excitement towards being followed by Real. "It is a club that I have great affection for," he explained. "Cristiano Ronaldo, who I have always followed, won four Champions Leagues there. "I have great affection for Real thanks to Cristiano, although I have also looked at their history and they are a very good team. It is very gratifying for me to know that they are watching me and following my games. I thank God very much, but I have to do more. I still have a long way to go." Then asked about Barcelona, Endrick was just as thankful for the praise. "They are a very good team as well," he said. "Spectacular, with incredible players, some of whom have already played there like [Lionel] Messi, Xavi and [Andres] Iniesta. "It's good that one of the best in the world follow me as a player and a person. I thank God very much." The conversation soon turned back to Real and the signed shirt sent to Endrick by Vinicius Junior, who was in a similar situation back in 2018 when he struck a  Â£39m deal to move to the Santiago Bernabeu.
