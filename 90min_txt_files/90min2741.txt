Everton midfielder Dele Alli is in talks over a potential move to Super Lig side Besiktas this summer, 90min understands.  Dele Alli burst onto the scene in 2015 at Tottenham Hotspur scoring 28 goals in his first two full seasons in the Premier League and winning two consecutive PFA Young Player of the Year awards.  A mixture of niggling injuries and a lack of form in the years since have saw him fall out of favour at Tottenham and the England international set up - with the midfielder not earning a senior cap since 2019.  The 26-year-old left Spurs during the January transfer window and joined Everton, but hasn't really got his career back on track at Goodison Park. Dele Alli is yet to score for the Toffees and has yet to start a game this season.  Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  &  Toby Cudworth  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Erik ten Hag wanting to sign five players before the transfer window closes, and Man Utd's attitude to selling Cristiano Ronaldo. Available on  all audio platforms  and the  90min YouTube channel. If you can't see the podcast embed, click  here  to download the episode in full! Now Dele could be on the move once again as 90min understands that he is in talks over a move to Besiktas before the end of the summer transfer window.
