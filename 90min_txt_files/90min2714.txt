Jurrien Timber has signed a new contract with Dutch giants Ajax, extending his stay in Amsterdam until 2025. The Netherlands international made his senior debut for the club in 2019 and has played 77 games in all competitions, scoring four times. He had attracted interest from Manchester United, now managed by Erik ten Hag, earlier in the summer. United have since poached Lisandro Martinez from Ajax for    55m after deciding on the Argentine as their primary defensive target, establishing Timber even further as one of the Eredivisie side's more experienced defenders, even at 21 years of age. Timber has started Ajax's first two league games this season, helping them pick up six points as the champions look to retain their title. Alongside Martinez, United have brought in Tyrell Malacia and Christian Eriksen during the summer, though their strategy in the transfer market has attracted criticism from some corners. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  &  Toby Cudworth  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Erik ten Hag wanting to sign five players before the transfer window closes, and Man Utd's attitude to selling Cristiano Ronaldo.
