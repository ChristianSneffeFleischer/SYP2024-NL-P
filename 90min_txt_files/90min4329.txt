Arsenal are showing interest in versatile RB Leipzig and USMNT player Tyler Adams as the Gunners look to secure the right-back position, amid the possibility that Hector Bellerin could move on. Bellerin has been linked with a number of clubs, including Paris Saint-Germain, Atletico Madrid and Real Betis. Juventus have also been added to that list in recent days. Adams is part of an emerging generation of American talent and has played as a defensive midfielder, right-back and wing-back for Leipzig over the past year alone. The Athletic writes that such versatility makes him a good fit for Mikel Arteta   s tactical system at Arsenal and the club are    keen    on the 22-year-old. However, it is also noted that Leipzig, having already lost Dayot Upamecano to Bayern Munich and Ibrahima Konate to Liverpool this summer, may not be willing to let another starter leave. Arsenal   s search for a right-back has already led them to serious interest in Norwich star Max Aarons, who impressed for the Canaries in the Premier League during the 2019/20 campaign and again in the Championship this season to help them get promoted. Despite their return to the top flight, Norwich would be willing to let Aarons go if a suitable offer meets their asking price, a policy that has already been seen in action when they sold Emi Buendia to Aston Villa for an initial  £33m just this week. 90min revealed in late April that Norwich have informed Aarons they won   t stand in his way if their valuation of around  £30m is met. The player was born in London, before moving to Luton and Norwich, but would be happy to now return to the capital.
