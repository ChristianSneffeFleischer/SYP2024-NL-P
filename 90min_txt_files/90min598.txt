Ruben Loftus-Cheek has completed his permanent move from Chelsea to AC Milan. The academy graduate, who joined Chelsea at the age of eight, spent 19 years on the books at Stamford Bridge and managed a total of 155 appearances for the Blues in all competitions. A serious Achilles injury towards the end of the 2018/19 campaign derailed his long-awaited breakout season and, after a loan to Fulham in 2020/21, Loftus-Cheek would be restricted to a squad role for the remainder of his Chelsea career. In search of a fresh start, Loftus-Cheek has opted to take his talents to Milan, where he will join up with former Blues teammate Fikayo Tomori on a four-year contract. feed Chelsea have been active in the selling market this summer, parting ways with Kai Havertz, Mateo Kovacic, Edouard Mendy and Kalidou Koulibaly thus far, and they are expected to be followed out the Cesar Azpilicueta, who has agreed terms with Inter. Hakim Ziyech remains of interest to Saudi side Al Nassr but concerns highlighted during a medical have left his move hanging in the balance. Business between Chelsea and Milan may not stop here as the Serie A side are interested in a handful of Blues players, including winger Christian Pulisic. Like Loftus-Cheek, Pulisic has two years remaining on his Chelsea contract and is free to leave the club this summer for the right price. The American has attracted interest across Serie A. Chelsea are known admirers of Milan goalkeeper Mike Maignan but the 27-year-old is likely to be too expensive for the Premier League side, who are looking for competition for Kepa Arrizabalaga in goal.
