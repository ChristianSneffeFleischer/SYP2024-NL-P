Chelsea are poised to reignite their interest in Jesus Corona, but will need to complete a deal before June to avoid an additional  £12.6m being added to the Porto man's release clause. Corona has impressed this season, chipping in with three goals and 11 assists in 40 appearances, and he and Porto are set for a Champions League quarter final showdown with Chelsea in April. The Blues were linked with a move for the 28-year-old last summer, and despite former boss Frank Lampard having since been replaced by Thomas Tuchel, the club's interest still remains. According to Portuguese news outlet O Jogo (via the Daily Mail), Chelsea are again targeting Corona. The Mexican international has a  £21.4m release clause in his contract, but this is only active until June 2021. From June onwards, Chelsea or any other interested party would be required to cough up  £34m to secure his services. Chelsea's links to the versatile wide man dates back to 2020, with his agent Matias Bunge revealing in May that the Blues had made contact regarding a potential move. "At some point we talked to them [Chelsea]. I cannot say if he's option A, B or C, now they are rather rumours," Bunge said. "We'll have to wait a bit for this to continue moving forward and for the leagues to begin again, and from there see what the next movements will be because the market is a little bit stopped.
