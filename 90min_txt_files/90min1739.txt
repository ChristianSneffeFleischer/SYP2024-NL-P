Leicester City have reached out to Stoke about a possible January move for centre-back Harry Souttar, 90min understands. The 24-year-old only returned from a nasty knee injury weeks before the World Cup but earned plenty of praise for his performances with Australia, who fell to eventual winners Argentina in the round of 16. Now a regular starter at club level once again, Souttar has attracted plenty of interest from clubs higher up the football pyramid and sources have confirmed to 90min that Leicester have reached out about a potential January move. Stoke are understood to value Souttar at around the  Â£15m mark, although the Foxes are not believed to share that estimation. No bid has been made at this point, with Leicester considering all options before moving forwards. Alex Neil's Stoke find themselves 18th in the Championship, seven points clear of the relegation zone but having played two more games than Huddersfield in 22nd, and so they are reluctant to part ways with their most valuable defender. Stoke have also allowed Aden Flint to return to Sheffield Wednesday on loan, leaving their options at centre-back limited even before a potential departure for Souttar. As for Leicester, they are working to bolster their squad ahead of the closure of the transfer window and 90min understands the Foxes remain confident about their chances of signing Brazilian winger Tete, who is set to terminate his loan with Lyon this month.
