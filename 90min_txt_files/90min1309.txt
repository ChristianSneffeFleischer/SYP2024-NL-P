Jack Harrison is set to sign a new long-term contract at Leeds United, sources have confirmed to 90min. The 26-year-old has returned to form under new manager Javi Gracia having almost joined relegation rivals Leicester City in the January transfer window. He had fallen out of favour under previous boss Jesse Marsch but was denied a move to the Foxes at the eleventh hour. Now back to his best, talks over a new deal have progressed quickly and Harrison has agreed terms with Leeds to extend his stay at the club. Harrison's previous deal, which he signed having joined from Manchester City in 2021, was due to expire next summer. In a recent interview with the Daily Telegraph, Harrison admitted just how much he is loving life under Gracia. "When he   s talking to the players he   s often got his laser pointed at a player saying    you should be two centimetres to the left   . He   s very particular, but we have to be so focused on the small details," Harrison said. "He   s demanding as a coach but is all about us being together, which is important from now until the end of the season. "I know the fans want us to be entertaining and quick, but it   s not always possible. At this point we need to get results, and Javi is the perfect manager for that."

"I try to take care of all my players the same way. Jack is keeping a high level, always with the desire to improve," Gracia commented. "I try to speak with all my players because it's my job. I have to try to help them to improve their level. Maybe you speak about different actions in the games but all of them deserve my consideration." LISTEN NOW
