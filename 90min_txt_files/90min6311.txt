Leeds United have a clause in Jean-K  vin Augustin's loan deal which will see him join the club on a permanent basis should they get promoted to the Premier League. The forward spent the second half of the season on loan from RB Leipzig, but his move proved unsuccessful, playing just 48 minutes in three Championship appearances. Leeds had hoped when they brought Augustin in that he would add some goals to the side, following Eddie Nketiah's return to Arsenal. However, the Frenchman did not have his loan stay extended, despite clubs being allowed to in light of the Covid-19 pandemic. Bild claim there is a    21m clause in his loan deal that Leeds will be forced to pay if they secure promotion to the Premier League. The report adds that United "will have to buy" Augustin, with RB Leipzig already including the money in their summer transfer budget. The German side have already lost Timo Werner to Chelsea and have expressed a desire to replace him by making Patrik Schick's loan from Roma permanent. At the back, they could lose highly-rated 21-year-old Dayot Upamecano, whose contract expires next summer.
