Leicester City striker Islam Slimani is reportedly set to turn down a return to former club Sporting CP. The Lisbon side are believed to be in the hunt for a new striker, especially since they are yet to replace the goals of Bruno Fernandes following his transfer to Manchester United in January.  Algerian striker Islam Slimani had been linked with a move back to Portugal, but it appears as if the player sees France as his preferred destination, according to a report from Portuguese outlet A Bola.  The article claims that Sporting made an approach for the 32-year-old, but an unnamed French side are willing to offer more money. A Bola claims that a deal with the Portuguese club will only be possible if Slimani is willing to accept a lower salary.  Sport Witness expands on A Bola's report by claiming that the French side in question are Stade Rennais. However, last month's signing of Amiens forward Serhou Guirassy has cast some doubt on the situation.  Slimani played for Sporting for three seasons after joining from CR Belouizdad in 2013. He was a massive hit at Estadio Jose Alvalade, scoring 57 times in 109 appearances in all competitions and winning two trophies. This form earned him a move to Leicester City in 2016 for a then-club record fee.
