Manchester City right-back Kyle Walker is in discussions with Bayern Munich over a move to the Allianz Arena, sources have told 90min. The 33-year-old has only 12 months left to run on his contract at the Etihad Stadium and has been assessing his options in recent months. He is not short of suitors - 90min first reported back in April that boyhood club Sheffield United were interested in a reunion with Walker, while West Ham United and clubs in Saudi Arabia have also emerged as potential destinations since. And 90min understands that Bayern are now in talks with Walker, with both parties sharing a mutual interest in finalising a deal. Bayern are set to part ways with right-back Benjamin Pavard this summer and so are on the lookout for a replacement to come in and compete with Noussair Mazraoui for the starting spot. feed Interestingly, Man City and Bayern have remained in close contact regarding the futures of Joao Cancelo and Joshua Kimmich. 90min understands the German champions want to keep Cancelo following his six-month loan spell in Bavaria, but for a fee lower than his    70m purchase clause. Man City are among several top European sides interested in Kimmich, who is considering his future at Bayern. Reports in Germany have claimed that head coach Thomas Tuchel has regularly been at the club's offices since the Bundesliga season ended and has not yet been on holiday as he is working on plans for the 2023/24 campaign. Bayern wrestled the Bundesliga title away from rivals Borussia Dortmund on the final day of the 2022/23 season in dramatic fashion, with BVB losing at home to Mainz and Die Roten beating Koln late on to jump back into top spot. Despite Tuchel's European pedigree, Bayern were emphatically dumped out of the UEFA Champions League at the quarter-final stage by eventual winners Man City.
