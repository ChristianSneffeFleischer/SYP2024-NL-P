Bayern Munich have drawn a line under their failed pursuit of Callum Hudson-Odoi, with sporting director Hasan Salihamid  i   admitting his side will look elsewhere in the future. The German club have been chasing a deal for the forward for over a year, stretching back to the previous summer before Hudson-Odoi penned a new five-year-deal. A post shared by Callum Hudson-Odoi (@calteck10) on Oct 5, 2020 at 11:45am PDT With his contract winding down, Bayern continued to press in their efforts to lure him to Bavaria, but despite Hudson-Odoi handing in a transfer request that window, he was eventually persuaded to remain in west London. However, expecting to see regular first team minutes last season, his contribution to Chelsea was minimal under Frank Lampard after he returned from a long-term injury. The Blues then invested heavily in fellow forwards Hakim Ziyech, Timo Werner and Kai Havertz, leaving his involvement ever bleaker. Due to that, Bayern pushed for a loan move in September - one that included a  Â£70m buy option - but once again their efforts failed. As such, Salihamid  i   has insisted they will call time on their efforts.    There are transfers that get to the point where you have to say we   re out now," he told SportBild. "This makes it all the more important to think about alternatives or alternative ways from the outset.    We negotiated with Chelsea but there was no agreement. That   s what happened    After being used fleetingly last season, the 19-year-old has found playing time more regularly this term. Coming off the bench at half time in the 3-3 draw with West Brom he got himself his first league goal of the campaign, earning him a starting berth for the 4-0 thumping of Crystal Palace on matchday four.
