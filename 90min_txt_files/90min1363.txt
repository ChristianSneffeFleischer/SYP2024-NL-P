Bayern Munich and Barcelona have joined the lengthy list of clubs scouting Republic of Ireland forward Evan Ferguson, 90min understands.  Ferguson has burst onto the scene this season at Brighton and Hove Albion under Roberto Di Zerbi, becoming a key player for the Italian manager. Despite being just 18 years old, Ferguson has managed to score seven goals and bag three assists in 16 games for the high-fyling Premier League club.  The 18-year-old also recently made his debut for Republic of Ireland's senior team, scoring in the Boys in Green's 3-2 win over Latvia at the Aviva Stadium. This form has, as expected, caught the eye of a number of Europe's top clubs. 90min understands that Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich are the latest of these clubs to scout Ferguson, watching the forward's impressive Ireland debut at the Aviva on Wednesday.   Along with Bayern, SSC Napoli and Barcelona have also watched Ferguson, with sources close to Barca telling 90min that the club see him as a 'player of huge potential'.

Chelsea, Newcastle United and Liverpool have all scouted the Irish striker - the latter of which have been aware of Ferguson since his breakthrough at Bohemians when he was just 16 years old - while Manchester United have kept an eye on Ferguson and his compatriot Andy Moran's progress throughout this season. Moran - another Irish youngster - has been restricted to under-23 football for most of the season but could be set for a breakthrough into the Brighton first-team in the near future.  Despite the huge amount of interest, 90min understands that Ferguson isn't in a hurry to leave Brighton. The forward is very happy at the club and is in line for a new, much improved, contract at the Amex Stadium.
