Juventus forward Cristiano Ronaldo has offered himself back to Real Madrid as he looks to seal a transfer away from Turin this summer. Ronaldo is frustrated at Juventus and keen to secure an exit, but the Bianconeri do not share that stance and want to tie him down to a new contract in the near future to put an end to all the speculation. According to AS, their efforts will be in vain as Ronaldo still has his heart set on a transfer, and he is so desperate to do so that he is prepared to offer himself back to former employers Real. Ronaldo's love for Real is obvious, but what makes him more interested in a return is the appointment of Carlo Ancelotti as manager. Ronaldo is a huge fan of the Italian and hopes to work with him once again. Unfortunately, it's not going to happen, and deep down, Ronaldo knows it. Real have made it clear that they are not interested in anyone apart from Paris Saint-Germain's Kylian Mbappe. If PSG stand firm and refuse to sell the Frenchman, Real are not going to turn to Plan B, even though they would be able to afford Ronaldo. It's for that reason that Ronaldo is praying that Real do end up signing Mbappe. He wants PSG to lose a superstar this summer as he believes the French side would make an offer which both he and Juventus would not be able to refuse. Ronaldo is now watching the Mbappe saga with keen eyes, but all the signs suggest he's not going to get what he wants. Le Parisien have stressed that Mbappe will not be sold this summer, which would mean that neither PSG nor Real would approach Ronaldo.
