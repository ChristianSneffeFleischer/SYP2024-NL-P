Tottenham Hotspur are continuing talks with Roma regarding a move for Nicolo Zaniolo before the end of the January transfer window, 90min understands. The versatile Italian has been a long-term target of Spurs' having pushed to sign him in the summer of 2022. Though a move never materialised back then, sources have told 90min negotiations have been a bit smoother this time around. Spurs and Roma are now in broad agreement that any deal for Zaniolo should cost around    30m. The problem remains the structure of the deal. Roma are open to letting Zaniolo leave on an initial loan, but only if there was an obligatory purchase clause at the end of it. Tottenham are happy to add such a clause, but one that would only become active if they qualify for next season's Champions League. If they don't, then they want the clause to be optional instead of obligatory. Spurs currently sit six points outside the Premier League's top four.

A factor which is helping Tottenham in their pursuit of Zaniolo this time around is the willingness of Roma head coach Jose Mourinho to sanction an exit. 90min reported in the summer that the ex-Spurs boss wanted to keep the 23-year-old at the Stadio Olimpico and so blocked a transfer from going through. Mourinho confirmed after Roma's 2-0 win against Spezia on Sunday that Zaniolo has asked to leave the club, though they have not yet received an acceptable offer for him.
