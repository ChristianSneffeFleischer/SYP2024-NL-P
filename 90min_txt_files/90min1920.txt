Tottenham are keeping tabs on Leandro Trossard's situation at Brighton ahead of a potential move for the winger, 90min understands. 90min recently reported that the Seagulls have triggered a 12-month extension clause in Trossard's contract, tying him down until 2024 and ensuring he cannot leave for free this summer. Brighton's success over the last two seasons has brought transfer interest in key players such as Alexis Mac Allister - whose stock is even higher after winning the World Cup with Argentina - and Moises Caicedo. But sources have told 90min that Trossard is the regular starter most likely to leave the Amex Stadium this month, though that does not necessarily mean that Brighton will roll over and let him walk for a cut-price deal.
