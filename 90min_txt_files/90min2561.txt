Everton have agreed a  £15m fee with Manchester United for highly-rated midfielder James Garner, 90min understands. The 21-year-old has spent much of the last two seasons out on loan in the Championship, helping Watford and Nottingham Forest win promotion to the Premier League. After an impressive 2021/22 campaign at Forest, it looked as if Garner would be given a chance to prove himself at United, but 90min understands he is closing in on a move to Everton instead. The Toffees have agreed a  £15m fee including add-ons for the England youth international, though personal terms still need to be ironed out. There has been rival interest from Southampton and Leicester City but he is expected to head to Goodison Park. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  &  Toby Cudworth  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Lucas Paqueta's move to West Ham, Chelsea's plans to sign Anthony Gordon, Wesley Fofana and Arsen Zakharyan and the latest from Old Trafford.
