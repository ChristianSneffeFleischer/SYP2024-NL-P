Manchester United have been 'given the green light' to make an approach for Rennes starlet Eduardo Camavinga this summer, though they face stiff competition in the form of Real Madrid. A whole host of clubs have been credited with an interest in the 18-year-old since his breakthrough campaign last season.  His displays have already earned him international recognition having been handed his senior debut for the French national team last year, becoming the country's youngest debutant since Rene Gerard 88 years ago in the process. The Mirror report that Rennes are keen to cash in on their prized asset this summer - with just a year remaining on his current deal - offering United the chance to snap up one of Europe's most exciting talents. However, La Liga giants Real Madrid remain frontrunners to secure his services, with Camavinga reportedly eager to team up with countryman Zinedine Zidane. While the news will undoubtedly come as a blow to Old Gunnar Solskjaer's chances of landing the youngster, Zidane's future at the Santiago Bernabeu beyond the end of the season looks far from certain, meaning the Red Devils could yet emerge as frontrunners in the race to sign him. Reports suggest Zidane could face the sack at Real if he fails to secure silverware between now and the end of the season, a prospect which is far from out of the question with Los Blancos trailing La Liga leaders Atletico Madrid by six points and a tough Champions League quarter-final against 2019 winners Liverpool to come. Camavinga's agent, Jonathan Barnett, recently described the youngster as "the best young player in the world", and despite conceding it will be tough to get big deals over the line this summer, Barnett expects to see some movement.
