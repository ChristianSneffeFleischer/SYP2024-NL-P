Manchester United are deciding whether to pursue a move for Juventus midfielder Adrien Rabiot, 90min understands. The 27-year-old has been told he can leave the club the Serie A giants this summer and his services have been offered around Europe. Monaco have been leading the race to sign Rabiot and have held talks, but his sizeable wages are proving problematic - bringing United into contention to sign him. Intermediaries spoke to United about a deal earlier in the month and talks have now advanced after the Red Devils, who slipped to a 2-1 defeat to Brighton on the opening day of the Premier League season, expressed an interest in taking Rabiot to Old Trafford. The Frenchman has just a year left on his deal in Turin and is not part of Massimiliano Allegri's long-term plans, although a departure from the Allianz Stadium isn't certain - Paul Pogba is already sidelined through injury, leaving Juventus a little short of midfield options.
