Real Madrid have completed the signing of left-back Fran Garcia from Rayo Vallecano on a four-year deal. Manager Carlo Ancelotti confirmed towards the end of this season that the club had activated their option to re-sign Garcia, who came through the Real academy before joining Vallecano on loan in 2020. That move became permanent 12 months later. After two impressive years away from the Santiago Bernabeu, Garcia is heading back to his boyhood side. The 23-year-old left-back, who bagged two goals and three assists for Vallecano last season as he missed just 21 minutes of the La Liga campaign, has signed a four-year deal in Madrid and will offer immediate competition on that side of defence. feed Garcia has already spoken openly about his plans back with Real, giving fans an insight into what they can expect from him next season. Left-back has been a tricky position for Ancelotti. Usual starter Ferland Mendy has regularly struggled with injuries and, with the versatile David Alaba also sidelined for parts of last season, it was over to versatile midfielder Eduardo Camavinga to help out at the back. While Camavinga enjoyed some excellent run-outs at full-back, he has made it clear that he sees his future in his preferred position of midfield, and the arrival of Garcia should help the Frenchman stick to his favourite role. Garcia becomes the first signing of the summer for Real, who are expected to follow this one up with the    100m acquisition of Jude Bellingham from Borussia Dortmund.
