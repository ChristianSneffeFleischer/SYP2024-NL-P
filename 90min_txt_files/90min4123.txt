Gianluca Busio is set to depart Sporting Kansas City after agreeing to sign for Serie A side Venezia. Busio is one of the United States    most exciting prospects. Signing for Sporting KC as a Homegrown Player aged just 15, he made his MLS debut back in 2018. He soon rose to become an important figure in the first team and already has 70 senior appearances to his name, despite being just 19. According to Fabrizio Romano, Busio is set to take the next step in his career by signing for Venezia. Several other clubs were thought to be interested in the midfielder, including fellow Serie A side Sassuolo, who have a terrific reputation for developing young players. Despite this, Busio has opted for newly promoted Venezia and he will arrive in Italy imminently to finalise the deal. Sporting KC will initially receive    4m for his services, although this will increase after add-ons. Venezia are returning to Serie A for the first time since 2002 this season after winning the Serie B playoffs last term. This could turn out to be an inspired piece of business with Busio backed by many to go right to the top. He has already caught the attention of his country, representing the United States at various youth levels before being handed his senior USMNT debut earlier this month.
