Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has confirmed it remains the club   s intention to try and sign a new striker this summer to boost the squad ahead of next season. City were unsuccessful in their efforts to sign Harry Kane from Tottenham last summer following the departure of Sergio Aguero and have typically been operating this season with the likes of Phil Foden, Jack Grealish and others in a    false nine    role. It remains to be seen whether City could resurrect their interest in Kane, who want to assess Tottenham   s progress and long-term vision before he re-commits to them. City have also been heavily linked with Erling Haaland in the past, while Robert Lewandowski is potentially going to come onto the market but is already a potential Manchester United target. The reigning Premier League champions have even been linked with Karim Benzema, who could be pushed out of contention depending on Bernabeu incomings.    I think the club needs a striker, definitely,    Guardiola said.    I think the club is going to try, it hasn   t happened but in the end we adapt. We adapt to the players and never complain; they are too good for me. I admire them and I like to work with them.
