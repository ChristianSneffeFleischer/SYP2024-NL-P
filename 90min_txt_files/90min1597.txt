Paris Saint-Germain advisor Luis Campos has hit out at Chelsea over the Blues' failure to complete the paperwork needed for Hakim Ziyech's proposed loan in January. The two sides had agreed the terms of an agreement for the Morocco international to spend the remainder of the season with the Ligue 1 leaders, but issues with the paperwork emerged soon after the deadline and the transfer ultimately collapsed. PSG, who 90min understands were livid with the breakdown, have accused Chelsea of failing to complete what should have been a simple procedure, although the Blues have pointed to alleged technological failures in the offices of Ligue 1's authorities. Ultimately, it means PSG failed to bolster in attack in January and Chelsea retained Ziyech - something Campos was happy to criticise. "We had the player with us, we had done everything. But as with all transfers, you need all three parties to work well," he told Telefoot. "In this case it worked very well for Paris Saint-Germain, it also worked well with Ziyech. Unfortunately, it didn   t work well for the last party."
