Sergi Roberto's Barcelona contract talks have stalled with the midfielder's current deal set to expire at the end of the season. Roberto was widely expected to depart Catalonia this past summer, only for the club to U-turn after he agreed a significant pay cut. Despite this, he is not a popular figure with certain sections of the Bar  a fanbase. Some see him symbolising the club's dramatic underachievement in recent years and he has even been jeered by supporters at games this season. Roberto's current contract expires in summer 2022 and despite reports last month suggesting an agreement had been reached for a two-year extension, it has been reported that talks have stalled. News of negotiations faltering was first broken by La Cadena Cope and Mundo Deportivo have now added some detail. The outlet contacted Roberto's agent, Josep Maria Orobitg, who confirmed that discussions had halted. Saying that, he did also reveal that talks could resume at anytime. If an agreement is not sealed before 31 December, the player will be free to agree a free transfer with clubs outside of Spain. Whether he would have many suitors on his current wages is another issue.  Despite not being a universally popular figure, he has featured regularly for Barcelona this season, making six La Liga appearances and also featuring in both of his side's Champions League games. However, the Blaugrana have not made a good start to the campaign.  They are currently ninth in the table, most recently falling to a poor 2-0 defeat at the hands of Atletico Madrid.
