Bayern Munich sporting director Hasan Salihamidzic has confirmed the Bundesliga side are interested in signing Borussia Monchengladbach goalkeeper Yann Sommer. Following the season-ending injury to Manuel Neuer, who broke his leg on a skiing holiday after the World Cup, Bayern have been on the hunt for a new goalkeeper and 90min understands Sommer is on their wish list. The Swiss international had previously been a target for Manchester United but the Red Devils' belief that he is heading to Munich contributed to their decision to sign Jack Butland on a six-month loan from Crystal Palace instead. Asked about Bayern's interest in Sommer, Salihamidzic tried to cool the situation but did confess that the goalkeeper is being discussed at the Allianz Arena. "Manuel Neuer's injury hits us hard, of course," he told Sky Germany. "We're going to the training camp now, of course we're checking our possibilities and options, and we'll make a decision in the new future. "I don't like to talk about players from other clibs, but [Sommer] is definitely an issue, of course." Bayern had attempted to convince Monaco to terminate Alexander Nubel's loan but the 26-year-old, who the Bavarians see as Neuer's natural successor, has already confirmed he does not want to return to Bayern if the plan is for him to be a backup. Club CEO Oliver Kahn later spoke to Bild about the club's ongoing search for a new goalkeeper. "We are discussing various options without hesitation," he began. "But replacing Manuel Neuer during the winter break is of course extremely difficult, especially since not many clubs want to give up their number one goalkeeper."
