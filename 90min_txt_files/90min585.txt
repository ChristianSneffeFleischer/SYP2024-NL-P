The Reds had been keen to avoid triggering the clause, which must be paid in one lump sum, but informed Leipzig of their willingness to do so on Friday evening, just hours before it expired. With a deal now formally agreed between the two clubs, Liverpool are ready to put Szoboszlai through a medical this weekend with a view to making the Hungary international their second signing of the summer. Personal terms have already been agreed with the 22-year-old, who informed Leipzig of his desire to join Liverpool before the bid arrived. Sources close to Liverpool believe that, should all go according to plan, Szoboszlai's move to Anfield could be wrapped up in the coming days. feed Newcastle had been interested in signing Szoboszlai earlier in the window but instead turned their focus to Italian midfielder Sandro Tonali, who is set to move to St James' Park from AC Milan in a deal worth around  Â£60m.

Liverpool are also among the sides interested in Celta Vigo starlet Gabri Veiga, who has attracted significant interest from across the Premier League.
