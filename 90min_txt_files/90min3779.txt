Atlanta United are set to sign exciting Argentine talent Thiago Almada from Velez this winter, according to reports. The Five Stripes have been pursuing the 20-year-old for some time and although they didn't manage to get a deal over the line in the summer window, that was seen as more of a delay than a failure. Almada himself recently confirmed that "everything is still on track" with his Atlanta United move, even if Europe remained his preferred destination.    The [Atlanta United move] was close. It did not happen, but everything is still on track. Right now I am calm and enjoying [Velez]. I will take the decision with my family, but if an offer comes, I   d like to leave. I prefer to go to Europe.

At his best playing at the point of midfield behind the striker, Almada is at his best connecting play and splitting open defenses with his precision passing, and leading counter-attacks with his direct, dynamic dribbling. With MLS set as the benchmark league, Almada rates at 89/99 for attacking output, 92 for ball retention & 98 for link up, via @smarterscoutCheck his actions map.
