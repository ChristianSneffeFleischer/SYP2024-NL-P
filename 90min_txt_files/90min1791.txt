Wolverhampton Wanderers have announced the signing of Craig Dawson from West Ham United. The 32-year-old had spent the last three seasons in east London but slid down David Moyes' pecking order this term. Dawson came close to leaving West Ham in the summer and while a move away did not materialise at the time, he has now completed a transfer to Wolves on two-and-a-half year contract. He becomes Wolves' fourth signing of the January window, with Julen Lopetegui having already added Matheus Cunha, Mario Lemina and Pablo Sarabia to his squad. West Ham confirmed in a statement that they did not want to let Dawson leave, but sanctioned the move regardless. "Craig made very clear his wish to be granted the move for personal reasons, and whilst the Club was reluctant to agree to the transfer, he leaves with our thanks and appreciation, and we wish him well in his future career," a statement from West Ham read.
