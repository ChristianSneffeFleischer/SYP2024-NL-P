Joan Laporta has warned Barcelona's European rivals that four players have been deemed 'not for sale' at Camp Nou. The Blaugrana find themselves in a real financial struggle and must raise at least    26m before they can even consider making new signings in order to comply with La Liga's new financial rules, prompting reports that clubs could begin to target a number of their players. Speaking to Cadena SER, Laporta insisted that Barcelona will have no issues in the transfer market going forward and named four players who he views as unsellable: Marc-Andre ter Stegen, Frenkie de Jong, Ousmane Dembele and Ansu Fati. "Ter Stegen and De Jong? We are very happy with both. Neither are for sale. Frenkie has significant value, several clubs are interested in him, but he is not for sale," he said. "[Dembele] is not for sale. At the right time we will come to his renewal, he is one of the most important players on the team. He is one of the cornerstones. Whenever he plays, he creates space. Yesterday he scored a magnificent goal." Asked about Fati, Laporta stressed that the winger is not for sale as part of a wider warning that no Barcelona players are available on the transfer market. "There is no one from the first team for sale," Laporta explained. "Not Ansu Fati nor anyone else." Manchester United continue to be linked with De Jong, while it's Paris Saint-Germain who have dominated the headlines when it comes to Dembele, but Laporta was adamant that Barcelona do not have to sell players to make money.
