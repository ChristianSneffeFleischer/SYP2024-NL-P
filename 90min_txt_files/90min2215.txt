Al Nassr have offered Cristiano Ronaldo a contract that could make him the highest paid footballer in history, 90min understands. The 37-year-old sensationally left Manchester United by mutual agreement earlier this month after he criticised the club's players, manager and hierarchy in an explosive interview with Piers Morgan. Ronaldo, who is currently away at the World Cup with Portugal, has been targeted by clubs in Saudi Arabia before, and turned down the opportunity to join Al-Hilal in the summer despite being offered over  £300m to do so. 90min previously revealed that Al Hilal were preparing a fresh offer for Ronaldo, but it's believed they have turned their attention to Lionel Messi and other priorities - paving the way for Al Nassr to try and engineer a move of their own. Ronaldo's current intention is to remain in Europe, where he can continue to compete in the Champions League, but sources have confirmed to 90min that Al Nassr have put forward a blockbuster contract offer to take him to Saudi Arabia.
