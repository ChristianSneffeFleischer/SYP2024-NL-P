Newly promoted Leeds United are keen to continue their summer of spending with a move for Leicester winger Demarai Gray. The 24-year-old has been told he can leave King Power Stadium this summer, and a suitable bid is likely to be accepted as he has just a year remaining on his contract. Gray has not yet featured in Leicester's Premier League campaign, which has begun with three consecutive victories; one of which was a resounding - and surprising - 5-2 mauling of Manchester City on their own patch, headlined by yet another Jamie Vardy hat-trick. It could be destination Elland Road for Gray, with MailOnline Sport reporting that the Championship winners may look to bring the England Under-21 international to Yorkshire. Further details are sketchy to say the least, but Gray's arrival would certainly increase competition for places in the wide areas. Jack Harrison and Helder Costa have started the season in good touch, but a long campaign that will require rotation means regular action would probably be afforded to the Leicester winger by manager Marcelo Bielsa. Gray's fall from grace has coincided with the arrival of Cengiz Under on a season-long loan deal, as well as the continued emergence of Harvey Barnes. Add Ayoze Perez, James Maddison and Marc Albrighton into the mix, and it's easy to understand why his playing time has been limited. During his Foxes career, Gray has made 132 appearances in the Premier League. But a meagre return of ten goals and nine assists in that time point to a disappointing end product, something that Brendan Rodgers would appear to be unable to look past.
