Chelsea manager Frank Lampard intends on making multiple signings in the upcoming transfer window, in a bid to refresh his squad and strengthen in key areas. The west London club were banned by FIFA from making any signings last summer after being found guilty of breaching the rules regarding signing academy players. After a successful appeal, the ban was lifted in time for the recent January window, but the Blues ended up not recruiting any new additions.  Lampard has impressed many with his focus on bringing through younger players into the first team -  a practice not often prioritised at the club in recent years. With the likes of Tammy Abraham, Reece James and Mason Mount now part of an established core at Stamford Bridge, the manager now wants to add more experienced players to his side, in order to close the gap to the likes of Liverpool and Manchester City. "I'm certainly excited about the squad we've got, with the young players and if we can get a few additions for areas I feel we need," Lampard told the club's official magazine (as quoted by the Daily Mail) "We didn't bring in anyone in January, it didn't work out to be right for us at the time, and last summer we couldn't bring anyone in, so those windows are gone and we haven't changed. So I am excited about the squad we've got, if we can freshen up in the right areas we all know that." Chelsea are said to be preparing for some of their players to depart at the end of the season, including veteran wingers Willian and Pedro. Midfielder N'Golo Kant   has also been linked with a move elsewhere, which could free up funds for multiple arrivals to Stamford Bridge.
