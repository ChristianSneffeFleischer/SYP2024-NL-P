Tottenham have confirmed the signing of Wolves' Matt Doherty on a four-year deal.  The Ireland international becomes Spurs' third signing of the summer window after the club brought in Southampton's Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg and free agent Joe Hart earlier this month.  It's time to #WelcomeDoherty!        pic.twitter.com/NOE5EEvMoA Doherty emerged as a surprise target for Jose Mourinho a couple of weeks ago and is an experienced Premier League player who has played a big part in Wolves' rise over recent years. Since making his debut in 2010, the Irish right-back has made over 300 appearances for the club. The Irishman recently changed representation to super-agent Jorge Mendes, a close associate of Mourinho who is influential in the running of Wolves. And with links regarding the 28-year-old's move to north London only surfacing recently, it appears Spurs have gone about this purchase with impressive efficiency.  Wolves were initially holding out for a fee in the  £20m for Doherty, but Daniel Levy looks to have negotiated his final price down to around the  £15m mark - with  £12m being stumped up immediately. The Ireland international has proved a hit in the Premier League following Wolves' promotion in 2018. Deployed as an aggressive right wing-back under Nuno Espirito Santo, Doherty has made 19 goal contributions in 74 top-flight appearances. His impressive work down the right flank has helped his side back-to-back seventh-place finishes and a Europa League quarter-final.
