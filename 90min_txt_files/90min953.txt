Tottenham Hotspur have told Harry Kane they will not sell him this summer, 90min understands. Kane's contract expires at the end of the 2023/24 season and the two parties are no closer to agreeing terms over a fresh deal. The striker has been courted by some of Europe's top clubs in recent months, with the likes of Bayern Munich, Manchester United and PSG interested. Meanwhile, Real Madrid are ready to step up a pursuit of Kane following Karim Benzema's shock move to Saudi Pro League champions Al-Ittihad. 90min previously reported the belief across the continent was that Kane would not be allowed to leave Spurs this summer. And sources have now confirmed to 90min Tottenham communicated to Kane that he will not be sold for any price after they had informed him Ange Postecoglou would be taking the head coach job. Kane was told that even if an interested party such as Real Madrid came in with an offer of  Â£100m, it wouldn't be deemed acceptable. There remains a belief at Spurs that Kane, who became the club's all-time leading scorer in February, could yet sign a new contract in N17. feed In terms of incomings at Tottenham this summer, 90min reported on Tuesday Postecoglou has green-lit some of their transfer plans already. Spurs will pursue Leicester City midfielder James Maddison, who is also wanted by Newcastle United. Brentford's David Raya is high on their shortlist of goalkeepers, with club captain Hugo Lloris publicly revealing last week his desire to leave Tottenham. A new centre-back is also a priority for Spurs and their list of targets include Manchester United's Harry Maguire and Manchester City's Aymeric Laporte.
