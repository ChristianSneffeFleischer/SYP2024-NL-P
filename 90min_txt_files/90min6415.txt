Real Madrid are reportedly resigned to selling James Rodriguez for a cut-price fee this summer, opening the door to Arsenal, Everton, Manchester United and Wolves to make their moves.  Rodriguez has made just one league appearance since October for Los Blancos after struggling to overcome an injury-ravaged start to the season. His start against Real Sociedad last month was his sole post-lockdown appearance, and he has been left out of the four matches since, with Madrid locking down top spot in La Liga without him.   The Colombian was close to joining Atl  tico Madrid in the summer but a move failed to come to fruition, and he has now entered the final year of his contract - meaning this summer will be Real's last chance to earn a fee for the player who turns 29 next week.

The story goes that, in recognition of how difficult it will be to sell him, Real have virtually halved their asking price since last summer, and will now accept something in the region of    20-25m for his services.  Madrid see that as a 'giveaway' for a player of his abilities, but their hand has been forced, and a quartet of Premier League clubs are touted to take advantage.   Marca lead with Everton, whose manager Carlo Ancelotti attempted to take him to Napoli last summer, saying they are his 'maximum supporter.'
