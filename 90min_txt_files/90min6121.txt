West Ham are preparing a bid for Brighton defender Shane Duffy, who's valued at  £10m by the Seagulls. After establishing himself as a mainstay in Chris Hughton's defence alongside Lewis Dunk following their 2017 promotion to the Premier League, Duffy has slipped down the pecking order since last summer's arrival of progressive coach Graham Potter - with superior ball-player Adam Webster often favoured. Thus, Brighton's player of the 2018/19 season made just 19 appearances in the top-flight last term and fuelled speculation fuelled speculation regarding his future with a recent  Twitter  post in which he suggested his time at the club was coming to an end. The Irishman's set to attract plenty of domestic interest if he is to go on the market this summer, and the Daily Mirror (via the Brighton & Hove Independent) report that David Moyes is keen on reuniting with the Brighton centre-half in a potential  £10m deal.  Moyes worked with the 28-year-old during his time as Everton manager. Although Duffy spent much of the Scotsman's tenure at Goodison Park out on loan after emerging from the academy in 2010. Nevertheless, West Ham are said to be set on bolstering their defence this summer and may be forced to replace Winston Reid and Fabian Balbuena - who are both linked with moves away from east London. However, a spanner in the works of any potential deal are the futures of Duffy's fellow Brighton centre-halves.
