Barcelona could move for Arsenal right-back Hector Bellerin if they are unable to land Juan Foyth in the final days of the summer transfer window, 90min understands. Head coach Xavi is keen to bring in reinforcements at right-back, repeatedly insisting that current option Sergino Dest has been 'made aware' of his plans. Summer signing Jules Kounde started at right-back in Sunday's 4-0 win against Real Valladolid, while Ousmane Dembele has been used as a wing-back already this season. 90min reported earlier on Tuesday that Dest is now a target for Manchester United, and Bar  a want to sign cover regardless of whether the American stays or goes. They have been heavily courting former Tottenham defender Foyth, who is also capable of playing at centre-back and in defensive midfield, in recent weeks but have failed to reach an agreement with Villarreal. With so little time left in the window, Barcelona could turn their attentions to Bellerin, who has been deemed surplus to requirements at Arsenal. The Gunners are looking to sell Bellerin but Barcelona have enquired about an initial loan instead. There's also a possibility of him leaving the Emirates Stadium for free. If moves for Foyth and Bellerin both fail, Thomas Meunier of Borussia Dortmund is also under consideration, but Bar  a believe a deal for either of the former two would be easier. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  &  Toby Cudworth  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Lucas Paqueta's move to West Ham, Chelsea's plans to sign Anthony Gordon, Wesley Fofana and Arsen Zakharyan and the latest from Old Trafford.
