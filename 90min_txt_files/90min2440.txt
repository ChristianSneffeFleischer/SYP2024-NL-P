Real Madrid are putting plans in place to bring Jude Bellingham to the Spanish capital, sources have confirmed to 90min. 90min revealed last week that Bellingham had not yet made a decision on his future and that he was not planning to do so before this winter's World Cup. Real Madrid understand Bellingham's stance, but they are making sure that the England star is fully aware of their interest and what is on offer at Los Blancos. 90min understands that Real Madrid's interest is strong despite already investing heavily in their midfield with both Eduardo Camavinga and Aurelien Tchouameni arriving in the last year. It was presumed by many that Uruguayan star Fede Valverde would be the man to drop into a three alongside Camavinga and Tchouameni. But Real Madrid sources have confirmed to 90min that they are happy that he can play in numerous roles, including out wide where he has been excelling this year, meaning they would still have room for Bellingham in their system. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey,  Toby Cudworth  and  Sean Walsh  bring you a brand new episode of Talking Transfers. The team discuss Jude Bellingham's future, Bayern Munich's interest in Harry Kane, widespread Premier League interest in Mykhaylo Mudryk and plenty more.  Available on  all audio platforms.
