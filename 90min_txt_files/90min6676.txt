Leicester are prepared to stand their ground and insist that Ben Chilwell is not for sale this summer, despite interest from Premier League heavyweights Chelsea and Manchester City. The coronavirus outbreak has done little to deter Chelsea from spending lavishly this summer, having agreed a    60m deal with RB Leipzig for highly sought-after striker Timo Werner on Thursday. Bankrolled by the  £89m sale of Eden Hazard last summer, the Blues are set to to turn their attention to Leicester left-back Chilwell, but the Foxes are prepared to dig their heals in and will only listen to eye-watering offers for the 23-year-old. According to a report in the Telegraph, Leicester have no intention of selling the England international.  Although they have refused to place a valuation on Chilwell, the report states they would require a bid to rival that paid by Manchester United for Harry Maguire last summer before Leicester will even start considering doing business. United forked out  £85m to bring Maguire from the King Power to Old Trafford. The Foxes currently sit comfortably in the Premier League's Champions League places, eight points clear of fifth place Man Utd and above Chelsea in fourth. The club are keen to establish themselves as a regular top-four side, with 90min revealing in April that they were confident of tying down Chilwell, James Maddison, Caglar Soyuncu and Youri Tielemans to new long-term deals in a show of the club's ambition. Leicester have proven to be stubborn negotiators when it comes to selling their prized assets in recent seasons, with the club holding out for  £32m for N'Golo Kant   in 2016, and  £60m for Riyad Mahrez two years later before the Maguire deal last summer.
