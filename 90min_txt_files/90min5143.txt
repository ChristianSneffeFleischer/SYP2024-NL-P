Newcastle are interested in signing Manchester United outcast Phil Jones on loan in January. Jones has been out of favour for some time at Old Trafford, making just eight appearances in all competitions last season. In the summer, United were keen to sell the defender but no deal materialised.  Jones was then left out of United's 25-man Premier League squad at the beginning of the season, alongside Sergio Romero. Now, Steve Bruce could be prepared to throw the England international a lifeline.  According to the Northern Echo, Newcastle could sign the centre-back on loan in January. Jones himself is understood to be keen on the deal, recognising that - despite having two and a half years left to run on his contract - his United career is over.  While the Magpies would consider a loan move until the end of the season, owner Mike Ashley does not want to commit to a permanent signing. There is also the matter of Jones'  Â£100,000-a-week wages, some of which United would have to cover if the signing is to go ahead.  Bruce has been looking to bolster his defensive ranks for some time. Arsenal's Rob Holding seemed set to arrive in the summer, only for the Gunners to pull the plug on the deal at the eleventh hour.
