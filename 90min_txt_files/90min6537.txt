Tottenham have confirmed that Jan Vertonghen and backup keeper Michel Vorm have signed short-term contracts keeping them at the club until the end of the season.  Both players' deals were up at the end of June, but have signed up to cover the remainder of the 2019/20 campaign. A Spurs statement reads: "We can confirm that defender Jan Vertonghen and goalkeeper Michel Vorm have agreed to extend their existing contracts with the club until the end of the 2019/20 season. We can confirm that @JanVertonghen and @Vorm_Official have agreed to extend their existing contracts with the Club until the end of the 2019/20 season.#THFC        #COYS "Both players    contracts were due to expire at the end of this month and this extension means they will now be available to play for us for the remainder of the current Premier League season." Vertonghen has long been linked with an exit on a free transfer this summer, and the news that he has signed a short-term deal - similar to the one Adam Lallana signed at Liverpool - does little to quell that speculation.  Reports in Italy - sourced by the Mail - say Roma have offered an initial two-year deal to the 33-year-old, who was an unused substitute in the 1-1 draw with Manchester United on Friday.  In the case of Vorm, the 37-year-old returned for a second spell with the club in October and has made just one FA Cup appearance since, but the experience and cover he offers remains highly valued by the club.
