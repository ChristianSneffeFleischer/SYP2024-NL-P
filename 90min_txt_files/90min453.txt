The brother of Ajax defender Jurrien Timber appears to have posted an image of the Dutchman's farewell party as his move to Arsenal edges closer. Arsenal have agreed to pay an initial    42m, plus a further    5m in add-ons, to seal the signature of the 22-year-old, who has been training away from the Ajax first team while the finishing touches on his Emirates switch are thrashed out.  It appears as though Arsenal fans' wait for Timber's arrival could soon be coming to an end as the defender's older brother, Shamier, has now posted what appears to be a sign from a farewell party that also features Jurrien wearing an Arsenal shirt.

Timber has already undergone a medical with Arsenal and is set to become their second signing of the summer any day now, following Kai Havertz's  £65m switch from Chelsea. He should soon be followed through the door by West Ham midfielder Declan Rice after Arsenal agreed to a payment structure for their proposed  £105m acquisition of the England international. feed With Arsenal now bolstering in all their priority positions, the focus could soon turn to outgoings as the Gunners have a number of fringe stars who could be sold. The likes of Kieran Tierney and Nuno Tavares have attracted interest, while midfielder Thomas Partey was granted permission to discuss a move to Saudi Arabia which is not currently believed to be in the Ghanaian's plans. In attack, there is plenty of interest in striker Folarin Balogun after his return from his loan with Stade Reims. A handful of Premier League sides are keen on the 22-year-old, who is also wanted in mainland Europe.
