Albania striker Armando Broja has signed a new six-year contract at Chelsea. The 20-year-old enjoyed an impressive loan spell at Southampton last season and was the subject of transfer interest from Everton, Newcastle and West Ham over the summer. However, a move away never materialised and he has now committed his future to the Blues, penning a new deal until 2028 on Friday. Speaking to Chelsea's club channels, Broja said: "I   m lost for words really just thinking about it. It   s the club I   ve dreamed of playing for my whole life, the club that I support and the club that I love. I   ve been here since I was a boy so it   s a surreal feeling for me and my family. "To be able to put on the blue shirt with the first team is a dream come true. It's amazing every minute that you get to play on the pitch because this is one of the biggest clubs in the world.
