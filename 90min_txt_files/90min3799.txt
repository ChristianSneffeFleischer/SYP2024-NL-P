Manchester United are paying increasingly close attention to Monaco's midfield starlet Aurelien Tchouameni, 90min has learned. The exciting player has made the breakthrough into the senior France squad this year and along with fellow teenager Eduardo Camavinga, is seen as the future of their national side. United are in the market for a new midfielder in 2022, having already considered a bid for one in the summer. They spoke to a number of targets before the start of the season, but ended up prioritising other positions.  Now, with Paul Pogba   s long-term future far from certain, they could sign two midfielders     but a holding player is understood to be the priority. United are in the running to recruit Declan Rice - a player they have liked for over two years - while his England colleagues Kalvin Phillips and Jude Bellingham are also being scouted extensively. In addition, Tchouameni has emerged on their radar following a string of impressive displays for both club and country.  Chelsea had been in talks with the youngster in the summer, and had considered a deal that would have seen him joining in the future. But they instead made a move to sign Saul on-loan from Atletico Madrid. The Blues could regret not making that deal as it isn   t just United who are taking a keen interest in the 21-year-old. Real Madrid, Atletico Madrid, Juventus, Inter and Bayern Munich are all hugely impressed with Tchouameni who is now one of the most wanted young players in world football.
