Nottingham Forest are closing in on the signing of Palmeiras midfielder Danilo, 90min can confirm. The 21-year-old midfielder was tentatively pursued by Arsenal last summer but the Gunners opted not to pull the trigger on a move, allowing Forest to now swoop in and strike an agreement with Palmeiras worth around  Â£16m instead. Danilo is heading to England for a medical which, if all goes to plan, will see him become Forest's second signing of the January window and their 24th in total since promotion to the Premier League. He is set to follow former teammate Gustavo Scarpa, who left Palmeiras when his contract expired at the end of December.
