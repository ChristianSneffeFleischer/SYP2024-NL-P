Out of favour Manchester United goalkeeper Sergio Romero has put his Cheshire mansion up for sale, with the Argentine almost certain to be leaving Old Trafford this summer.  Romero was long regarded as the Premier League's best second-choice goalkeeper, but he has slipped down the United pecking order this season following Dean Henderson's return from his two-year loan spell at Sheffield United. With Lee Grant also on United's books, Romero is now seemingly the Red Devil's fourth choice. Romero's contract expires in June, and he has been tipped to exit the club for some time having said his goodbyes to members of staff at United's Carrington training ground in December. Romero is currently back in his native Argentina spending time with his family ahead of a potential summer transfer, and an Old Trafford departure is now edging ever closer after the Sun reported that the goalkeeper has put his  Â£3.5m Cheshire mansion on the market. The 34-year-old last featured for the United first team during their Europa League quarter-final victory over Copenhagen in August, but his frustration with his situation at the club is said to have begun the month before, when David de Dea was given the nod for the FA Cup semi-final clash against Chelsea - despite Romero starting United's previous five matches in the competition. Having started nine of United's 11 matches in the 2019/20 Europa League, Romero was then dropped for De Gea again for United's semi-final defeat to Sevilla.
