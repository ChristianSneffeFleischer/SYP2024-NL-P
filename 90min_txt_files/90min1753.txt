Fulham have agreed a deal with Arsenal over full-back Cedric Soares, 90min understands. It would mean Cedric linking up with fellow countryman Marco Silva at Craven Cottage and playing for his third Premier League club after initially moving to England with Southampton in 2015. The proposed deal is a loan until the end of the season, but it will require some reshuffling in the Fulham squad in order to stay within the maximum number of permitted domestic loans. Premier League rules dictate that clubs may not have more than two players on loan from another Premier League or English side at any one time. As things stand, Fulham currently have centre-back Shane Duffy on loan from Brighton and winger Daniel James on loan from Leeds. Listen now as  Scott Saunders  hosts  Graeme Bailey  and  Toby Cudworth  to discuss the latest transfer news. On today's agenda: Dusan Vlahovic, Anthony Gordon, Enzo Fernandes, Amadou Onana, Malo Gusto, Nicolo Zaniolo, Pedro Porro, Weston McKennie, Milan Skriniar, Maiximo Perrone & more!
