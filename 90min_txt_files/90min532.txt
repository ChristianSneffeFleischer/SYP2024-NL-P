Roberto Firmino has completed a move to Saudi Pro League side Al Ahli after his contract with Liverpool expired at the end of the 2022/23 season. The Brazilian has become the latest start name to take his talents to the Middle East, with the likes of Karim Benzema, N'Golo Kante and Kalidou Koulibaly heading to Saudi Arabia this transfer window. Firmino will link up with ex-Chelsea goalkeeper Edouard Mendy at Al Ahli as well as former Swansea City winger Modou Barrow. Al Ahli announced the signing of Firmino late on Tuesday night, with the forward penning a three-year contract. Prior to this move, Firmino had been linked with various top clubs across Europe, including Barcelona and Real Madrid. manual Firmino opted to call time on his Liverpool career after eight memorable seasons on Merseyside, helping the Reds to seven trophies. Explaining his decision to leave back in May, Firmino said: "It is time, unfortunately. The cycle here is ended and I understand it is time to go. "I am very proud for everything that I have done here with the team, what we achieved together and the beautiful history we made together. It was absolutely incredible. We are leaving a great legacy."
