Paul Pogba is prepared to begin the Premier League season with Manchester United but will make a decision on his future before the transfer window closes. The Frenchman has entered the final 12 months of his contract and is delaying signing an extension while he considers all his options, which include signing a new deal, transferring to Paris Saint-Germain or waiting to leave on a free transfer.

However, as noted by The Telegraph, he will take the few weeks that follow to consider his options and he is prepared to make an official decision about his future before the transfer window closes at the end of August. While it may not be his final decision, Pogba will have to settle on whether to leave for PSG or stick around and give himself an extra 11 months to figure out what he wants to do with his career. The response from United fans could end up being key to Pogba's decision. Supporters will have a chance to voice their feelings towards the 28-year-old, and a more positive response than has been shown by PSG supporters - a banner was unveiled at the PSG training ground urging Pogba to stay away as a result of his family's support of rivals Marseille - could convince the midfielder to stay. Should he choose to go, it will be up to PSG to agree on a transfer fee with United, who remain keen to keep Pogba in the hope of convincing him to sign a new contract over the coming days. According to Le Parisien, United will demand anywhere between    75m and    100m ( £64m and  £85m) to sell Pogba this summer, but PSG are not prepared to get anywhere close to that fee for a player who is on track to be a free agent next summer.
