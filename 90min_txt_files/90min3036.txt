Barcelona president Joan Laporta has confirmed the club will now look to target a new defender in the summer transfer window. The Blaugrana have already brought in Andreas Christensen on a free transfer from Chelsea but most of their business has been at the other end of the field. Midfielder Franck Kessie and forwards Raphinha and Robert Lewandowski have joined, while Ousmane Dembele has signed a new contract to stay at Camp Nou as well. Laporta has now revealed that Barcelona are finished in attack and will now look to strengthen their defence over the next few weeks. "Now it's time to work on the defence," Laporta told TUDN. "Xavi has us focused on a series of players and I hope that the Catalans can have a few more joys. "My dream is for Bar  a to become a world reference again and we are working for it. If the economy does not recover, it will be very difficult. We are achieving it, but we have to work even more. Football does not wait. You have to do it now. With Dembele, Raphinha, Lewandowski, Kessie, Auba, Ferran... I think Mateu Alemany and Jordi Cruyff are doing a good job." Barcelona are looking to butt heads with Chelsea in pursuit of Sevilla centre-back Jules Kounde, while they are also expected to negotiate with the Blues themselves over deals for both Cesar Azpilicueta and Marcos Alonso. Despite battling clubs with stronger finances, Laporta insisted the allure of Barcelona is strong enough to sign any player.
