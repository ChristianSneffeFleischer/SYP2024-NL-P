Cristiano Ronaldo's long-term future at Juventus is said to be in doubt as a result of his 'unromantic' relationship with the club, but extending his stay in Turin cannot be ruled out either.  The 35-year-old recently returned to action against Spezia after recovering from the coronavirus, marking the occasion with two second half goals. Ronaldo will be looking to get off the mark in his first Champions League game of the season on Wednesday when the Bianconeri take on Ferencvaros.   Happy to be back and help the team with two goals!?? Well done team ?? Always Fino Alla Fine ??  #123 #forzajuve A post shared by  Cristiano Ronaldo (@cristiano) on Nov 1, 2020 at 9:19am PST Ronaldo - who made the high-profile switch to Turin from Real Madrid in 2018 - has two years remaining on his current deal, although there have been suggestions he had previously been offered around as Juventus were struggling to deal with his hefty wages.  Tuttosport report that the Portuguese star still remains very keen on the idea of playing on past 2022 (which is when his current deal is due to expire), even though he will be 37 by then. Indeed, he revealed back in February that he is aiming to play 'hundreds more games' despite reaching the latter stages of his career.  But while his relationship with the Old Lady is described as 'solid', it's claimed he holds an 'unromantic' connection with the Italian giants.  As a result, this has made his long-term future at the club a 'complex' matter, especially with Paris Saint-Germain in the equation. While Tuttosport do allude to the fact that some are suggesting he could make the switch to the Parc des Princes, this is merely a hypothesis at the moment.
