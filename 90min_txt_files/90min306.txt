Real Madrid winger Rodrygo has talked about the club's pursuits of Kylian Mbappe and Harry Kane. Los Blancos have been linked with the duo following the surprise departure of Karim Benzema to Saudi Pro League champions Karim Benzema this transfer window. Mbappe informed Paris Saint-Germain earlier this summer that he does not intend to extend his contract beyond 2024, and 90min understands they have told him he will not be allowed to leave for free next year, meaning a move could be completed before the window shuts. Meanwhile, Kane's representatives have informed Real Madrid of his desire to leave Tottenham before the expiry of his own contract next year. Bayern Munich have made several bids for the striker but Spurs are reluctant to even set an asking price and have knocked back all approaches so far. The view from across Europe is Tottenham will not allow Kane to be sold this summer, while Spurs are hopeful they can agree terms over a new contract. feed Speaking to Sport TV, Rodrygo admitted that he was unsure of Real Madrid's interest in Kane, though he would like to play alongside Mbappe. "At Real Madrid, it's very complicated, there are always rumours and this year there were rumours about Harry Kane," he said. "When I arrived in Madrid there was a lot of talk about [Paul] Pogba coming, so I don't have any information, we have to wait and see. Of course, I hope Mbappe comes because he will help us a lot. He is a real star, but we really don't know anything." With Benzema gone, Real Madrid's only natural number nine is loanee Joselu. Reports in Spain suggest that Carlo Ancelotti could use Jude Bellingham as a box-crashing number ten, with Rodrygo and Vinicius Junior utilised as inverted forwards.
