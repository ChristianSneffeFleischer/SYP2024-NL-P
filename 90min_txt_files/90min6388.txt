Tammy Abraham wants a new Chelsea contract that matches fellow academy graduate Callum Hudson-Odoi's  £130,000-per-week wages. Abraham has been one of the Blues' star performers this season, top scoring with 16 goals in all competitions. The England international currently has two years left to run on his current  £50,000-per-week deal at Stamford Bridge.  The Times have reported that Abraham is waiting to see who the club bring in during the upcoming transfer window before committing to the club. However, if he does decide to remain in the capital he is likely to push for wages that match those of Hudson-Odoi.  The winger penned a lucrative new five-year deal back in September and Abraham believes he is also entitled to a wage of over  £100,000.  When quizzed on the striker's contract situation recently, Chelsea manager Frank Lampard insisted that negotiating with the player was not his immediate concern.  "Tammy   s contract is not at a critical level and I will leave it to him and the club to discuss,    Lampard said.  The new Chelsea away kit.

You could see it in his demeanour through the week, that is what he needs to sustain all the time." After a lightning start to the season - when he netted seven times in his opening five games - Abraham's has failed to replicate this form more recently. He endured a miserable spell during the winter months, where he scored just three times, and has managed just one goal since lockdown ended in June.
