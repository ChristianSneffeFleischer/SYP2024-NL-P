Andreas Christensen has insisted he is not scared of competing with Gerard Pique for minutes in Barcelona's defence after sealing his free transfer to Camp Nou. Christensen let his contract with Chelsea expire this summer and jumped ship to Barcelona, where there is no guarantee of a starting place as Xavi already has Pique and Ronald Araujo to call upon, with Eric Garcia also on the fringes on the first team. Speaking in his official presentation on Thursday, Christensen did not shy away from the challenge ahead of him. "There is a lot of competition, but it's healthy. I can learn a lot from all the players, the defenders," Christensen said. "Pique has been around for a long time, he's a legend. "My goal is to play, that's what all footballers think. There is competition and, for me, it is healthy. It makes me improve and try harder. I don't want to say I'm competing with anyone by name because all the defenders are magnificent." Part of his willingness to fight for minutes stems from a lifelong dream to play for Barcelona, with Christensen insisting he would not expect to waltz straight into the starting lineup at such a great club. "I'm proud, it's a dream come true," the Dane said of his move. "Since I was little, it's been written that I wanted it to be this way. Thank you for making my dream come true and I hope to give me best.
