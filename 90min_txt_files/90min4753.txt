Everton are set to reignite their interest in Juventus midfielder Adrien Rabiot at the end of the season, according to reports in France.  Carlo Ancelotti was eager to sign Rabiot - who he brought through the ranks at PSG back in 2012 - last summer, but the clubs did not manage to get the deal over the line. The Frenchman has largely underwhelmed since joining Juventus in 2019, although he has featured regularly under Andrea Pirlo so far this season, racking up 28 appearances in all competitions.

According to France Football (via the Daily Mail), Everton are willing to spend    30m ( Â£26m) on the player, all of which would be profit for Juventus as he joined them on a free.  The Old Lady are well resourced in central midfield with Arthur, Rodrigo Bentancur, Weston McKennie, Aaron Ramsey and Nicolo Fagioli all able to play in the position. Recent reports state that because of this, Juventus would be open to severing ties with Rabiot in the summer.  One of the potential candidates to replace him could be Manchester United's Paul Pogba. Pogba's agent, Mino Raiola, confirmed that the player was unhappy at Old Trafford back in December and wanted to leave. Since then, his and United's fortunes have improved significantly, although his future remains uncertain.
