Lyon sporting director Juninho fears it's inevitable the club will lose a number of their stars this summer, including Manchester United target Moussa Dembele.  Les Gones' miraculous Champions League run was brought to an end by Bayern Munich on Wednesday night, as Hansi Flick's relentless outfit progressed to the final with a 3-0 win. The French side spurned plenty of good opportunities to take the lead before Serge Gnabry's ruthless opener. Rudi Garcia will certainly rue those squandered chances in the opening exchanges, and now the French boss is expected to see some of the key players from their underdog run leave the club this summer. Dynamic midfielder Houssem Aouar and chief goalscorer Dembele are two names touted with big-money moves away in the current transfer window,  with Juninho admitting it will be difficult to resist lucrative offers for the pair. "There are no presents. We will have to work," the former free-kick master said following their semi-final exit (via the Metro).    If we continue like this, we will be back in this competition. When you are well paid, you need motivation every day, we are going to concentrate on Ligue 1. There are the basics. "There will be departures, but I am not worried. When you have players who play very well in a competition like this, like Moussa and Houssem...we will have to show the same spirit to be back in the Champions League next season."
