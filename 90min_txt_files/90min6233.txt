 Borussia Dortmund are willing to sell Jadon Sancho to Manchester United for the 'right price', although the deal could hinge on whether the Red Devils secure Champions League football on Sunday.  Sancho enjoyed a highly productive 2019/2020 season, racking up 33 goal involvements in just 32 Bundesliga appearances. This came after he posted similarly impressive numbers during the 2018/2019 campaign.  Unsurprisingly his form has attracted plenty of suitors and United are understood to be at the front of the queue. According to the Independent, Dortmund are resigned to losing Sancho but will only sell him for the 'right price.'  The fee quoted in the report is  £55m, rising to  £80m with add-ons. This is considerably less than some of the other figures that have mentioned recently with Dortmund understood to want at least  £100m for one of their prize assets. This would smash United's  £89m transfer record that they shelled out for Paul Pogba back in 2016. 90min first reported that United were confident of securing a 2020 deal for Sancho back in September and the club's assurance has not wavered since - even amid the financial uncertainty created by COVID-19.  Sancho himself is keen for the move to happen but his enthusiasm could be dimmed if United fail to qualify for the Champions League. This eventuality could also harm the deal's likelihood by leaving the Red Devils short of the funds required to finance the 20-year-old's capture.
