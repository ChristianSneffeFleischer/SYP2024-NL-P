Barcelona head coach Xavi wants the media to stop linking Lionel Messi with a return to the club, urging them to 'leave him in peace'. Messi left Bar  a in the summer of 2021 after his contract expired and the club were unable to hand him a new one due to financial restraints. He went on to sign for Paris Saint-Germain on a free transfer. But ever since arriving in France, Messi has been heavily touted to return to Catalonia, and Xavi was again asked about such a prospect ahead of Barcelona's Champions League trip to Inter. "With Leo, let's see, but it's not the moment to talk about it right now," he said. "You know the love I have for him. He is a friend and I will always wish him the best. Bar  a is his home, but we're not doing him any favours speaking about [his future], either. "Let's leave him in peace to enjoy his time in Paris and wish him all the best."
