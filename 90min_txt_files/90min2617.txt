Everton manager Frank Lampard is growing frustrated with Chelsea's pursuit of Anthony Gordon and has revealed the club have set an internal deadline for a deal to be completed. 90min understands Chelsea remain hopeful of signing the winger before Thursday's hard deadline. However, Lampard revealed on Friday that, contrary to reports, the Toffees had not received a  Â£60m offer from the Blues for Gordon. Speaking ahead of Everton's trip to Brentford, the ex-Chelsea midfielder admitted he is tired of his former side's courting of his star forward and he won't put up with it for much longer. "We have drawn a red line. It is very difficult. I got asked last week, 'Will he [Gordon] be here at the end of the window?' It was an impossible question to answer, really. But I am working to try and put a squad together," Lampard said. "There absolutely has to come a time where we understand what the squad is going to be, especially a player of the level of Anthony.  "I have to know he is going be here and the good thing is here at the club, myself and everybody involved upstairs has the same kind of thinking. "I won't say where it [the cut-off point] is, but I think you understand I am getting very close to it."
