Pedro is poised to depart Chelsea with Roma set to sign the winger on a free transfer.  The 32-year-old arrived at Stamford Bridge from Barcelona back in 2015 and has enjoyed a successful career in west London. The World Cup winner has made over 200 appearances for the Blues, scoring 43 goals. The Spaniard's current contract expires on 30 June and although it remains unclear as to whether it will be extended until the end of the season, his long term future lies away from Chelsea.  According to AS, Juventus have expressed an interest in the player. I Bianconeri boss Maurizio Sarri was a big fan of Pedro during his time as Blues boss, selecting him on no less than 52 occasions as the club secured a top four finish and won the Europa League.  However, they have only conducted preliminary negotiations and Serie A rivals Roma appear to be in pole position to secure his services. La Lupa have been tracking Pedro for a several months and with the club on the lookout for bargains due to the financial uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, signing the forward on a free transfer represents smart business.  Juventus and Roma will return to Serie A action later this month with both sides having plenty to play for. Sarri's team will resume proceedings by facing Milan in the second leg of the two sides' Coppa Italia semi final on 12 June. The tie is currently evenly poised after a 1-1 draw at San Siro. Pedro's Stamford Bridge days are drawing to a close with interest high for the Chelsea man!
