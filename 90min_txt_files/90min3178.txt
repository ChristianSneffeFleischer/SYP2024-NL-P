Manchester United have finalised the signing of Dutch left-back Tyrell Malacia from Feyenoord. The 22-year-old had been expected to join Lyon this summer but the French side refused to meet Feyenoord's asking price and inadvertedly opened the door for United to swoop in and agree a fee of around    15m plus add-ons. Malacia, who leaves Feyenoord with 98 games of Eredivisie experience under his belt, was among the best left-backs in the Dutch top flight last season and is known to have caught the eye of new United manager Erik ten Hag, who was even seen on video telling his Ajax staff to 'take note' of the left-back during a match between the two sides. It was Ten Hag who pushed for Malacia to come to Old Trafford and United have now confirmed that the Dutch youngster has put pen to paper on a contract which will run until 2026, with an option to extend for a further year.  Malacia becomes United's first signing of the summer but should by no means be the last, with club officials actively pursuing a handful of other transfers. Barcelona midfielder Frenkie de Jong is the top target and United are in advanced talks over a deal which could cost them in excess of    80m. A    43m bid has also been lodged for Ajax centre-back Lisandro Martinez - who is also being targeted by Arsenal - while team-mate Antony is high on Ten Hag's wish list as well.
