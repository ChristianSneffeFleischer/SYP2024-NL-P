Milan have held talks with Roma regarding a January move for Nicolo Zaniolo, sources have told 90min. Giallorossi boss Jose Mourinho has admitted that the versatile forward has asked to leave the club, but they have not yet received an acceptable offer for him this transfer window. 90min reported last week that Tottenham and Roma were in talks over a potential    30m deal, though were struggling to agree on a structure. Spurs want an initial loan with an optional purchase clause and only an obligatory one if they qualify for the Champions League, while Roma want the clause to be obligatory regardless. Tottenham have now been joined in the race for Zaniolo by Serie A champions Milan, who they will face in the last 16 of the Champions League in February and March. Technical director Paolo Maldini is believed to be a fan of the Italy international. Milan have offered to take the 23-year-old on loan, but they crucially are willing to add Roma's desired obligation to buy him at the end of the season. They have so far offered a fee of    25m, which is below their asking price. Zaniolo has struggled to hit his previous heights for Roma this season. He scored the winner in last year's Europa Conference League final, but has failed to kick on this term.
