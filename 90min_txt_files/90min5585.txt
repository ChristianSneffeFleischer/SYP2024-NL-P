Exclusive: Udinese have told Leeds United that they will only accept an offer of  £40m for midfield star Rodrigo De Paul.  The Whites are keen to bolster their midfield options this summer, having been linked with the likes of Rangers' Ryan Kent and West Ham playmaker Manuel Lanzini. Marcelo Bielsa's side have since been tipped to sign Argentine De Paul, but his current club is reluctant to lose their talisman.  90min understands that the 26-year-old is the leading target for Leeds in this summer's transfer market, with director of football Victor Orta leading the chase for the midfielder - but the two clubs are still very far from reaching any kind of deal.  The main sticking point is the transfer fee. The newly-promoted Premier League side are prepared to stump up  £25m for De Paul, but that figure is a long way off the staggering  £40m that Udinese owner Giampaolo Pozzo is demanding.  Leeds are hopeful that Watford star Roberto Pereyra's switch to Udine will be the catalyst for De Paul's departure, but Pozzo insists that the two transfer deals are not connected.  Udinese will face a serious challenge in convincing their midfielder to remain in Serie A for the coming season, as he has his heart set on joining Bielsa at Elland Road. However, time is running out for this deal to come off, and the Whites are not afraid to pursue other options, should they give up on their dream of landing De Paul.
