Manchester United have confirmed that they have reached an agreement to sign French centre-back Raphael Varane from Real Madrid. United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has been looking for a new partner for Harry Maguire for a while now, and although his initial focus was on Sevilla's Jules Kounde and Villarreal's Pau Torres, he switched his attention to Varane when it became clear he wanted out of Real. Real had been reluctant to sell Varane, but with one year remaining on his contract, they were left with no choice but to sell and United quickly made it clear that they were ready to take advantage of the situation. ???????, ???? ?We have agreed a deal in principle for the transfer of @RaphaelVarane to United! ?            #MUFC Personal terms were not an issue for United, who have now taken to their official website to confirm that they have reached a deal with Real to land the World Cup winner. In a short statement, the club said: "Manchester United is delighted to announce the club has reached agreement with Real Madrid for the transfer of French international defender and World Cup winner, Rapha  l Varane, subject to a medical and to player terms being finalised." There is no mention of the fee paid for Varane. Real had initially been looking for close to  £70m, but United made it clear they would not be paying that sort of money and are instead thought to have closed the deal at around the  £45m mark. Varane becomes United's third signing of the summer, following the  £72.9m acquisition of winger Jadon Sancho from Borussia Dortmund and the deal to bring Tom Heaton in on a free transfer. United are not slowing down in the transfer market just yet. Talks are also underway to sign right-back Kieran Trippier from Atletico Madrid, while there are plans to sign a new midfielder as well.
