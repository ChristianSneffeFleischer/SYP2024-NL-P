Brazilian starlet Endrick continues to make history as he celebrated his first senior goal for Palmeiras, netting in front of suitors Real Madrid, 90min understands. Real Madrid were in attendance to witness the 16-year-old's debut against Cortiba at the start of the month, and Los Blancos were again represented to see his first goal. After coming on at half-time of their game at Athletico Paranaense, Endrick created one and then headed home his first-goal as he inspired a 3-1 success. Already the youngest ever player to feature for Palmeiras, he is now their youngest goalscorer and he is very much the talk of Brazilian football. "My first goals in the main team of Palmeiras, I dedicate to my family, who are my inspiration, my education and my protection. I hope to repay the affection of the people of Palmeiras, and of all Brazilians who also support me," Endrick stated after the game. "I hope to continue turning my dreams into goals and achievements. Heartfelt thanks for all the love!" Scott Saunders  hosts  Graeme Bailey  and  Toby Cudworth  in the latest episode of Talking Transfers. The team discuss Cristiano Ronaldo's Man Utd future, interest in Naby Keita and a decision looming for Harry Kane. Available on  all audio platforms.
