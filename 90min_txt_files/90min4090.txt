Conor Gallagher has emerged as a target for Leeds with Chelsea keen to ship the youngster out on loan again this season. The England Under-21 international secured a temporary switch to West Brom last season - going on to make 30 Premier League appearances including 28 starts for the Baggies - a move which represented his fourth loan in just two years. The Blues are unwilling to sanction a permanent move away from Stamford Bridge for Gallagher and are also keen to tie him down to a new long-term deal in the coming weeks, though with another loan move looking likely The Athletic report that Leeds have lodged their interest in the midfielder. It's not the first time Marcelo Bielsa has kept tabs on a Chelsea youngster this summer, with the Whites recently announcing the signing of talented Blues academy member Lewis Bate. Despite having already made contact with Chelsea over a move for Gallagher, a deal is far from done with Crystal Palace also hoping to secure the midfielder's services. As Bielsa continues to pursue a deal for Gallagher, one player who's edging closer to a move to Elland Road this summer is Kristoffer Klaesson. Leeds have been in contact with Norwegian outfit Valerenga for the past fortnight and The Athletic report a deal isn't far away and that the goalkeeper will fly to England to complete a medical next week.
