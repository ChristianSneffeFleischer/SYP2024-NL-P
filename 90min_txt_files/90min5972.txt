James Maddison will follow Leicester team-mate Nampalys Mendy in signing new terms at the King Power Stadium, with an announcement expected imminently on a new long-term contract. Maddison has been a revelation since arriving in the Midlands in 2018, catching the eye under Brendan Rodgers with his creativity and flair. He earned his first England cap in November and has been linked to the Premier League's top teams. Leicester have already had to contend with interest from both Manchester clubs, among others.  James Maddison. Happy at Leicester. Move on. pic.twitter.com/IBpsmNOqxD He is set to become that little bit harder to attain, however. The Telegraph claim that an announcement over a new contract will be made on Monday, after Maddison agreed lucrative new terms that will keep him tied to the club until 2024. Maddison missed the end of the 2019/20 campaign due to a hip injury, coinciding with a dip in form that saw Leicester miss out on Champions League qualification. The news on Maddison comes after the Foxes announced a new contract for another midfielder - 28-year-old Nampalys Mendy. #lcfc can confirm that midfielder @Papy_Mendy has signed a contract extension to the end of the 2021/22 season ?? Mendy managed just one minute of football in the first half of the season, but has been a regular in the squad since lockdown, starting against Brighton and making an appearance from the bench against Spurs. His deal had been due to expire this summer, but to the delight of manager Rodgers, the club have announced that he will stay until 2022.
