Chelsea have been linked with a new name in their search a left-sided defender to cover for long-term injury absentee Ben Chilwell: Stuttgart's Borna Sosa. England international Chilwell has been ruled out for the rest of the season having undergone surgery on his damaged anterior cruciate ligament at the end of 2021. As a result, Chelsea's priority in January has been to find left-back cover for stand-in Marcos Alonso - but their search has so far proved fruitless. Loan target Lucas Digne joined Aston Villa on a permanent basis, while Lyon have not allowed Emerson Palmieri to return to Stamford Bridge from his temporary spell in France. Versatile Brazilian Kenedy has been successfully recalled from his loan at Flamengo, but it remains unclear how head coach Thomas Tuchel intends to use him. According to Sky Germany, Stuttgart's Croatia international Sosa is the latest name to move across the Blues' radar. The attacking full-back has impressed this season despite his side's struggles, scoring twice and laying on four assists - including three in one game against Greuther Furth. However, a January move is unlikely. Stuttgart do not want to sell one their standout performers while they are embroiled in a relegation battle, and the 24-year-old is valued at    30m with a contract until 2025. Scudetto holders Inter are touted as another potential destination for Sosa, with the Nerazzurri searching for an offensive left-back to fit their five-at-the-back system. Chelsea's Premier League rivals Villa had made an attempt to sign the player but the deal fell through and they pipped for Digne instead.
