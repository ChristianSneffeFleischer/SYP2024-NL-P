Japhet Tanganga's Tottenham future is in doubt as talks over a long term contract for the defender have stalled.  The 21-year-old's breakthrough into the first team has been one of the most uplifting stories of Spurs' season. The England Under-20 international was thrown in at the deep end back in January, making his debut against Liverpool. The youngster excelled in that game and went on to make 13 appearances in total.  Tanganga was handed a one-year contract extension earlier this year but there is now doubts over whether he will stay past its 2021 expiration date. According to the Athletic, Spurs are keen to tie him down to a long term deal but the two parties are same way part on wage demands.  Tanganga currently earns just  £1,000 per week, and the club have offered to raise this to  £15,000. However, the youth academy graduate wants an even higher wage befitting of someone with Premier League and European experience.   Tanganga is happy at the club and has enjoyed working with Jos   Mourinho. Tottenham are keen to extend his stay in north London and there is confidence that a compromise can be reached in the future.  The news comes after it was revealed recently that fellow Spurs youngster Oliver Skipp - whose previous contract also expired next summer - has penned terms at the club until 2024.
