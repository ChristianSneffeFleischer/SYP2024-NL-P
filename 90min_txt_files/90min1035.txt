Several top clubs across Europe believe that Tottenham Hotspur will not sell Harry Kane this summer, sources have told 90min. Kane has one year left to run on his contract at Spurs and is set for talks with the club's hierarchy over his future following the conclusion of the 2022/23 season. Tottenham were full of optimism heading into the campaign but it ended in major disappointment, slumping to an eighth-place finish in the Premier League - their lowest since 2008/09 - and they were eliminated in the early rounds of three cup competitions. One of Spurs' only players not to underperform this year was Kane, who willed his way to 30 Premier League goals - his joint-highest tally - and became both Tottenham and England's all-time record scorers. 90min has previously reported that Bayern Munich, Manchester United and PSG would be interested in signing Kane, while Real Madrid could also make a move should they part ways with Karim Benzema this summer. Tottenham are also braced for Chelsea to enter the sweepstakes following the appointment of Mauricio Pochettino as head coach.

Though the striker has only one year left to run on his contract, the belief is Tottenham would demand over  Â£100m for him. However, chairman Daniel Levy is not putting a price tag on Kane as he is not currently willing to sanction an exit. Should Kane stay at Tottenham for another year, he would be able to leave on a free transfer in the summer of 2024 if he does not agree terms on a new deal. Many of Europe's top clubs are in the market for a striker this upcoming window, with Napoli's Victor Osimhen and Juventus' Dusan Vlahovic a target for various sides. LISTEN NOW
