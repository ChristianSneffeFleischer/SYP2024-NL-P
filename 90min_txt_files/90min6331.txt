Tomas Soucek is aiming to help guide West Ham to Premier League survival in order to extend his stay in east London beyond his loan spell. The midfielder joined the Hammers from Slavia Prague in January 2020, and his move will become permanent should West Ham remain in the Premier League. David Moyes' side secured a vital victory over Norwich in their most recent outing to leave them three points above the drop zone with three games left to play. Speaking to the Evening Standard, Soucek said: "I am enjoying the Premier League  because we play against big teams and I   m enjoying every day on the training ground.    I   m playing with guys that I   ve played with for four or five months but I   m really enjoying it and, hopefully, we   ll be safe and I will be able to enjoy more years here.    The 25-year-old will join West Ham in a  Â£16.5m deal this summer if the Hammers are still playing Premier League football next season. Soucek has caught the eye during his short spell at the London Stadium, making 10 Premier League appearances and chipping in with two goals. He turned in a particularly impressive display during West Ham's Michael Antonio-inspired 4-0 victory over Norwich on Saturday, as the Hammers took a huge step towards safety. Victory for fellow strugglers Watford, Bournemouth and Aston Villa means West Ham are still very much in danger of suffering the drop, but their destiny is in their hands heading into the final three games of the season. West Ham's remaining fixture's are particularly intriguing. The Hammers face Watford on Friday, the side sitting one place below them in the table.
