The 19-year-old broke into the first team during the 2019/2020 campaign, making 36 appearances and laying on six assists from right-back.  The United States international will soon become Bar  a's fifth signing of the current transfer window with Koeman confirming he was undertaking his medical during a press conference on Wednesday.     Sergi  o Dest is undergoing a medical examination. It is important to have young players for the future of this club," he said (via Ronan Murphy).  Dest has been recruited as a direct replacement to Nelson Semedo, who recently joined Wolves for around  Â£27m - adding to Nuno Espirito Santo's already sizable contingent of Portuguese players. Dest's signing represents a triumph of Barcelona's pulling power, after enduring a difficult summer.

However, there was plenty more controversy that followed. Luis Suarez entered a war of words with the Bar  a hierarchy before moving to La Liga rivals Atletico Madrid, while a fan group also started a petition to get president Josep Maria Bartomeu ousted from his role.
