Inter goalkeeper Andre Onana has revealed that while he would like to stay at the club beyond the summer, he could be forced out during the transfer window. Onana has been one of the Nerazzurri's star performers since his move from Ajax last summer, and he lived up to the hype during Saturday's Champions League final defeat to Manchester City. However, the Cameroonian could leave San Siro after only one season. 90min first reported in February that Inter's financial woes mean that they may have to raise funds through player sales, with Onana one of their key assets that could return a large fee. Chelsea particularly are interested in Onana, while Tottenham have also been keeping a close eye on his situation, though it's believed they may prioritise a move for Brentford's David Raya.

"I'm so, so happy at Inter," Onana said. "At this professional level you never know what happens. "I'm available for Inter, they decide and I will accept what they want. I'm happy at Inter." Following Saturday's final, Man City boss Pep Guardiola reserved special praise for Onana. "When you have a goalkeeper like Onana who can read perfectly where everyone is to pass to, with [Hakan] Calhanoglu and [Nicolo] Barella, then the strikers hold it up and move the ball around. It is very, very difficult. It would be a tiny bit easier without this goalkeeper, but still very tough," Guardiola said in his post-match press conference. LISTEN NOW
