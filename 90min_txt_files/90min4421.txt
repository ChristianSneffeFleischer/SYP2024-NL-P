Leicester City midfielder Youri Tielemans is    close    to signing a new long-term contract with the club following his match-winning performance in the FA Cup final against Chelsea. Tielemans scored one of the best goals in FA Cup final history to seal Leicester   s first-ever FA Cup trophy over the weekend, capping off another fine season for the Belgium international. 90min first revealed last October that Leicester are keen to agree and new and improved deal with Tielemans, who at that time had already been the subject of discreet enquiries from Paris Saint-Germain, Juventus and Inter checking on any potential availability. Fast forward six months and the Daily Telegraph now writes a new deal is almost complete, with talks having been ongoing for the past few weeks. Tielemans only has two more years left on his current contract until 2023, which means now is a good time time for Leicester to arrange fresh terms in order to keep him long-term. As 90min explained back in October, the 24-year-old is happy at Leicester and is grateful to the club for giving him the chance to kick-start his career following a disappointing spell with Monaco. A post shared by 90min (@90min_football) Since arriving in January 2019, initially on loan prior to a  Â£40m permanent transfer, Tielemans has also been impressed with the direction that Leicester have been heading in and was happy to see ambitious recruitment last summer with the arrival of Wesley Fofana. Tielemans has an ambition of playing Champions League football again, having previously played in the competition with both Anderlecht and Monaco, but has long believed Leicester are fully capable of helping him make that dream a reality. Third in the Premier League table with two games left to play, Leicester will return to the Champions League next season if they can hold their nerve in the final fixtures.
