Chelsea are confident that they have won the race to sign Michael Olise from Crystal Palace, 90min understands.  90min recently reported that Olise had attracted interest from Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester City during the summer transfer window following an eye-catching 2022/23 campaign with Palace. Last season, Olise became the first Palace player ever to record more than 10 Premier League assists in a single season as he led the south London club to safety alongside fellow young talent Eberechi Eze.  Despite the interest from the Premier League's top two of last season, sources have now confirmed that Chelsea believe they have won the race for Olise's signature. Olise's younger brother, Richard, is also currently on the books and the Blues' strong relationship with the family has helped with the Blues' bid to sign the talented France Under-21 international.  feed Due to a 'mechanism' in his Crystal Palace contract, Olise is available for just  £35m this summer - a small fee for a talented youngster with proven Premier League experience.  Palace have already moved to try and replace Olise, as well as Wilfried Zaha who left as a free agent to join Galatasaray, as 90min understands that the club are close to sealing a deal to sign Brazilian youngster Matheus Franca.  The south Londoners are set to pay an initial  £17m plus  £8.5m in add-ons in order to sign the young attacking midfielder. Key to negotiations over Franca has been Palace's co-owner John Textor's connections in Brazil, with Textor also being a co-owner of Brazilian club Botafogo.
