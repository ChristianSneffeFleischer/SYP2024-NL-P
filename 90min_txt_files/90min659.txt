Tottenham Hotspur have confirmed the signing of goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario from Empoli. Spurs made signing a new goalkeeper one of their top priorities for the summer transfer window and have moved quickly to bring in Vicario after a move for Brentford's David Raya stalled. Personal terms had been agreed with Raya but Spurs were unable to find an agreement with Brentford over their  Â£40m asking price. Attention then shifted to Vicario, who was a target for Serie A sides Inter, Juventus and Roma, while Brighton and Manchester United also watched him during the 2022/23 season. Tottenham confirmed on Tuesday that Vicario's transfer is now complete, signing a five-year contract. feed "We are delighted to announce the signing of Guglielmo Vicario from Empoli, subject to international clearance and a work permit," Spurs said in a statement. "The Italy international has signed a contract with the Club that will run until 2028 and will wear the number 13 shirt." Vicario becomes Spurs' second signing of the summer, following on from the permanent transfer of Dejan Kulusevski from Juventus, and is expected to take over from Hugo Lloris in goal. The Frenchman has one year remaining on his contract in north London but outlined his intention to seek a new challenge. 90min understands Tottenham are progressing in talks to sign James Maddison from Leicester, with new head coach Ange Postecoglou keen to bring in the England international.
