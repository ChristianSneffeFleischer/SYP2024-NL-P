Chelsea have clinched the signing of 17-year-old Jamaica international Dujuan Richards, pipping Newcastle to his signature. The teenager, who made his debut for his country against Trinidad & Tobago last week, agreed terms and signed for Chelsea before his international bow. Richards arrives from the Phoenix Academy and will join up with Chelsea in November when he turns 18. He had spent two weeks on trial with Newcastle before opting for a move to west London. The forward confirmed the deal on his social media, saying: "What a dream come true. When I am 18-years-old I will be able to play in the Premier League and for a club like Chelsea."  manual He made the same decision as Brazilian starlet Andrey Santos, who also opted for a move to Chelsea despite strong interest from Newcastle.    Whenever you manage a player, it is important that you look at all available options and choose the best possible offer," his agent Craig Butler told The Jamaica Gleaner.    Newcastle really did a great job and made a big effort to get him and we appreciate everything that they have done. Newcastle presented a very good offer and so did Genk and Ajax. But for us Chelsea presented the best one.    Chelsea were not just better from a financial perspective but also in terms of his football pathway and the plan for the player."
