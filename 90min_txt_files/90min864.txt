Agent Jorge Mendes has revealed that Ansu Fati wants to stay at Barcelona, while he provided a cryptic update on the future of Wolves midfielder Ruben Neves. Fati has proven to be one of Bar  a's most successful graduates from their La Masia academy system in recent years. He has already scored 29 goals in 109 games for the club and doesn't even turn 21 until October. However, reports in recent months have claimed that La Blaugrana could sell Fati in order to raise funds for incoming transfers. 90min reported in May that Barcelona told the winger he could leave the club, with Mendes attempting to broker a swap deal that would send Neves to Camp Nou and Fati to Molineux. But Fati has so far resisted attempts to leave Barcelona, with Mendes confirming this in a recent interview. "Ansu wants to stay, he wants to stay," Mendes insisted to Jijantes. When pushed for an answer on whether that means Fati will stay, Mendes replied: "He has scored three goals in his last two games, what more do you want? "I am convinced that he is one of the best youngsters in the world, and that he will win a Ballon d   Or."
