Inter Miami have confirmed the signing of free agent Sergio Busquets following the expiration of his contract at Barcelona.  Busquets spent 15 seasons in Barca's first-team before leaving at the end of June, winning three UEFA Champions Leagues, seven Copa del Rey and nine La Liga titles - including one in his final year at the club - during a storied career with La Blaugrana.  The defensive midfielder has now joined up with his former Barca teammate Lionel Messi in Miami and will occupy one of the club's Designated Player roster spots.  feed Speaking after making the move to the club's official website, Busquets said:    This is a special and exciting opportunity that I   m very excited to take. I   m looking forward to this next step in my career with Inter Miami. "I was impressed by the Club when I came with Barcelona last year and now I   m happy and ready to represent the Club myself. I can   t wait to help bring the success that this ambitious Club strives for.
