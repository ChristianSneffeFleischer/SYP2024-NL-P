Benfica have begun working on a deal to sign Sergio Aguero, who will leave Manchester City at the end of the season. City announced on Monday that Aguero would depart after ten years upon the expiry of his contract in the summer, immediately prompting interest from all angles. It's going to be emotional... ?? #ManCity | https://t.co/axa0klD5rehttps://t.co/4COpSpmz7a Barcelona have already been linked with a move for the Argentine, but Portuguese outlet Record report that Benfica are 'trying' to sign Aguero and got to work on the move as soon as the announcement about his exit was made. They claim that the club has already made contact with Aguero and are even speaking to his Portuguese City teammates in Joao Cancelo and Ruben Dias to convince the 32-year-old to move to the club ahead of next season. Benfica are also ready to call on fellow Argentines and Benfica alumni Pablo Aimar and Javier Saviola if needed. As Aguias would be prepared to offer Aguero a three-year deal that would see him earn    12m. Aguero isn't the first high-profile veteran striker who has been linked with a move to Benfica, who are keen to start next season with an international star among the ranks, according to the report.
