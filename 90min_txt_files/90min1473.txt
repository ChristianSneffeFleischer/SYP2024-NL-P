Bayern Munich are still set to push ahead with an offer to sign Harry Kane this summer despite tying Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting down to a new deal, 90min understands. The in-form Cameroonian, who has already scored 15 goals in 24 games for the German champions this season, signed a one-year extension on Friday with his previous deal expiring in the summer. Choupo-Moting's redemption has been one of the surprise stories of the Bundesliga season, stepping up to provide goals following the departure of Robert Lewandowski and an injury-hit campaign for summer signing Sadio Mane. Nevertheless, sources have told 90min that Bayern's ideal plan for the 2023/24 season is to have both Choupo-Moting and transfer target Kane on their books. READ NEXT manual Bayern first made their interest in Kane public last summer and their various directors have admitted their admiration of the Tottenham striker since, though have tried to play down a potential move by claiming his price tag would be too high. 90min previously revealed Bayern value Kane at around    50m - the same fee they sold Lewandowski to Barcelona for. However, they recognise Spurs would ask for a higher fee considering he is five years the Pole's junior. Kane's contract at Spurs expires in 2024, and if a new one isn't signed by the summer, Bayern intend to push ahead with a move for him. Meanwhile, Chelsea forward Kai Havertz is also of interest to Bayern, though he is earmarked as a long-term replacement to Thomas Muller rather than a potential centre forward option. WATCH NOW
