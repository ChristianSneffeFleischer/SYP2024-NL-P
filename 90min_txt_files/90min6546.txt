Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola is said to have been in touch with Bayer Leverkusen's Leon Bailey in order to present the club's vision to the player - but the Sky Blues will face competition for his signature. Bailey has long been tipped for a bright future but has started just ten league games for Leverkusen in 2019/20. Bailey, who can operate on either flank, has managed five goals and three assists in the Bundesliga in total this season. With Manchester City's Leroy Sane set on a move away from the club, it has been said that City have identified Bailey as a potential replacement for the German. Guardiola recently confirmed that Sane has turned down new contract offers from the club as he looks to seal a move to Bayern Munich.  Foot Mercato now report that Guardiola has already been in touch with Leverkusen's Bailey in order to lay out the club's vision and project. It is further said that there is a 'mutual interest' in a potential transfer, with the 22-year-old 'very interested' in the idea of working under Guardiola.
