Chelsea are close to striking a deal with Inter to sign young midfielder Cesare Casadei, 90min understands. Blues owner Todd Boehly has made a point of working to recruit a number of youngsters this summer, such as 18-year-old midfielder Carney Chukwuemeka from Aston Villa for around  Â£20m. Chukwuemeka was one of the stars of the European Under-19 Championships earlier this summer and Chelsea are now close to adding another of the tournament's top performers in Casadei, whose Italy side fell to England in the semi-final. Chelsea have had a number of bids rejected for the 19-year-old but sources have now confirmed to 90min that they are preparing to lodge an offer which will meet Inter's asking price of around    15m. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  &  Sean Walsh  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Man Utd's transfer market implosion in targeting deals for Adrien Rabiot & Marko Arnautovic, Man City's stance on selling Bernardo Silva to Barcelona, Wilfried Zaha's future and more.
