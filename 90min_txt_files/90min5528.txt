Newcastle are understood to have entered the race to sign Juventus defender Daniele Rugani as Steve Bruce looks to bolster his defensive options before the close of the transfer window. The Old Lady are embarking on a period of transition as they look to offload a number of their high earners from the payroll. Gonzalo Higuain and Blaise Matuidi have already headed for David Beckham   s Inter Miami this summer and it seems the departures may be set to continue, with Rugani also deemed surplus to requirements. Italian journalist Alfredo Pedulla claims that Newcastle have shown    concrete interest    in the 26-year-old and that an offer could be made    between tonight and tomorrow   . Newcastle are understood to be keen to secure a loan deal for Rugani with a permanent move to follow, although there is no word as yet on whether Juve would be open to an initial temporary move with the club keen to raise funds. The Magpies are just the latest club to have shown an interest in the Italian defender after La Liga outfit Valencia offered to take Rugani on loan, though the bid was rejected by the Serie A champions. I Bianconeri had high hopes for Rugani after snapping him up as a teenager from fellow Italian side Empoli. However, the 26-year-old has failed to develop as they would have hoped and it seems the Juve hierarchy   s patience has finally run out.
