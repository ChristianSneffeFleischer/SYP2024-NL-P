Exclusive - Tottenham are considering an approach for Braga striker Paulinho, as Jos   Mourinho seeks to ease the load on Harry Kane by recruiting an established alternative to the England captain.  Mourinho has been open about his desire to add a new forward to the squad this summer, having been forced to use Son Heung-min, Steven Bergwijn, Lucas Moura and even Dele Alli up front at times last season in the prolific striker's absence. On Friday, the Portuguese boss addressed a lack of 'balance' to his options at the top end of the pitch, admitting that the club 'want and need' a new number nine.

Mourinho is well aware of the 27-year-old, who brings European experience and a proven goalscoring record. He has hit double figures in each of his last four seasons for the Portuguese side, and was a particular standout in 2019/20 when he scored 25 times in 48 appearances.  He would be available for less than  £30m, and Spurs are considering stepping up their interest, having decided against formal bids for Ollie Watkins and Callum Wilson, who have each now moved elsewhere.
