West Ham manager David Moyes admits he may not bring a recognised striker to the London Stadium before the end of the transfer window. The Hammers are largely reliant on Michail Antonio - who has started the season in sensational fashion - staying fit, though his workload and troublesome hamstrings are likely to be tested by a punishing schedule that now includes Europa League football and potential international football with Jamaica. Andriy Yarmolenko and Jarrod Bowen, along with other players to a lesser extent, are capable of playing through the middle if required, but West Ham have long been linked with bringing another striker in to support Antonio. However, with the transfer deadline fast approaching, Moyes concedes that he may not be able to sign a striker, despite being keen to do so.  Here's what he told the press ahead of the weekend clash with Crystal Palace. "There's a really good chance we don't sign a centre forward, really good chance we don't get one. "That's a fact and I've been saying that all along, you know the quality of centre forward that's required to come in so there's a good chance we don't get one. We've brought Said in to get us goals, we've got Jarrod Bowen to get us goals.  "They're not out-and-out number nines so we may look to see if we can do that as well from other areas." "I am really desperate to sign one, I want to find another one. But from what we can get and what we've been offered that's available, at the moment I'm not quite getting it - either the cost is too much or they're not available. "We'd like to do that and hope that we can find somebody, but I've certainly not got any guarantees that's for sure."
