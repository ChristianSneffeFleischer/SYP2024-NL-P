Arsenal midfielder Albert Sambi Lokonga has insisted his absence from pre-season training is down to a 'small injury'. The Gunners have jetted off to Germany to begin their preparations for the new season but have travelled without Sambi Lokonga, with many fans assuming the Belgian's absence was due to the uncertainty surrounding his future. The 23-year-old, who spent the second half of last season on loan with Crystal Palace, has been linked with another move away this summer. But regardless of whether a move materialises or not, Sambi Lokonga insisted his absence from training was purely down to fitness. "Due to a small muscular injury, I'll sadly not be part of the summer camp with the team in Germany," he wrote on Instagram. "I'm focused now on my recovery to prepare the season and be ready to help the team at my fullest capacity." feed One midfielder who is expected to join with Arsenal imminently is England Under-21 star Emile Smith Rowe. After helping the Young Lions towards glory at this summer's European Championships, Smith Rowe is expected to take just a week off and football.london state that the academy graduate will link up with Arsenal in the United States at the end of this week. The 22-year-old has put in plenty of extra work this summer, including a trip to Dubai immediately after the conclusion of the Premier League season to work on his fitness, with a view to earning a greater role in the Arsenal squad. Injuries and competition for minutes saw Smith Rowe forced to accept just 12 Premier League appearances last season, none of which came as a starter.
