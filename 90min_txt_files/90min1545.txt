Manchester City scouts have been impressed by Inter's Federico Dimarco during their search for a new left-back, 90min understands. The Italian international has been one of Inter's standout performers during the 2022/23 season, keeping Robin Gosens out of I Nerazzurri's starting XI due to his outstanding form.  Known for his ability to delivery deadly crosses into the box and drop into central midfield positions when needed, it's clear why City would be interested in Dimarco and sources have confirmed to 90min that scouts have been thoroughly impressed. Joao Cancelo is expected to leave the club on a permanent deal at the end of his loan move to Bayern Munich. The Bundesliga side are looking to negotiate a reduction from their    70m option to buy, but other sides are also keen. Indeed, both Chelsea and Real Madrid have expressed an interest although Cancelo's current preference would be to remain in Munich.
