Exclusive - Manchester City have told Tosin Adarabioyo  that he could push for a first-team place next season, if he agrees to sign a new contract. The Premier League runners-up have been impressed with how the 22-year-old has performed while on loan at Blackburn Rovers this season where he has made 35 appearances and scored three goals. He similarly caught the eye during a stint at West Bromwich Albion during the 2018/2019 campaign. The former England Under-19 international was a mainstay in a Baggies team that were narrowly defeated by Aston Villa on penalties in the Championship playoff semi final.  A source has confirmed to 90min that a host of Premier League sides are interested in the burgeoning centre-back with several clubs already making enquiries to City about his availability.  Adarabioyo has just 12-months left on his current deal and the Citizens are keen for him to sign a new long term contract. However, if he does pen terms it is unlikely that he will spend next season out on loan. The club believe that he could become a useful squad member for Pep Guardiola, in an area of the team that lacks depth.  City have struggled defensively this season with an injury to Aymeric Laporte leaving them desperately short of options at the back. John Stones and Nicolas Otamendi have been criticised for their performances with 35-year-old Fernandinho shoehorned into the position in their stead.
