Tottenham's attempts to sign Nicolo Zaniolo from Roma are at risk of being thwarted by former boss Jose Mourinho, 90min understands. 90min revealed earlier this week that Spurs' bid to take the 23-year-old on loan with a purchase clause for an initial    25m was knocked back by the Giallorossi, who were not happy with such a low offer being tabled. Fabio Paratici, Tottenham's managing director of football, is still in talks with the Serie A side, but sources have told 90min that Mourinho is keen to ensure Zaniolo remains at the Stadio Olimpico. Roma remain open to selling Zaniolo if their    50m asking price is met, but chances of him leaving on a loan with an obligation to buy are waning and they would now prefer a straight-cash deal. Should Zaniolo be at Roma come September's deadline, then the club will open talks over a new contract. However, there is an understanding that any deal will not be as lucrative as those offered by Tottenham or Serie A rivals Juventus, who also retain an interest. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  &  Sean Walsh  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Man Utd's transfer market implosion in targeting deals for Adrien Rabiot & Marko Arnautovic, Man City's stance on selling Bernardo Silva to Barcelona, Wilfried Zaha's future and more.
