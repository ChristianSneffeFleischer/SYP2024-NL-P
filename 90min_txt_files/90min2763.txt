Nottingham Forest have confirmed the signings of Emmanuel Dennis from Watford and free agent Cheikhou Kouyate. 24-year-old Dennis scored 10 Premier League goals for the Hornets last season, but was unable to help the club avoid relegation back to the Championship. The Nigerian, who has seven international caps to his name, was eyed by a number of Premier League clubs, but joins big-spending Forest in a move worth around  Â£20m. He has penned a four-year deal at the City Ground and will pair up with international teammate Taiwo Awoniyi - who had earlier in the window become the club's record signing when he arrived from Union Berlin. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  &  Sean Walsh  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Man Utd's transfer market implosion in targeting deals for Adrien Rabiot & Marko Arnautovic, Man City's stance on selling Bernardo Silva to Barcelona, Wilfried Zaha's future and more. Available on  all audio platforms  and the  90min YouTube channel. If you can't see the podcast embed, click  here  to download the episode in full!
