Cristiano Ronaldo will not be signing for Marseille this summer, according to the club's president Pablo Longoria. The Portuguese forward has been looking to leave Manchester United after they failed to qualify for this season's Champions League. He has been linked with moves all over Europe, with Thomas Tuchel cooling Chelsea's interest in the 37-year-old behind the scenes and the likes of Atletico Madrid and Bayern Munich publicly distancing themselves from such a transfer. Ronaldo has been linked with a move to Ligue 1 side Marseille - the bitter rivals of Lionel Messi's PSG - in the last week, but Longoria insists he will not be making the move to Stade Veledrome this summer. "It   s the social media world full of fake news. We want reality. Ronaldo deal is not for us," Longoria said. "It   d be like saying that De Bruyne or Haaland are OM targets. Let   s focus on our real project." Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey,  Toby Cudworth  and  Harry Symeou  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Antony attempting to push through a move to Man Utd, Frenkie de Jong and Pierre-Emerick Aubayemang's futures at Barcelona and Arsenal's interest in Pedro Neto.
