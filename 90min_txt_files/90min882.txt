Kylian Mbappe has told Paris Saint-Germain he does not intend to sign a new contract or stay at the club beyond 2024, opening the possibility of a summer transfer. Mbappe has attracted heavy interest from Real Madrid over the past few years, but first turned them down in 2022 when he signed a new contract at Parc des Princes. PSG retained the Ligue 1 title but are facing a summer of change with Lionel Messi departing after two seasons and Neymar also courting interest after another injury-plagued campaign. Mbappe was again consistent for the French giants but Champions League glory evaded them in a last 16 exit to Bayern Munich and Mbappe's decision now places further pressure on PSG.  90min understands the club are shocked by Mbappe's decision, which will force them to either sell this summer or let the World Cup winner walk for free in a year. feed The extra year is a mutual option, which means both sides need to agree for it to be exercised. Real Madrid are in the market for a new forward in the wake of Karim Benzema's move to Saudi Arabia. Los Blancos had previously earmarked Tottenham's Harry Kane as their top target and Florentino Perez was even captured on film saying Real would sign Mbappe at some point, "but not this year". Mbappe had said at the end of May he intended to stay at PSG and honour his contract, but his latest decision on his future will force Les Parisiens' hand. Real are already gearing up to announce the signing of England international Jude Bellingham, who recently passed a medical ahead of his initial    100m move from Borussia Dortmund.
