Barcelona have decided that they do not want to sign on-loan winger Yusuf Demir permanently and have warned him that he will not play for the club again. Demir is on a season-long loan from Rapid Vienna that comes with a    10m obligation to buy if he features in ten matches across all competitions. He currently sits at nine, and it was recently revealed that Demir would be benched until after the January transfer window as Barcelona do not want that    10m to come out of their January transfer budget - but the feeling was that the young winger still had a future at Camp Nou. Well, according to Marca, that's not the case. The belief now is that Barcelona do not want to sign Demir permanently at all as those in charge believe he has not improved as much as he should have done, and given their delicate financial situation, they do not want to take the risk on an unproven player. Barcelona have made it abundantly clear to Demir that he will not play another game for the club, and they have urged him to find a new home for the remainder of the season. It is expected that Demir will return to Rapid Vienna in the coming weeks and will join a new team on loan, although there is no mention of where he could end up.
