Chelsea have given Hakim Ziyech permission to explore an immediate move away from the club after a deadline day switch to Paris Saint-Germain broke down, 90min understands. A deal was agreed to take Ziyech to PSG on loan late on Tuesday, with the Morocco international in France waiting for the green light over a move which was ultimately not completed before the closure of the window. PSG are known to be 'absolutely furious' with Chelsea, accusing the Blues of making a number of inexcusable mistakes which delayed the completion of the transfer, while there have also been reports of technical issues inside the offices of France's Professional Football League (LFP). The French side appealed the decision but, with no paperwork signed before the deadline, failed to convince the LFP to allow the transfer, leaving Ziyech forced to return to Chelsea for the remainder of the season. Most of the transfer windows in Europe's major leagues are now closed, but sources have confirmed to 90min that Ziyech has been given permission to meet with interested clubs who could still take him for the remainder of the season. Ziyech has received interest in his services from both Turkey and the United Arab Emirates, but whether he would be interested in making such a move is unclear. Manager Graham Potter was asked about Ziyech in Thursday's press conference ahead of the Premier League meeting with Fulham, in which he stressed that he expects the 29-year-old to remain committed to Chelsea for the remainder of the season.
