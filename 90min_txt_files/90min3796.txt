Real Madrid want to hire Liverpool sporting director Michael Edwards at the end of the season to drive an overdue squad rebuild at the Bernabeu. Edwards, who initially joined Liverpool as head of performance analysis in 2011, held a string of key roles at Anfield over several years, before being promoted to sporting director in November 2016, just over 12 months into manager Jurgen Klopp   s reign. The executive has been widely credited for building the squad that saw Klopp deliver Champions League and Premier League titles and re-established the Reds as one of the best teams in the world. Not only has his ability as a recruiter been praised, so has the way he often finds buyers willing to pay handsome transfer fees for surplus players at Liverpool. The Athletic initially reported in August that Edwards is expected to step down from his role at Anfield at the end of this season. He is coming to the end of his contract and is said to have informed the club of his intention to move on, although the situation has not been finalised. His decision isn   t believed to have been made as a result of influence from any other clubs, while Liverpool would be expected to promote assistant sporting director Julian Ward from within. Seemingly spying an opportunity, Real Madrid have now been linked with Edwards. The Sun writes that Los Blancos hade made the 41-year-old a target as they plan to overhaul the current setup. Real have an ageing squad, with Luka Modric, Karim Benzema, Toni Kroos, Marcelo, Eden Hazard, Gareth Bale, Lucas Vazquez and Nacho all in their thirties. Thibaut Courtois, Casemiro, Dani Carvajal and Isco will also all turn 30 before the end of this season.
