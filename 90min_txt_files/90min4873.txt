In a surprise to absolutely nobody, Mesut Ozil has left Arsenal to join Fenerbahce on a free transfer.  The former Germany international hadn't played for the Gunners since before the first lockdown back in March, and was left out of their squads for both the Premier League and Europa League this season. He began to tease a move away, and the hints were initially subtle...ish. I definitely will. There are two countries I want to play football in before I retire: Turkey ?? and USA ??. If I went to Turkey, I could only go to Fenerbahce. https://t.co/TL68kUL62M But they soon spiralled out of control until he basically confirmed it last week.  ? ????       pic.twitter.com/WfFg5m1stp ?    ?? ?? pic.twitter.com/tknCvzVHLH The lack of an official announcement had some scratching their heads, but on a Sunday afternoon of all times, it finally arrived. The saga is over.  Thank you, @MesutOzil1088        Mesut   zil is now ?????????? a Fenerbahce player! ? pic.twitter.com/wmK6NcPWal ? @MesutOzil1088's health check is done. @AcibademSaglik pic.twitter.com/EM9jZCL8iS Emotions were...conflicting. Ozil was quick out the blocks with a mammoth statement (read it all here) that had some fans in tears.  pic.twitter.com/waFIbx1fo9 Thank you, Gunners!        #YaGunnersYa pic.twitter.com/lkVI2qHC6X pic.twitter.com/0XOwFFmpE9 Some were quick to remember the good times, like singing his name in time to that Billy Ray Cyrus song, back when fans were allowed in stadiums and football was fun.  What a time to be alive. @MesutOzil1088        pic.twitter.com/iAfhJ3l1Os Thanks for the memories. One of the best to do it in the red & white        @MesutOzil1088 pic.twitter.com/QSwwUm3IZk Others pointed to his off-field behaviour, commending him for his conduct and the charity work that continues to paint him in a good light to this day.  We should all remember the amazing charitable things he did off the pitch & his stand against things outside football. His principles should be applauded.He had a personality & a sense of humour, something sadly lacking these days.That response to Piers Morgan - priceless Of course, there were those who took a more cynical outlook, and are just happy to see the back of their top earner at a time when finances are stretched to the limit.  People acting like Ozil paid their bills and put food on their tables pic.twitter.com/gLFExuTuU5 Arsenal's tweet confirming his departure raised an eyebrow or two and there have been suggestions the Gunners were a little insincere towards a player who made more than 250 appearances for the club. Ozil farewell                                   vs Giroud farewell pic.twitter.com/h6jk5agkxL It should be noted, granted, that the club did go into more detail in their statement, with 400 words or so from Edu and Mikel Arteta thanking him for his services. I mean, it beats Fenerbahce's announcement pic.twitter.com/pWJRsLvTKd Straight to the point.  Whatever your stance on Ozil's exit, though, there can be no denying he was a fine player at his best. His highlight reel stands him up there with some of the very best around - after 44 goals and 77 assists, how could it not?  When Mesut Ozil was on his game for #Arsenal, he was really on it...
