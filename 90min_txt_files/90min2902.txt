Tottenham are continuing talks with Roma over a move for Italy international Nicolo Zaniolo, 90min understands. Spurs have already made six signings this transfer window and are keen on bringing in further reinforcements ahead of their return to the Champions League this season. 90min has previously reported of their long-standing interest in Zaniolo, and despite Roma's hopes of keeping him and handing him a new contract later this year, Tottenham are continuing to push for a transfer - though it would likely take a fee of over    50m to sign him. Managing director of football Fabio Paratici has held further talks with the Giallorossi's general manager Tiago Pinto in recent days, while Zaniolo featured in Roma's 1-0 pre-season win over Spurs in Israel on Saturday. In that match, Antonio Conte played wing-backs Matt Doherty and Ivan Perisic extremely high up the pitch, and it's understood the Italian would plan on using Zaniolo in a similar fashion despite usually playing as a forward or playmaker. Juventus remain interested in Zaniolo having also held negotiations with Roma this summer, but Tottenham lead the chase with the 23-year-old open to moving to England.
