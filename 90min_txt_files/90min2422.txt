Tottenham winger Lucas Moura has spoken highly of Sevilla and his interest in playing in La Liga. Lucas, who played a starring role as Spurs reached the 2019 Champions League final, has entered the final two years of his contract in north London and was out of favour even before a calf injury that has ruled him out of action since August. The Brazilian only played 12 minutes across Spurs    first two Premier League games of the season, with no natural position for him in Antonio Conte   s preferred system and Dejan Kulusevski consistently getting the nod in support of Harry Kane and Son Heung-min. Lucas has previously admitted that he would be open to playing as a wing-back     Conte has previously had success converting attacking wide players     but that chance has not come his way. Now, when questioned about the possibility of joining Sevilla, the 30-year-old responded positively.    I didn   t know about Sevilla   s interest, but it   s a club that I like and a city that they speak very highly of,    Lucas is quoted as saying by VamosMiSevilla.    Playing in La Liga would be something fantastic for me, because I like it a lot.    90min previously revealed that Aston Villa were among several Premier League clubs to enquire about Lucas in the final stages of the summer transfer window. Lucas was a major target for Sir Alex Ferguson in his final months as Manchester United manager, but ended up being a bit-part rotation player under Jose Mourinho and never really established himself as a starter under Conte last season either.
