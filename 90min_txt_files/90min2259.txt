Frenkie de Jong has accused Barcelona of leaking his contract with the club in an attempt to pressure him into lowering his wages. The Dutchman was a top target for Manchester United during the summer and while Barcelona were always adamant they wanted to keep De Jong, those in charge at Camp Nou often went public to insist that he would not be able to stay unless he slashed his wages to aid their financial difficulties. In the end, a transfer never materialised and De Jong remains on the same wages, but he has admitted he was thoroughly unimpressed with how Barcelona handled the situation. "One day a paper published details from my contract," he told De Telegraaf. "I didn't leak it and only one other party knew about this, so it had to be the club who did this. Suddenly there was a letter in which the question was asked whether my contract was still valid because the previous president made the contract. "I found it very annoying that the club did this, but I had no further influence on things. I blame these people [those at Bar  a who wanted him out], but I have nothing to do with them. Yes, they are Barca for me because they lead the club. But I don't see them when I'm at the club. I have nothing to do with them in my daily life."
