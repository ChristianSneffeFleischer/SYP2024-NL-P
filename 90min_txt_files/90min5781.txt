Everton have finalised the transfer of James Rodriguez from Real Madrid on a two-year deal with option for a third, reuniting the attacker with manager Carlo Ancelotti. The duo spent time together at the Bernabeu when Rodriguez first moved to Spain before they again joined forces in Germany with Bayern Munich. The Colombia international performed well during his two-year loan stint with the Bundesliga giants, though no permanent deal materialised. He featured in just eight La Liga games for Real during the 2019/20 season and his move to Everton offers the 29-year-old the chance to kickstart his career. ?? | It's official... @jamesdrodriguez is a Blue! ?#Al  James pic.twitter.com/hNDsLvtqtT    I am really, really happy to be at this great club, a club with so much history, and here with a manager who knows me really well,    James is quoted as saying by the Toffees' website.     I   m looking forward to achieving great things here     and winning things, which is what everyone   s aim is.    I   ve come here to try to improve, to get better. I   ve also come here to help the team to win, to play good football     entertaining football.     I   m convinced, with Carlo and his technical staff, we can achieve big things and one of the big reasons [I signed] was the presence of Carlo Ancelotti.     I have enjoyed some great times with him previously at two different clubs. That was a massive reason to come here.    Real were thought to have been demanding    25m for the transfer, though it is unclear whether or not Everton have matched that figure. Rodriguez is Everton's second major signing of the window, following the arrival of Allan from Napoli. The deal itself shows the pull manager Ancelotti still possesses. Everton can offer no European football this season to new recruits, though continental qualification ought to be one of their aims for the upcoming season.
