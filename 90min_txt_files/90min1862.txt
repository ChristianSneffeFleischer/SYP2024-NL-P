Brighton will not be bullied into an enforced sale of forward Leandro Trossard, who has demanded a January exit after being banished from the first team squad. Josy Comhair, Trossard's agent, delivered a statement before the weekend urging the Seagulls to allow the Belgium international to leave this month, claiming he had been frozen out of the team by manager Roberto De Zerbi. Trossard's actions have angered the club, 90min understands, and an exit will only be granted if their demands are met by an asking team.

The club do not need to sell and on-pitch performances have yet to be affected by the off-field drama. Trossard has been dropped from the Seagulls squad and was out of the country when the south coast side steamrolled Liverpool 3-0 on Saturday afternoon.
