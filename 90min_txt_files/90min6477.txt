Juventus' chief football officer Fabio Paratici has warned off potential buyers for Adrien Rabiot this summer, insisting the Frenchman will stay in Turin. Rabiot has recently been linked with a move to the Premier League, with Arsenal and Manchester United said to be interested, following a pretty indifferent debut campaign at Juve after his summer move. The 25-year-old has made just 13 league starts under Maurizio Sarri this term, with the Bianconeri's midfield a constant source of their woes throughout the campaign. However, despite reports that the Juve hierarchy are already losing faith in Rabiot, Paratici has refuted claims that the club are looking to offload him at the end of the campaign. "Let   s not forget that Rabiot is in his first year in Italy, and the first year is always special," Paratici told Sky Sport Italia, via Metro. "At the start of the season, we could see the same doubts over Matthijs de Ligt, who happened to be the best defender in the Champions League [with Ajax last season] at the age of 19. Now I see there is a different opinion of him. "Rabiot also arrived from PSG after six months of inactivity. He had to catch up with his physical condition. "That said, he is a great player, someone who is very important for Juventus today and will be for the future."
