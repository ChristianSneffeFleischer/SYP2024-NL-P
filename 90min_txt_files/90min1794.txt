Borussia Dortmund have confirmed young striker Youssoufa Moukoko has signed a new contract which will run until 2026. The 18-year-old's previous deal was due to expire this summer and a number of interested clubs had been interested in a move this year. 90min understands Barcelona, Chelsea and Newcastle had all been tracking the situation but Moukoko has accepted Dortmund's contract offer after a long series of negotiations. Moukoko said: "It's no secret that I feel good at BVB.  I played in the youth teams, took my first steps in professional football here and now I'm ready to take the next step in my development together with the club. I feel the trust of the coaching staff and I have an environment here in which I can develop perfectly. "Of course I was honoured by the interest of other clubs, but ultimately it's a heart decision.  The fans have always supported me and I want to give something back to them and the club." Dortmund sporting director Sebastian Kehl added: "Youssoufa is an exceptional player who we trained ourselves and in whom we still see huge development potential.  So I'm happy that we were able to convince Youssoufa before the start of the second half of the season, which is so important for us, that he has the best prospects at BVB and that his path is far from over here.
