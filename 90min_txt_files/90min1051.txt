Mason Mount has praised Chelsea fans for their support over this past season as he heads for a 'break' over the summer. Having missed the end of Chelsea's season with a pelvic injury, there is a real possibility that Mount may have played his last game for the Blues as he approaches a summer transfer window in which he could be sold. Mount will enter the final year of his contract and has been warned he will be sold this summer if he does not agree an extension. All offers thus far have failed to tempt the midfielder but talks have not yet been ended, with incoming manager Mauricio Pochettino known to be keen to keep hold of Mount. After Sunday's 1-1 draw to close out the season at Stamford Bridge, Mount took part in the lap of appreciation for fans, with Ben Chilwell putting his arm around his close friend as they approached the tunnel. Mount later took to Instagram to send a message to Chelsea fans after what has undoubtedly been a challenging campaign. feed    It   s fair to say it   s been an up and down season but your support has never dipped," he began. "Travelling around the country, you were with us every step of the way and at times we didn   t deserve you. But now it   s time to have a break and recover... Thank you and enjoy your summer blues    Chelsea have not yet given up hope of keeping Mount, with Pochettino pushing to keep the England international, but club officials are prepared to cash in on one of their most valuable assets before he enters the final 12 months of his contract. Premier League rivals like Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United are all known to be keen to take advantage of the situation and are readying bids for the 24-year-old if he does hit the market.
