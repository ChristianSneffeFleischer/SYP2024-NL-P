Manchester United have seen a    70m offer for Barcelona's Dutch midfielder Frenkie de Jong knocked back, although they are not far off the Blaugrana's valuation as talks continue. Liverpool are in negotiations with Benfica over Darwin Nunez but are trying to negotiate down from the Portuguese side's    80m plus add-ons valuation. Discussions are ongoing regarding the structure of the deal, but both clubs expect an agreement to be reached. Potentially outgoing Reds star Sadio Mane has held talks with Bayern Munich manager Julian Nagelsmann, with the Bavarian giants impressed by his willingness to join and flexibility in terms of positioning.

Chelsea are interested in signing Man City's England international Raheem Sterling, although they could face competition from La Liga big hitters Real Madrid and Barcelona. Tottenham have beaten Nottingham Forest to the signature of Middlesbrough full-back Djed Spence, with a deal agreed between the clubs.

The Giallorossi have interest in left-back Nicola Zalewski from Borussia Dortmund, but they will turn down any offers that come their way.
