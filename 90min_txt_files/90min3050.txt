Paris Saint-Germain manager Christophe Galtier has revealed that he has 'laughed' with Presnel Kimpembe about reports linking the defender with a move to Chelsea. As reported by 90min, the Blues are keen to strengthen their backline this summer following the  departures of Antonio Rudiger and Andreas Christensen. They have already secured the signing of Napoli's Kalidou Koulibaly and they are eager to bring in two more centre-backs. Chelsea had also been close to re-signing Nathan Ake, but that deal fell apart as they could not agree on the payment of the structure of a  Â£45m fee to Manchester City. As a result, 90min understands that they have now turned their attention to Kimpembe, who could become available once PSG complete the signing of Inter's Milan Skriniar.  Listen now to 90min's Talking Transfers podcast, with  Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey,  Harry Symeou  &  Toby Cudworth. On the latest show they discuss Chelsea's interest in Antony and Serge Gnabry, why Man Utd have still not signed Frenkie de Jong, Man City's pursuit of Marc Cucurella and more.
