Manchester United have confirmed the signing of Mason Mount from Chelsea. The England international becomes the Red Devils' first incoming this summer, joining for an initial  £55m that could rise to  £60m if add-ons are met. 90min revealed in June that Chelsea were holding out for such a package worth  £60m, rejecting three bids from Man Utd before finally agreeing terms towards the end of the month. Erik ten Hag pushed hard to finalise the signing of Mount and has now got a priority midfield target through the Old Trafford door. manual Mount has left Chelsea after nearly two decades in west London, rising through the academy and becoming one of Cobham's most successful graduates. He played a starring role in the Blues' Champions League triumph of 2021, assisting Kai Havertz's winner against Manchester City. Mount departs Chelsea having made 195 appearances in all competitions, scoring 33 goals and assisting 37.
