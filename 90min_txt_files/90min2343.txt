Bayern Munich are considering a move to take Ilkay Gundogan back to Germany next summer, 90min understands. The 32-year-old has been in wonderful form for Manchester City in the early months of the season, featuring in a number of different roles for Pep Guardiola. Gundogan's current City contract, a four-year extension penned in 2019, expires next summer and there is a willingness from the Premier League champions to extend his stay at the Etihad. But sources have confirmed to 90min that Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich are tempted to offer him a route back to Germany next summer - seven years after he departed Borussia Dortmund in a deal worth  Â£20m. Scott Saunders  hosts  Graeme Bailey  and  Toby Cudworth  in the latest episode of Talking Transfers. The team discuss Cristiano Ronaldo's Man Utd future, interest in Naby Keita and a decision looming for Harry Kane. Available on  all audio platforms.
