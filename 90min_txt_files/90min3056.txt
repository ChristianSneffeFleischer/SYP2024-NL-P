Stade Reims have confirmed they have reached an agreement with Paris Saint-Germain for the sale of striker Hugo Ekitike, but also revealed the French champions are paying less than what Newcastle offered for him. Ekitike was close to joining Newcastle in the January transfer window, but the move fell through on deadline day. The Magpies returned for the 20-year-old forward this summer and he was one of Eddie Howe's top transfer targets, ultimately agreeing a deal. However, Newcastle refused to agree to terms with the player's agent and 90min revealed they backed away from the transfer. PSG have pushed ahead with a deal for Ekitike after failing to agree terms with Sassuolo for striker Gianluca Scamacca - who West Ham have now moved for. Listen now to 90min's Talking Transfers podcast, with  Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey,  Harry Symeou  &  Toby Cudworth. On the latest show they discuss Chelsea's interest in Antony and Serge Gnabry, why Man Utd have still not signed Frenkie de Jong, Man City's pursuit of Marc Cucurella and more.

Reims have now agreed a fee believed to be worth    30m plus add-ons, which will no doubt anger Newcastle who had agreed to a deal worth around    40m. And Reims president Jean-Pierre Caillot explained that although the fee PSG have offered is lower than Newcastle's, they could not stand in Ekitike's way.
