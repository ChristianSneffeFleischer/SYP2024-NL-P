Sevilla have set an initial asking price of between    65m and    70m for highly-rated defender Jules Kounde, with Manchester United and Real Madrid eyeing a summer move for the Frenchman.  The 22-year-old's current contract features a release clause of    80m ( £69m), but he has recently expressed his desire to move to a bigger club, putting pressure on the Spanish outfit to sell their starlet.  And Mundo Deportivo reports that Sevilla have set an asking price of between    65m ( £56m) and    70m ( £60m) for Kounde, as they prepare for a summer of negotiation with Europe's heavyweights.  Sporting director Monchi is not happy with the club's decision to negotiate below the release clause, but the talented defender made his intentions clear in a recent interview, when he dropped a major hint to any interested parties.  Kounde revealed that he has ambitions of playing for a bigger club in Europe, and hinted that 'we'll see what the future holds.'      Going to Sevilla seemed to be the best option to try to improve myself and I don   t regret my choice,    he said.    I   m already at a big club, but obviously I   d like to play for an even bigger club. We   ll see what the future holds for me, but it   s something that   s in my head."
