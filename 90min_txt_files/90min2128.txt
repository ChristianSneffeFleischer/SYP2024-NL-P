Wolves will have to fend off interest from rival Premier League sides if they are to complete a deal to sign Atletico Madrid's Matheus Cunha, 90min understands. As revealed earlier this month, Wolves were hopeful of striking a double deal with Atletico to land both defender Felipe and striker Cunha, the latter of whom is expected to leave Spain on a loan deal with a view to a permanent exit. Cunha is interested in working with Wolves boss Julen Lopetegui but sources have confirmed to 90min that he wants to explore all his options before making a final decision. Indeed, Cunha's representatives have been contacted by Aston Villa, Everton and Leeds, all of whom are actively trying to strike a deal for the Brazilian. In searching for a new club, Cunha's entourage have also offered the 23-year-old to Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Newcastle United, and thanks to the club-friendly nature of the deal, many of the sides contacted have yet to rule out a move. Atletico are desperate to offload Cunha's wages and would be prepared to sanction a loan move, which has piqued the interest of a number of teams ahead of the January transfer window.
