Sporting CP have agreed terms with Barcelona to sign Hector Bellerin, paving the way for Pedro Porro to finalise his move to Tottenham Hotspur, 90min understands. Bellerin joined Barca last summer after his contract with Arsenal was terminated, but he has only ever been on the fringes of Xavi's first-team squad at the Camp Nou. The 27-year-old has now been offered an escape route after Sporting agreed an initial loan deal until the end of the season. The Portuguese giants made their move after deciding to accept Tottenham's approach for Porro, with the Londoners set to pay    45m for the Spanish international in instalments. Porro agreed terms with Spurs earlier this week, but he has been waiting for Sporting to give him the green-light to confirm his move - with only a medical needed. That medical is now due to be completed on Monday after Sporting finalise the Bellerin deal. Sporting spent the last few days looking for a right-back, and that included asking about Brighton's Tariq Lamptey.
