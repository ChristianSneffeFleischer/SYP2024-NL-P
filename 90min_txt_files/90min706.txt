Chelsea have rejected Manchester United's third bid for Mason Mount, but have made a counter offer as they look to finalise terms, sources have confirmed to 90min. The 24-year-old's contract at Stamford Bridge expires next summer and talks over an extension have failed to yield an agreement despite months of negotiations between the two parties. United are looking to make Mount their first signing of the summer and have previously had two bids for Mount turned down by Chelsea. 90min revealed earlier on Friday that a third bid worth  £55m including add-ons had been lodged. But Chelsea have turned down United's latest offer and have counter proposed a deal of  £58m guaranteed plus  £7m in add-ons. The Blues have accepted that Mount's future now lies away from west London and they've indicated a willingness to strike an agreement with United, whose manager Erik ten Hag is keen to push through a deal. feed United had threatened to walk away from talks if Chelsea rejected their third offer, but sources have confirmed to 90min that the two parties are still talking and there's confidence of a deal being done. Mount has already agreed personal terms in principle with United and is seen as a key signing for Ten Hag as the club prepare to return to the Champions League. The England international has made 195 appearances for Chelsea and scored 33 goals, lifting the Champions League in 2021 after a 1-0 win over Manchester City in the final. Mount has also tasted success in the UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup but endured a troubled 2022/23 campaign after struggling with injury and a drop in form.
