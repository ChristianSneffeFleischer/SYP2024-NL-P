The 19-year-old is expected to link-up and playing a starring role with England at the upcoming World Cup in Qatar, with an impressive few months of early-season form under his belt. There's been plenty of talk about what Bellingham will do next, but 90min previously confirmed that no decisions would be made by the player, his representatives or his family until the World Cup has passed - though they are fully aware of the clubs tracking him. Amid all of the noise and ongoing speculation, 90min understands that Borussia Dortmund remain confident that they can keep Bellingham at the club beyond the end of this season. Real Madrid, Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea, Manchester United, Bayern Munich, Juventus and Paris Saint Germain have all confirmed their interest in recent months, but there's a feeling in Germany that Bellingham may be convinced to hold station for another year. Sources with knowledge of the situation have told 90min that Dortmund fully believe that Bellingham isn't determined to leave this summer and that the chances of him staying are good. Nevertheless, Real Madrid, Liverpool and Manchester City all believe they are well placed to win the race for Bellingham; Dortmund think another year in the Bundesliga would be the best decision for the teenager to make.
