Exclusive - Aston Villa's pursuit of Jamaican winger Leon Bailey has been complicated by interest from a number of other Premier League clubs. Villa were first to show their interest in Bailey, although his current club Bayer Leverkusen were quick to outline that they wanted more than  Â£25m. 90min understands that Villa have not been put off by that figure, and have instead firmed up their interest by engaging in dialogue with both the club and his representatives. But Dean Smith's side are not the only Premier League outfit in the running, as Midlands rivals Leicester City are among a number of other clubs tracking the 23-year-old. Everton, Wolves and Southampton are also keen, while Bailey has previously been on the radar of heavyweight trio Liverpool, Chelsea and Manchester City.  At this stage, there's no indication that any of the latter are prepared to make a move, although Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool are in the market for another forward and have held talks with Watford over Ismaila Sarr. Bailey, who England manager Gareth Southgate previously enquired about over his eligibility to play for the Three Lions, is currently with the Jamaican squad at the Gold Cup, although their tournament is now over after a 1-0 defeat to USA in Monday's quarter-final. He will concentrate on his own future upon his return to Germany, and sources close to the player have told 90min that Bailey feels the time is right to leave Leverkusen - having spent four years at the club after joining from Belgian Pro League side Genk.
