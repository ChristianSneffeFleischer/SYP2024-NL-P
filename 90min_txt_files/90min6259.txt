Chelsea are said to be considering the possibility of bringing in a new goalkeeper even if Kepa Arrizabalaga stays put this summer, while still looking for a long-term replacement if they can sell him for an acceptable fee.  Kepa became the world's most expensive goalkeeper when he made the switch to west London in 2018, but he has since made a number of costly errors for his side. The 25-year-old was even dropped to the bench in February as a result of his high-profile mistakes, with Willy Caballero stepping into the side in his place.  Kepa + money for Jan Oblak. How likely do you think this move is to happen? ? pic.twitter.com/E6q39K9nK5 The former Athletic Club goalkeeper has since regained his place in the side, but question marks remain over his long-term future at the club, with manager Frank Lampard unconvinced by his qualities. Chelsea have been linked with a large number of shot-stoppers in recent months, but most recently, it has been suggested that the Blues could look to include Kepa as part of an unlikely deal that would bring Atletico Madrid's Jan Oblak to Stamford Bridge.  Loan moves abroad have also been suggested, but this too may prove challenging. Of course, the Blues could try to offload him permanently, but it's seemingly unlikely they will receive an offer that would meet their valuation. The Telegraph now report that the Premier League club are considering other options as they prepare for all eventualities.
