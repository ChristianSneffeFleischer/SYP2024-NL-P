Chelsea are considering proposing a swap deal for Kingsley Coman that would see Bayern Munich finally land long-term target Callum Hudson-Odoi.  The Bundesliga champions have been admirers of Hudson-Odoi for years, stretching back to January 2019. A deal collapsed, however, and he has since signed a new deal at Stamford Bridge.  Bayern look likely to place a fresh bid of Chelsea's Callum Hudson-Odoi this summer. Will they land him this time? ? It's been far from plain-sailing for the winger since, however. He's been in and out of the Chelsea team, struggling to earn the faith of both Frank Lampard and Thomas Tuchel over the past two seasons, and speculation about his long-term future has never really gone away.  It was reported in June that Bayern's interest had dissipated in the 20-year-old, and that came to light around the time that 90min learned Borussia Dortmund were considering bids for both him and Tammy Abraham.   Now, however, it is being reported by L'Equipe that Chelsea have sensed an opportunity. The newspaper, whose report is carried by GFFN, say the Blues want Bayern winger Kingsley Coman, and are looking into the possibility of swapping the two wingers.  Tuchel is a huge admirer of Coman's, and Chelsea are said to be keen to bring him in, but Bayern's asking price - around    90m - rules out a straight purchase. The club feel that including Hudson-Odoi in a deal would keep the price down to a minimum, but it remains to be seen how Bayern value him.
