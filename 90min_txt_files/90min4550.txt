Bayern Munich have told German star Jerome Boateng that he is free to leave the club this summer, as they have no intention of extending his contract, which expires at the end of the season.  The 32-year-old has spent the past decade with Die Roten, winning everything there is on offer at club level, including two Champions League trophies and nine consecutive league titles.  But Boateng's successful period at Bayern appears to be coming to an end, as Kicker reports that the Bundesliga champions have told the centre-back they are not prepared to extend his contract beyond the end of this season. This will certainly attract attention from around Europe - particularly from the Premier League.  The former Manchester City star is being linked with a potential move to English giants Arsenal or Chelsea, and they'd both be delighted to land such an experienced and decorated defender on a free transfer.  The Blues have enjoyed great success in securing a similar deal to sign former Paris Saint-Germain captain Thiago Silva this season, and may look to explore this option once again. The Gunners are in dire need of improvements to their backline, and a man of Boateng's stature could help whip them into shape.
