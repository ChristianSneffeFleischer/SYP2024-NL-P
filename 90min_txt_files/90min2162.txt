Paris Saint-Germain president Nasser Al-Khelaifi has lifted the lid on Lionel Messi's future, confirming they will discuss his contract situation in January. Messi made the move to PSG in the summer of 2021 after Barcelona were unable to find a way to sign him to a new contract amid their financial crisis, and after a slow first season in the French capital, the Argentine has found form again. The 35-year-old penned a two-year deal with an option for a third, but his future at the club remains up in the air amid interest from the MLS. 90min understands Inter Miami are in discussions with Messi's camp over a potential deal and are willing to meet his wage demands to make it happen. Al-Khelaifi spoke to Sky Sports on the situation regarding Messi during the World Cup break, and was positive about his future: "He's very happy, you can see that with the national team. If a player's not happy you will see their performance not good for the national team." He added: "He performed fantastic this season for us, he's scored a lot of goals and assists for the national team and for the club. "So what we agreed together - that after the World Cup, sit down together. But both sides - our side of the club and him - are very happy, so we will talk after the World Cup."
