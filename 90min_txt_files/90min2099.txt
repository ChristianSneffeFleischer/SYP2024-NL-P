Chelsea are confident that they have won the race for Brazilian youngster Andrey Santos, 90min understands. The 18-year-old midfielder was a long-term target for Newcastle United, who were close to securing a deal with his club Vasco da Gama after beating off competition from the likes of Paris Saint Germain.  However, as 90min confirmed, Chelsea and Barcelona both made moves to try and win the race for Santos, and the Stamford Bridge giants believe they are now well placed to seal a deal. Sources close to Chelsea have indicated to 90min that they hope an agreement will be tied up before the January window opens, at which point they will announce a deal - believed to be worth around  £12m but possibly rising to around  £20m including add-ons.
