West Ham United have agreed a deal to sign Aston Villa striker Danny Ings, 90min understands, and hope to finalise the transfer before this Saturday's crucial clash with Everton. The Hammers have been seeking additional firepower up front as they bid to turn a wretched run of form around that has seen the club plunge into the relegation zone. Interest was shown in Sevilla striker Youssef En-Nesyri earlier in the month, while Lorient's Terem Moffi remains a target despite rival interest from Nice and other Premier League clubs. West Ham have now turned to Ings, who has scored six goals in 18 Premier League games this season for Villa - though he has only started eight of those games - and 90min understands that a transfer worth  Â£15m has been agreed. Listen now as  Scott Saunders  hosts  Graeme Bailey  and  Toby Cudworth  in the latest episode of Talking Transfers. This week's agenda includes Jude Bellingham, Harry Kane, Declan Rice, Hakim Ziyech, Leandro Trossard, Pedro Porro, Mykhaylo Mudryk and more!
