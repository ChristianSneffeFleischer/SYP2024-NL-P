Real Madrid have a reputation for being particularly frugal in the January transfer window, and manager Carlo Ancelotti has already made it clear that he neither wants nor expects much movement this winter. That being said, there will still be a lot going on at the Santiago Bernabeu and there are a handful of issues which Real should try and address as soon as they get the chance. Let's take a look. With an expensive summer on the horizon, Real could do with every cent they can find.Expiring contracts could see Gareth Bale, Isco and Marcelo could all be sold on for minor sums in January, while the likes of Mariano Diaz, Dani Ceballos and Jesus Vallejo could also all be sold without really impacting the squad.None of that group are going to generate too much money, but every little helps. Real are now free to speak directly to and negotiate with Kylian Mbappe, and they would be wise to do so as soon as possible.The upcoming Champions League tie between the two clubs has complicated this and Real are reluctant to do anything to harm their relationship with the Parisians, so don't expect a deal to be agreed in January.However, a simple message to tell Mbappe personally that there's definitely a spot waiting for him next summer would be a good step. The expectancy is that Real will make an offer to Chelsea centre-back Antonio Rudiger, who is increasingly set to become a free agent.The German has been outstanding under Thomas Tuchel and deserves a nice pay day somewhere, but Real shouldn't throw a blank cheque at him.Rudiger, who turns 29 in March, has had a patchy few years at Chelsea and concerns over whether he can fit into a two-man defence are valid. If he struggles in Spain, like the last man to leave Chelsea for Real, a big contract could be something Real regret pretty quickly.
