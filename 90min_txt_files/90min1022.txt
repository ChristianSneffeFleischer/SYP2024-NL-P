Borussia Dortmund sporting director Sebastian Kehl said the club is preparing for 'different scenarios' when quizzed on the future of midfielder Jude Bellingham. England international Bellingham is expected to complete a move to Real Madrid this summer. Los Blancos have been chasing the youngster and 90min understands he has agreed the terms of a six-year deal at the Bernabeu. The transfer is expected to be worth an initial    100m with a further    50m in add-ons. It leaves BVB in need of a replacement as they look to go one better next season and win the Bundesliga after missing out on the title on the final day of the 2023/24 campaign. Kehl has now admitted Bellingham's future will be decided shortly. He told Bild: "I assume that there will now be movement in the personnel. We know that the player is of great value to us, that he has an ongoing contract with no release clause. Everything else will be revealed in the near future. We are preparing for different scenarios!" manual Kehl has previously been quizzed on Bellingham's future, most recently asserting that the club's total focus was on that unsuccessful league bid. The 19-year-old netted eight goals and contributed four more assists in the 2022/23 Bundesliga season but Bellingham was unable to play in the 2-2 draw with Mainz which helped Bayern usurp Dortmund in the German standings. There are fears he may require knee surgery, potentially ruling him out of England's Euro 2024 qualifiers this summer. Gareth Southgate's squad will meet on the weekend of the Champions League final before fixtures with Malta and North Macedonia in Group C.
