RB Leipzig executive Oliver Mintzlaff has warned Chelsea that they have no plans to offload centre-back Josko Gvardiol. After failing with a move for the Croatia international earlier this summer, Chelsea have opened talks with Leipzig over a  £77m move which would see Gvardiol return to the Red Bull Arena for the remainder of the 2022/23 season. 90min understands there is a confidence that the deal will be completed in the near future, but Mintzlaff has warned Chelsea that selling Gvardiol is not part of Leipzig's plans. "Josko is a great player who will certainly arouse a lot of interest - he still has a contract with us until 2026," he said. "We assume that he will not only play with us this season, but also next season." Leipzig have made it clear to Chelsea that they are not prepared to sell Gvardiol this summer - that was their stance even before fellow defender Lukas Klostermann went under the knife to address an ankle injury - but the Blues are hopeful of convincing them to sell next year instead. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  &  Toby Cudworth  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Lucas Paqueta's move to West Ham, Chelsea's plans to sign Anthony Gordon, Wesley Fofana and Arsen Zakharyan and the latest from Old Trafford.

Chelsea have spent the last few months chasing Leicester's Wesley Fofana, for whom three bids were rejected before a fee of over  £75m was finally agreed between the two clubs after weeks and weeks of tricky negotiations. Those in charge at Stamford Bridge are keen to avoid a similar drawn-out saga next summer, by which point Thiago Silva will be 38 and out of contract, so plans are being made now to line up Gvardiol's arrival in 2023.
