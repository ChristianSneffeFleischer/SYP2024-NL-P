Erik ten Hag has admitted that while he 'needs' a new striker added to his Manchester United ranks this month, he does not want the club to 'burn money' doing so. The Red Devils are on the hunt for a new forward following the mutual termination of Cristiano Ronaldo's contract back in November, though they have seen key target Cody Gakpo sign for Liverpool in recent days. Marcus Rashford has returned to top form this season, while Anthony Martial has looked promising on the rare occasions that he's been fit to play from the off. Speaking ahead of United's Premier League clash with Bournemouth, Ten Hag discussed plans to bring in a new striker. "We have a good team when all the players are available. But with many games coming up, I think there is a need [for a striker]," he said. "You need one who can have an impact, otherwise you are just burning money." Ten Hag then spoke specifically about Martial's quiet performance against Wolves on New Year's Eve, insisting he still has faith in the Frenchman despite the off day.
