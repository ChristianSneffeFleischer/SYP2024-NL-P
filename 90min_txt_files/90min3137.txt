AC Milan have agreed personal terms with Charles De Ketelaere, but they are yet to agree a fee with his current club Club Brugge, 90min understands.  De Ketelaere has been attracting interest from across Europe this summer after another season in Belgium. The attacking midfielder netted 14 goals and also chipped in with seven assists last campaign as Club Brugge secured second spot in the Jupiler Pro League.  As reported by 90min last month, Leicester had been confident of winning the race for De Ketelaere. However, Milan have now moved into pole position.  Sources have indicated that the Rossoneri have agreed personal terms with the 21-year-old, who has been enticed by the prospect of Champions League football at San Siro.  Leicester have not given up hope in convincing him to opt for a move to the Premier League instead, although they now accept that the player is more likely to join Milan.  Leeds are also interested, but 90min understands that the Whites face an uphill task to convince him to move to Elland Road.   Despite being favourites to sign De Ketelaere, Milan are yet to hammer out a deal with Club Brugge. An initial    20m bid was rejected, but 90min has been informed the Italian champions are ready to increase their offer to    30m.
