Real Madrid are expected to reward Vinicius Junior with a new and improved long-term contract after holding talks with his representatives. The 21-year-old has been in electrifying form for most of the campaign, firing home 17 La Liga goals to help Carlo Ancelotti's men canter to the title ahead of Barcelona and Sevilla, and his current deal at Santiago Bernabeu runs until 2024. Vinicius has also shone on the European stage for Ancelotti, playing in all 12 of Real Madrid's Champions League games this season, and he'll likely line up on the left flank against Liverpool in the competition's final - to be played on 28 May at the Stade de France in Paris. In an interview with TNT Sports back in October, Vinicius excitedly spoke of the possibility of signing a contract extension at Real Madrid - noting that he was 'very relaxed' about talks opening in the  months ahead while adding 'of course, I want to renew and stay here a long time'. A decision was then made in December to push talks out until the end of the season, and Marca now note that Real are 'working on the operation' that will lead to extending Vinicius' contract. Listen now to 90min's brand new podcast, Talking Transfers, with Scott Saunders, Graeme Bailey & Toby Cudworth. On this week's agenda is Erling Haaland's transfer to Manchester City, Ralf Rangnick recommending Konrad Laimer to Manchester United and the latest on the contract situations of Youri Tielemans and Sadio Mane. The report states that an agreement has not yet been found, but both the club and Vinicius' entourage believe they are working towards concluding a deal - with talks so far said to have been 'harmonious'.
