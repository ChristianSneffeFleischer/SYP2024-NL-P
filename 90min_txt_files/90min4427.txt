Manchester City have made signing a new striker a priority ahead of their Premier League title defence next season. Veteran striker and club legend Sergio Aguero will leave at the end of the season, with Barcelona making him a two-year contract offer ahead of a potential summer switch to Camp Nou. Pep Guardiola has often played without a recognised striker throughout the backend of the season, though some stellar frontmen have still been linked. The Telegraph state a new 'world class' striker is a priority for the Premier League champions, and mention Harry Kane, Erling Haaland and Romelu Lukaku as possible targets. However, none of those three are explicitly on the market. There also remains a strong interest in Aston Villa captain Jack Grealish. The England international, who came off the bench in Villa's Premier League fixture against Everton on Thursday as he continues his comeback from injury, has had arguably his best top flight season and is frequently linked with a move away from Birmingham. City's local rivals Manchester United have often been touted as a potential destination, and while there is a longstanding admiration in him from Guardiola, City would pursue a striker before making a play for the Villa captain. 72    | Welcome back, skip!? 0-0 ? #AVLEVE pic.twitter.com/Tj7xU88gd2
