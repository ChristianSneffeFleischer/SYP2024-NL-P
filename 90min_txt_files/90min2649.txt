Bournemouth and Southampton have held talks with Arsenal over a deal to sign versatile midfielder Ainsley Maitland-Niles, 90min can confirm. The 24-year-old, whose contract expires next summer, has just returned from a loan spell with Roma and is now expected to leave the club, with manager Mikel Arteta keen to trim down his squad. Sources have confirmed that both Bournemouth and Southampton have expressed an interest in Maitland-Niles and have opened talks with Arsenal about bringing the Englishman in before the end of the transfer window. The two clubs are both eyeing a loan deal for Maitland-Niles, whose expiring contract means Arsenal will have to make a decision as they risk losing their academy graduate for free in 2023. Potential options to buy are also being discussed as part of Arsenal's negotiations with the two teams.
