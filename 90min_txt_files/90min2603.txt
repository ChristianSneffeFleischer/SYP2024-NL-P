PSV Eindhoven forward Cody Gakpo has insisted Antony's impending move to Ajax will not impact his future, with the Dutchman claiming to have plenty of offers on the table. The 23-year-old forward still has four years remaining on his contract but is expected to leave PSV this summer after falling to Rangers in the qualification rounds for this season's Champions League. Among his suitors are United, who have agreed a    100m fee to sign another Eredivisie star in the form of Antony, but United officials have also been keeping a close eye on Gakpo and have not ruled out moving for both. After Sunday's 6-1 win over Excelsior, in which Gakpo racked up a goal and two assists, the Dutchman congratulated Antony on his transfer and revealed he expects an answer on his future soon. "Fun for [Antony]...but for me and my future, I think that has no influence," Gakpo told ESPN. "It's like a puzzle so in the next few days I will see which puzzle fits best. For me, it'd certainly not be bad to stay at PSV. We'll see."

I try to focus and not listen to it, but that is difficult."
