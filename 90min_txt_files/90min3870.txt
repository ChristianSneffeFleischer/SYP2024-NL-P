Kylian Mbappe was    very pleased    with how Real Madrid conducted themselves over the transfer window and underpinned his belief that they are the right club for him, 90min has learned. It's also 90min's understanding that the Paris Saint Germain superstar has yet to agree terms with Los Blancos over a prospective move to the Spanish capital in 2022, but his mind is already made up. Mbappe was the subject of a couple of bids from Real in the closing week of the transfer window and he had hoped an agreement would be found. Despite the fact a move did not happen, sources close to the player have confirmed that their attempts went down very well.    Real made a concerted effort, they showed Kylian how much they wanted him     they acted professionally, and he knows they did all they could to get it done now, he was very pleased with how they acted,    a source confirmed to 90min. Real had made it clear to PSG earlier in the summer that they were ready to make a bid, but the Ligue 1 giants outlined he was not available as they wanted at least one season of Mbappe playing alongside new signing Lionel Messi. PSG still hold out hope that Mbappe can be persuaded to sign a new contract, despite the fact for over 12 months the player has made it clear that he will not be re-signing. Mbappe reiterated to them that was the case, despite their summer of big signings including the likes of Messi, Sergio Ramos and Gianluigi Donnarumma. Mbappe also confirmed to a number of team-mates that he hoped to join Real this summer. That left some at the Parc des Princes feeling the best course of action would be to let Mbappe leave, and sporting director Leonardo intimated that if they recouped the    180m they paid Monaco for him, they would do business in August.
