Stoke City have finalised the signing of centre-back Axel Tuanzebe on loan from Manchester United. Tuanzebe, who spent last season on loan with Napoli, failed to make a single appearance during the first half of the campaign. The 25-year-old has now moved to Stoke on loan, filling the void left by Harry Souttar's move to Leicester City. The loan is Tuanzebe's fifth since his emergence from the United academy, three of which were with Aston Villa before last season's move to Naples. Speaking about the signing, club manager Alex Neil said:    It was important that we added to our defensive resources and Axel is a player who knows the Championship and is keen to test himself at this level again.    With his United contract set to expire at the end of the season, Tuanzebe appears to have played his final game for the Red Devils.
