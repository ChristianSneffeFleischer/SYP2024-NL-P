Brentford have completed the signing of Albanian goalkeeper Thomas Strakosha on a three-year deal with option for a further 12 months. The 27-year-old joins as a free agent after leaving Lazio, where he made 208 appearances in all competitions after graduating from the club's academy. Strakosha had been in talks with Manchester United as the Red Devils look to replace Dean Henderson, who has joined Nottingham Forest on loan, but he has opted to chance his arm in the Premier League with Brentford - where he will compete with Spain goalkeeper David Raya for the number one jersey. "I am pleased that we have managed to sign a top goalkeeper," manager Thomas Frank said of Strakosha's arrival.  "He has been number one at Lazio for a long time, which is very impressive. He has played in Serie A and European competition and will bring that experience with him. He fits our goalkeeper model and comes in to a good environment with David Raya and Matthew Cox pushing each other every day."
