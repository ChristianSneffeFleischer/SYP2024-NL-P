Both Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur are considering bids for Leeds United midfielder Kalvin Phillips at the end of the season. Phillips, who was a core part of Leeds' Championship title triumph, has enjoyed an impressive start to life in the top flight, with his good form earning him a place in Gareth Southgate's England squad during the last international break. Marcelo Bielsa watched Phillips in action for England, and according to the Mirror, both J  rgen Klopp and Jos   Mourinho kept a close eye on him too, having been impressed with his performances for Leeds this season. The two managers are now said to be considering summer moves for Phillips, who is valued at close to  £50m by the chiefs at Elland Road. Klopp may be forced to look for a replacement for Georginio Wijnaldum, who is in the final year of his contract and has attracted interest from Barcelona. In anticipation of his departure, Klopp has ordered Liverpool scouts to track Phillips. Mourinho has done the same as he prepares to continue his squad rebuild. Defensive midfield is high on the Spurs boss' list of priorities, with Moussa Sissoko recently turning 31 and Eric Dier spending more time as a centre-back these days, and Phillips has been identified as a potential target. Leeds would look for  £50m if they are to sell Phillips, but it is suggested that they might even demand more as they do not want to part ways with the England international whatsoever. However, both Liverpool and Spurs would be prepared to double his  £30,000-a-week wages, which may turn Phillips' head. Leeds currently sit eighth in the Premier League, having lost just one of their four matches so far - the 4-3 loss to defending champions Liverpool on the opening day of the season.
