Adrien Rabiot has signed a new one-year contract at Juventus, ending Manchester United's hopes of luring him to Old Trafford on a free transfer. The France international was first courted by the Red Devils last summer, but they could not reach an agreement on personal terms and he ended up staying at the Allianz Stadium. Rabiot then had his best season in a Bianconeri shirt to date, proving to be one of their more reliable performers in a campaign which was rocked by allegations of the club's financial mismanagement. His contract was due to expire at the end of June and Man Utd's interest was still lingering, with Juve in the dark until recently over his decision. feed But Rabiot has now put pen to paper on a new one-year contract in Turin. In a statement, Juventus said: "Adrien renews until 30 June 2024 and is ready to experience more emotions with the black and white shirt. 177 appearances, 17 goals scored and three trophies won (a Scudetto, an Italian Cup and an Italian Super Cup): this is the loot accumulated up to now, destined to be enriched again. "The story is not finished, we still have roads to go side by side and we are ready to continue running together towards our goals. Congratulations, Adrien!"
