Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has confirmed that Barcelona are close to striking a deal to sign forward Ferran Torres. 90min understands a deal worth    60m has been agreed to take Torres to Camp Nou in January, with coach Xavi identifying the Spaniard as a top priority to bolster his attack following the recent enforced retirement of ex-City star Sergio Aguero. Torres' future was the first matter on the agenda during Thursday's press conference, in which Guardiola did not shy away from discussing the transfer.    I hear it was very close but I have not heard from my club that it is already done, nothing official," Guardiola said.    They are negotiating. When the club confirm, it   s done, but Txiki [Begiristain, director] didn   t say to me it   s done.    When asked whether he plans to replace Torres in January, Guardiola simply responded:    We are not going to bring in a striker." Despite not wanting to lose Torres, the boss insisted that he was never going to stand in the way of the 21-year-old after he admitted that he wants to leave City. Based on current form, who would you want in your team?Welcome To World Class | #W2WC21    I always have the feeling when FC Barcelona and Real Madrid knock on the door it   s hard to say no,    Guardiola continued.    In terms of fashion and cities and many reasons. When he knocked on my door and said he wants to leave, I said 'leave'. I want happiness in my players. If you are not happy, you have to leave. We are not a club where presidents and CEO say 'no, you have to stay'.
