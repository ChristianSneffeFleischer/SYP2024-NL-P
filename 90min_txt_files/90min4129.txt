Radiotelevisione Italiana journalist Paolo Paganini has claimed live on air at Radio Kiss Kiss (yes, that's Radio Kiss Kiss) that Tottenham have made an offer for Napoli and Italy's Lorenzo Insigne.  Paganini also stated that Maurizio Sarri's Lazio are heavily interested in the winger, with the former Chelsea boss keen on uniting the Euro 2020 champion with Ciro Immobile and Felipe Anderson, who Lazio have resigned from West Ham. "In Italy, especially Lazio has moved for the player in the presence of Maurizio Sarri. The coach dreams of an attack with Insigne, Immobile and Anderson," Paganini is quoted as saying by Area Napoli. However, the journalist also said that the Italian club do not have the financial resources to acquire the services of Insigne without offering a player in a swap deal. He claims that the most significant interest has come from Tottenham, who have reportedly made an offer. The Premier League club have been linked with the winger in the past, although no speculation has ever come to fruition. However Paganini revealed on air that among Insigne's many potential suitors, Tottenham have actually made the most noteworthy offer. "The most important offers came from abroad, especially from Tottenham. After the European Championship, Lorenzo has many new admirers," said Paganini. As well as Son Heung-min, Tottenham currently have Lucas Moura, Erik Lamela, and Steven Bergwijn as options in wide areas - the latter of which has previously been touted as a potential departure this summer, however.
