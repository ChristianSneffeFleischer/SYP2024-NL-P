One of football's longest-running transfer sagas is finally at an end - Jude Bellingham has joined Real Madrid.   The midfielder has put pen to paper on a six-year deal at the club, with Los Blancos paying an initial    100m fee for his services. Bellingham is set to become the first Englishman since David Beckham to bear the white of Real Madrid. But which number will accompany him on those famous old strips? Here is Bellingham's shirt number history and the options currently available to him at the Santiago Bernabeu. feed Ever since breaking into Birmingham City's first team as a 16-year-old, Bellingham has only worn one number at club level - 22. There are a few other numbers that Bellingham has donned while on international duty with England at various age levels. In addition to his favourite 22, Bellingham has also adorned the numbers 7, 8, 10, 18, 19, 21, 23 and 26. Well, Jude, I'm afraid I've got some bad news - none of the shirt numbers you've previously worn in your career are currently up for grabs at Real Madrid. The number 7 is taken by Vinicius Junior, 8 by Toni Kroos, 18 by Aurelien Tchouameni, 21 by a returning Brahim Diaz, 22 by Antonio Rudiger and 23 by Ferland Mendy. The number 26 is forbidden for senior players due to La Liga registration rules decreeing they must wear shirts between one and 25. With Diaz likely to leave once again this summer, following a loan move to AC Milan during the 2022/23 season, the number 21 jersey could become available for the midfielder.  If Bellingham doesn't fancy that, then the numbers 14 and 25 are available to him too.
