Juventus have confirmed the signing of striker Arkadiusz Milik on a season-long loan from Marseille. With Paulo Dybala leaving the club on a free transfer and Alvaro Morata returning to Atletico Madrid after his own loan spell, Juve were keen to bring in a new forward this summer and were in talks for both Milik and Barcelona's Memphis Depay. A deal for the Dutchman has slowed in recent days though, so Juventus have pushed ahead with a deal to sign Milik, who joins on a season-long loan which includes an option to buy. Juve will have the chance to land Milik permanently for    7m, with a further    2m in add-ons. The 28-year-old Poland international has endured a torrid time with injuries over the past few seasons, but has still managed an impressive return in front of goal when healthy. He managed 20 goals in 37 games in all competitions for Marseille last season, having fired ten in 16 the year before. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey,  Toby Cudworth  and  Harry Symeou  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Antony attempting to push through a move to Man Utd, Frenkie de Jong and Pierre-Emerick Aubayemang's futures at Barcelona and Arsenal's interest in Pedro Neto.

Milik has long been on Juve's radar after an impressive few years on the books at Serie A rivals Napoli. Injuries took their toll during 2016/17 and 2017/18, but in the two years that followed, Milik hit 28 league goals in 61 games. He came fifth in Serie A's scoring charts in 2018/19, four goals behind then-Juve man Cristiano Ronaldo.
