Leicester have completed the signing of Brazilian winger Tete from Shakhtar Donetsk on a six-month loan until the end of the season. Tete had been on loan with Lyon but the French side were keen to terminate his agreement and move in a different direction, prompting interest from a number of Premier League sides in the 22-year-old. Leeds registered their interest late on but Leicester managed to get a deal over the line and they have now confirmed Tete's arrival at the King Power Stadium. Tete joins until the end of the 2022/23 season, after which he is currently scheduled to return to Ukraine with Shakhtar. "I   m really happy to be here," Tete told club media. "I   ve had a look at the pitch and the stadium, it   s beautiful and I can already imagine what it   ll be like with a lot of fans. I hope to score a lot of goals and assists. I hope they   ll all be happy to see me play, I   m happy to be a Fox." Listen now as  Scott Saunders  hosts  Graeme Bailey  and  Toby Cudworth  to discuss the latest transfer news.
