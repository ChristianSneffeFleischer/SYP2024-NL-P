Manchester City have accepted a bid from Saudi Arabian side Al Ahli for winger Riyad Mahrez, 90min understands. A  £45m-a-year contract has been offered to Mahrez, whose interest was piqued earlier this summer, and the Algeria international spoke with Pep Guardiola recently to confirm his desire to leave the club and head to the Middle East. Guardiola, while reluctant to lose Mahrez, has a policy of never blocking an exit for an unhappy player and the manager made it clear to City's decision-makers that they should listen to offers from Al Ahli. A fee of around  £30m has now been agreed between the two clubs, with Mahrez due to fly to Saudi Arabia for a medical ahead of putting pen to paper on a contract. Should all go to plan, Mahrez will become Al Ahli's third blockbuster signing of the summer. The Saudi side signed Roberto Firmino on a free transfer after his Liverpool contract expired and later struck a deal to sign goalkeeper Edouard Mendy from Chelsea. feed City are now looking for a replacement for Mahrez and had been among the suitors of Brazilian international Malcom, who is also heading out to Saudi Arabia to join Al Hilal. There has also been a renewed effort from City to keep unsettled midfielder Bernardo Silva. The Portugal international, like Mahrez, has asked to leave the club this summer, and while City have begrudgingly put an asking price of around  £75m on his head, they do not want to lose the 28-year-old. Barcelona are keen to lure Silva over to Camp Nou, but Paris Saint-Germain are all known admirers of the midfielder. Silva also has his own interest from Saudi Arabia.
