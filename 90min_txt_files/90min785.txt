Hakim Ziyech is set to finalise a move from Chelsea to Saudi Arabia's Al-Nassr, 90min understands, with Kalidou Koulibaly also closing in on a transfer to the Middle East. Chelsea are looking to raise money this summer, both in response to two windows of heavy spending and to fund more business this year, with Ziyech and Koulibaly among a number of players available for transfer. Blues co-owner Todd Boehly was recently in Saudi Arabia for meetings with a number of football officials, and the availability of Chelsea's fringe players was among the topics of conversation. The Saudi chiefs have moved quickly and sources have confirmed to 90min that Ziyech will be the first Chelsea player to head over to the Middle East this summer. Ziyech has agreed a three-year deal to link up with Cristiano Ronaldo at Al-Nassr and will soon undergo a medical before putting pen to paper on the move. feed As for Koulibaly, talks are progressing over a move to Al-Hilal. The former Napoli centre-back has turned down a loan switch back to Serie A in favour of a permanent transfer to Saudi Arabia. An agreement over personal terms is close to being finalised, with a three-year contract until 2026 also on the table for the 31-year-old. Goalkeeper Edouard Mendy has also agreed a three-year contract with Al Ahli, who are now seeking an agreement over a transfer fee with Chelsea. A deal is expected to be completed later this week. Elsewhere, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang remains in talks over a move to Saudi Arabia but is yet to agree a deal. Romelu Lukaku has been targeted but is keen to remain in Europe, while Callum Hudson-Odoi has been also discussed but is not currently interested in a move to the Middle East.
