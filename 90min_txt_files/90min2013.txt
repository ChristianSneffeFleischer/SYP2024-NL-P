Martin Dubravka has been recalled from his Manchester United loan spell by parent club Newcastle.  The 33-year-old joined the Red Devils on loan at the start of the season with Erik ten Hag in need of backup to David De Gea. Newcastle were happy to let him replace Dean Henderson at Old Trafford - he joined Nottingham Forest on loan - with Nick Pope their first-choice goalkeeper and Loris Karius and Karl Darlow in reserve.  Since then, the Slovakia international has made two appearances for Man Utd, starting in their Carabao Cup matches against Aston Villa and Burnley, keeping a clean sheet in the latter game. He won't add to that tally though as Newcastle have opted to recall him with immediate effect, ending his loan spell early.   "We would like to thank Martin for his contribution during his time with our club, and wish him all the best for the future," a Man Utd statement said.
