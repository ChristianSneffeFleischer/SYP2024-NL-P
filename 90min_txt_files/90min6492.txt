Arthur is set to undergo a medical on Sunday ahead of his proposed move to Juventus, as part of a cash-plus-player deal involving Miralem Pjanic. The Italian giants recently agreed an    80m fee with Barcelona for the midfielder, while Juventus midfielder Pjanic is valued at around    65-70m. The final hurdle to getting the deal done was Arthur's approval of the move, but the midfielder has now agreed a deal 'in principle' with Juventus.  The move could be finalised in the coming days, with Br  jula del Deporte stating that the 23-year-old's move is expected to be officially announced on either Monday or Tuesday. He is in the Barcelona squad to play Celta Vigo on Saturday. Furthermore, Arthur is said to be 'very touched' emotionally, and 'surprised' by the lack of affection shown by his coach Quique Setien in recent days.  As for Pjanic, Juventus boss Sarri has now explained that he 'doesn't know' where the midfielder's future lies, but insisted that he will be a part of the team until at least the end of August and he hopes he will stay beyond then, as well.   "I don't know if Pjanic will no longer play with Juventus, I have not received any communication," Sarri told Sky Sport Italia (via Goal) after his side's 4-0 win over Lecce on Friday evening.
