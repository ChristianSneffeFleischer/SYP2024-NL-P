La Liga will ease transfer restrictions on Spanish clubs in the summer market, allowing teams to spend a little more freely this window. Strict financial regulations have been enforced over the last few years and La Liga clubs have been unable to make as many lavish signings as other sides across Europe. Barcelona were notably hit hard by these restrictions when they were forced to let Lionel Messi leave on a free transfer in 2021 as they could not register his new contract under new guidelines. However, MARCA report that La Liga are ready to ease these restrictions this summer. La Liga sides must ensure that the total cost of their squad does not exceed 70% of the club's total income. Teams currently over that salary limit are currently only allowed to spend 40% of money saved or accrued in player sales, but this figure will rise to 50%. This will then increase to 60% if the player accounts for 5% of the total value of the first-team squad. feed While this should allow the likes of Barcelona, who have been seriously hampered by financial woes recently, a little more room for manoeuvre in the transfer market, these rule changes are unlikely to help them immediately and they must still sell players in order to seriously benefit from them. Other sides such as Real Betis and Almeria - who 90min understands could sell star striker El Bilal Toure to Atalanta - have been hit hardest by La Liga's regulations of late and like Barcelona still need to bring in funds through player trading. Real Madrid, meanwhile, have still been able to spend lavish sums on players, recently signing Jude Bellingham from Borussia Dortmund for an initial    103m.
