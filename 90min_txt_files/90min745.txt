Chelsea have rejected a second offer from Manchester United for Mason Mount, sources have confirmed to 90min. United launched their opening offer for Mount last week, but that bid worth  £40m was rejected. Now, a second bid worth  £50m has also been quickly rebuffed by Chelsea. The second offer was worth an initial  £45m with  £5m in add-ons, but that is still way short of Chelsea's valuation of Mount. Chelsea had initially demanded  £70m for Mount, although sources close to the situation believe that they could be ready to drop to between  £60m and  £65m. That would still require United to raise their offer by at least another  £10m, however. 90min understands that United boss Erik ten Hag is pushing his superiors hard to get a deal finalised for Mount, who he now sees as a hugely important part of their plans ahead of the new season. feed Despite the second bid being rejected quickly, the lines of communication between the two clubs remain open and a third offer is expected shortly. Chelsea had always hoped that Mount could yet be persuaded to extend his contract beyond its current expiry date of 2024, but even the appointment of Mauricio Pochettino as head coach has failed to lead to a breakthrough. It is believed that Chelsea are now accepting that there is too much 'bad blood' between the club and Mount's camp for him to commit to a new deal.
