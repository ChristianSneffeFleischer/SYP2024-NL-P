Barcelona midfielder Frenkie de Jong has commented on reports that he could leave the club to join Manchester United. The Dutchman was heavily pursued by the Red Devils last summer, with incoming manager Erik ten Hag making him a priority transfer target. Despite Barcelona's requirement to raise funds in order to financially compete - which included the activation of several economic 'levers' - as well as a still-unfulfilled need to pay De Jong millions in deferred wages, he ended up staying at Camp Nou and has since turned into a pivotal member of Xavi's preferred starting lineup. READ NEXT manual De Jong has long insisted that he has no intention of leaving Barcelona, though he was recently quizzed directly about interest from England, with Ziggo Sport asking: "You won   t join Manchester United in the summer, correct?" To this, De Jong replied: "No, I don't think so. You never know of course. But I'm very happy in Barcelona." 90min understands that De Jong is still wanted by Ten Hag and United are prepared to make another move should an opportune scenario arrive. De Jong's Barcelona were eliminated from the UEFA Europa League in the knockout round play-offs by United, who advanced following a 4-3 aggregate win. Ten Hag's side have since reached the quarter-finals, where they will meet another La Liga outfit in Sevilla. Barcelona, meanwhile, moved 12 points clear at the top of La Liga after beating rivals Real Madrid 2-1 in El Clasico on Sunday night, with De Jong in line to win the Spanish title for the first time since joining from Ajax.
