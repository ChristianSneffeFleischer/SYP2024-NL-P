Renato Sanches' loan move to Wolves is in serious doubt with the two clubs some way apart in their valuation of the player. Sanches helped Lille secure a shock Ligue 1 title last season and has been linked with a whole host of teams over the course of the summer. No move had ever seemed close until Wolves entered the race, though.  Wolves had hoped to complete a deal before Tuesday's deadline and things looked promising over the weekend. However, according to various reports, an impasse has now been reached. As per Tim Spiers, Wolves have not given up hope of striking a deal but will only re-enter talks if Lille make concessions.  The main sticking point is the insertion of an option-to-buy clause. Lille want this fee to be considerably more than the  Â£20m they paid for the midfielder back in 2019 and Wolves are currently unwilling to acquiesce to their demands. The deal is not dead but there remains plenty of work to do with the deadline looming.   Wolves want at least one more player through the door before the end of the day having already completed deals for Francisco Trincao, Jose Sa, Yerson Mosquer and Bendeguz Bolla this summer. Most recently, Hee-chan Hwang has arrived on loan from RB Leipzig after struggling to force his way into the team last season.
