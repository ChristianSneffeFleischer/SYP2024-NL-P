Atletico Madrid supporters displayed an anti-Cristiano Ronaldo banner during Wednesday's 4-0 friendly victory over Numancia. Thomas Lemar, Angel Correa, Geoffrey Kondogbia and Matheus Cunha all netted during the comprehensive win, but it was the Atleti fans who caught the eye as they sent a direct message to the club's owners. Ronaldo has been loosely linked with a move to Atletico Madrid as he searches for an exit from Manchester United, though club president Enrique Cerezo recently shut down rumours of a transfer. He said: "I don   t know who invented this story about Cristiano Ronaldo to Atletico Madrid. "It   s not true. It   s practically impossible for him to come to Atletico Madrid." Atleti fans then showed their distain towards Ronaldo with a banner that read 'CR7 NOT WELCOME' against Numancia. Ronaldo has been a constant scourge of Atleti throughout his career, scoring iconic hat tricks against them in the Champions League for both Real Madrid and Juventus.
