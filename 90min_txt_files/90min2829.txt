Cesar Azpilicueta has confessed that he did consider leaving Chelsea for Barcelona but felt a duty to be loyal to the Blues in the wake of their takeover this summer. The club captain saw an automatic one-year extension triggered in his contract last season to prevent him becoming a free agent, but talks remained on with Barcelona over a possible transfer to La Liga. Chelsea had been open to granting Azpilicueta an exit as a show of respect for his ten years of service, although manager Thomas Tuchel was always adamant he wanted the 32-year-old to stay. He eventually got his wish as Azpilicueta inked a new two-year contract. On his rollercoaster of a summer, the defender told the Standard:    Yes, the conversations were there [with Barcelona], all around the club.    After the Club World Cup, where I became the only player to ever win every trophy, [I felt] it was the time to go back to Spain. But then everything happened with this club. I wanted to stay committed. I never did anything against my club. We had private conversations where I said everything.    I have never been in a transfer market situation in 10 years. It was different. The last time was Marseille and this time the contract situation made it different because I had this clause [to extend my deal] after a number of games.    For a period I was a free agent and who knows what could have happened then? I decided to stay silent because there was already enough noise around me. I didn   t want to make it worse because I wanted to stay focused on my game.

Winning that Club World Cup - the only piece of silverware missing from Azpilicueta's CV at the time - was a huge moment for Azpilicueta and one which prompted significant reflection about the future.    It was a turning point,    he acknowledged.    I tried so hard to win this trophy. At that moment I felt differently. At that moment it was like,    wow, I have won everything for this club   , so maybe a new chapter arrives. It   s true that at the last break my performances were not as good as before.
