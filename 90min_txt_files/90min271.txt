Galatasaray are confident of securing the signature of Wilfried Zaha, sources have confirmed to 90min. Zaha is currently a free after his deal with Crystal Palace expired at the end of June, although he has continued to use the club's training facilities in recent weeks. In a bid to keep hold of the Ivorian international's services, Palace have also offered him the largest contract in the club's history believed to be worth around  Â£200,000 per week. Despite this, Zaha has been exploring his options all summer and has received lucrative offers from Saudi Arabia and Qatar, but the player is keen to stay in Europe due to harbouring ambitions of playing in the UEFA Champions League.  feed Despite spending time at Manchester United, the wide player has never played in Europe's elite competition - something which is believed to be a long-held career ambition.  Now 90min understands that Zaha is in talks to signed for a club who have qualified for the 2023/24 Champions League in Super Lig title-holders Galatasaray.  Sources have confirmed that the Turkish club are 'confident' of agreeing terms with Zaha, who has previously rejected contract offers from both Lazio and Marseille in recent weeks. Fabrizio Romano has also reported that the player could be due to sign a three-year deal at Galatasaray.
