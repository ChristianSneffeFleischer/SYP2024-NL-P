Barcelona will attempt to sign Olympique Lyonnais striker Ada Hegerberg for a world record  £420,000 fee this summer. Hegerberg, who has spent nine seasons with OL and has cemented her status as one of the game's greatest ever players. Spanish outlet Marca report that she is now Bar  a's number-one target this summer. Barcelona are said to be keen to wrap up a deal before the start of the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand, which kicks off on 20 July. With 238 goals in 213 games for Lyon, Hegerberg is considered one of the most complete strikers in the world, and the Bar  a board believe that she possesses skills that the club's current forwards don't have. If Barcelona are successful, the transfer would exceed the  £352,000 they paid to Manchester City for England midfielder Keira Walsh last summer.
