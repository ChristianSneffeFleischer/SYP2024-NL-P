Former Chelsea and Arsenal winger Willian has confirmed he is leaving Corinthians and heading back to London with his family. The 34-year-old left the Emirates in August 2021 to sign an 18-month contract with Corinthians, but his return to Brazil quickly soured as fans began to turn on him for his return of just one goal in 44 games for the club. Manager Vitor Pereira recently confessed that he was unsure what the future held for Willian, who has been linked with a return to Premier League newcomers Fulham, and the veteran winger has now confirmed he is leaving Brazil. "I give up everything I have to receive," he told ESPN in reference to his contract and salary. He added: "I know my performance wasn't what I expected, but I've never been a player to score 20 or 30 goals a season."
