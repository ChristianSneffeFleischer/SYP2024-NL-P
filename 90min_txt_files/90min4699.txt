After five seasons and a boatload of great memories, Gini Wijnaldum is no longer a Liverpool player, leaving a near-irreplaceable void both as a player and owner of the Premier League's best smile. With the ever-present midfielder no longer, well, present, here's a look at the realistic replacements Liverpool could be looking at this summer, given budget constraints, strategy and availability. Age: 23Value:  £20-30mPros: Similar profile to Wijnaldum Cons: Previous struggles in the Premier LeagueAfter an underwhelming first spell in English football with Swansea back in 2017/18, Renato Sanches has rebuilt his career with Lille where he won the Ligue 1 title in 2021.Once dubbed a future superstar, the Portugal international's game has developed hugely since his failed Premier League stint, and his technical ability on the ball along with his energy and work rate mean he could be a solid replacement for Wijnaldum with real long-term potential. Age: 27Value:  £35-50mPros: Versatile, just finished best ever season for goal contributionsCons: Slightly older than a typical FSG signing, expensivePiotr Zielinski looked to be heading for Merseyside back in 2016, only for Napoli to swoop in late on and convince the Poland international to remain in Italy.The 27-year-old is noted for his ability to carry the ball from deep - something which may appeal to Jurgen Klopp with Naby Keita struggling to adapt to life in England.Zielinski signed a new deal with Napoli just last year, meaning would will be forced to dig deep into their pockets if they really wanted to secure the services of the midfielder.  Age: 24Value:  £35-45mPros: Versatile, box-to-box operator Cons: Deadline for release clause has passed, Bayern Munich interestFlorian Neuhaus has been a fixture in the Borussia Monchengladbach starting XI for a number of seasons now, and at just 24 years of age he's attracting interest from a number of top clubs.Already with three caps for Germany to his name, Neuhaus' best attributes are his sublime passing ability and his nous in and around the final third.The Monchengladbach man's rate of progression in recent seasons has been incredible, and he could prove to be an exciting project if that's the avenue Klopp looks to explore.Liverpool were heavily linked earlier in the year, but reports claim the expiry of a release (supposedly around    40m) at the end of May caused them to rethink their plans.  Age: 24Value:  £40-50mPros: One of the Premier League's best defensive midfieldersCons: ExpensiveBrighton have pretty much done the hard work when it comes to helping Yves Bissouma settle into English football.The former Lille man struggled initially following his move from Ligue 1, but he's really started to flourish this season and has become an integral part of Graham Potter's side.The Mali international won't offer as much going forward as Wijnaldum, but his combative style of play could help release the shackles of some of Liverpool's other midfielders.No Premier League midfielder made more tackles in 2020/21 (104) than Bissouma. Age: 27Value:  £15-20mPros: Last year of contract, good relationship with Red BullCons: Slightly older than most FSG signingsMarcel Sabitzer was rumoured to be on Tottenham's wish list during the January transfer window, and you can guarantee other clubs will be interested this summer.The Austria international enjoyed another fine campaign having notched nine goals in all competitions as RB Leipzig captain last season.Some reports in Germany have even suggested Sabitzer could leave on the cheap with his contract just one year from expiry. Age: 23Value:  £15-25mPros: Real goalscoring threat, perfect age bracketCons: Dealing with Lyon, unproven outside of FranceCourted by Arsenal last summer, Houssem Aouar is young, talented and has bags of potential.The 23-year-old is far from an exact fit in terms of looking for a direct Wijnaldum replacement, though his ability to run with the ball and make an impact in the final third mean Klopp may well be tempted to add something different to his midfield.Aouar is likely to attract interest from a whole host of clubs this summer, and with Lyon in need of cash, it could be a smart move - even if it means bringing up memories of the Nabil Fekir saga. Age: 24Value:  £25mPros: Goalscoring threat, all-action midfielder, one year left on contractCons: Potentially high wage demands, may prefer to stay in ItalyThe Ivorian midfielder enjoyed his most impressive season to date with Milan in 2020/21, scoring 13 times as the Rossoneri secured Champions League qualification.His drive from midfield could add a new dimension to Liverpool, while his contract situation means he will never be more attainable.Reports suggest he is looking for north of  £100k a week to stay in Milan, which remains his preference. Age: 26Value:  £30-40mPros: Hugely experienced at highest level, versatile, Cons: form has waned in recent years, expensive wagesA Steven Gerrard fanatic as a boy,   iguez to Liverpool rumours initially made a lot of sense when they first arose.The midfielder is still only 26, but has more top-level experience than most and can play in just about any position needed across the midfield.However, the reason he is available is because Atleti have watched his form dip in the last year, while he would demand wages to match Liverpool highest earners.
