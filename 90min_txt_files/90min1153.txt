Napoli have accepted that they may have to sell star defender Kim Min-jae this summer despite long insisting that he will stay at the club, 90min understands. The South Korea international has announced himself as one of the world's leading centre-backs since his move to Serie A from Fenerbahce last summer, and is known to be of interest to Manchester United, Liverpool and a number of other leading clubs. The 26-year-old has played a key role in helping Napoli win their first Scudetto since 1990, and the Partenopei have spent much of the year trying to tie Kim and winger Khvicha Kvaratskhelia down to new and improved deals, believing that striker Victor Osimhen would be the only high-profile departure in the summer. While a contract extension is not off the table and they are reluctant to part ways, sources have told 90min that Napoli would find it hard to knock back bids for Kim in excess of    60m amid increasing interest. feed Kim's current deal contains a release clause worth around    45m which sources believe is active for the first two weeks of the summer transfer window, but an up-front payment of that amount is difficult for any side to action because of Financial Fair Play regulations. 90min understands that Manchester United are in the market for a right-footed centre-back and had representatives at Napoli's 1-0 win over Fiorentina at the weekend. Ajax's Jurrien Timber and Benfica's Antonio Silva are also on their radar. Chelsea, Liverpool and Tottenham were also at the Stadio Diego Maradona on Sunday and are long-term admirers of Kim - Spurs notably made a play for him when he was at Beijing Guoan in 2020. Paris Saint-Germain have kept eyes on Kim too, though with Milan Skriniar arriving on a free transfer from Inter this summer, another centre-back is not seen as a priority for them right now.
