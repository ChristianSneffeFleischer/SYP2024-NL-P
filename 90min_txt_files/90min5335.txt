Crystal Palace are planning to offer a new long-term deal to Andros Townsend, amid fears he could leave the club for free next summer. Townsend has played over 150 games for the Eagles since joining from Newcastle in 2016, but the Englishman's five-year deal is drawing to a close. While the 29-year-old has started the campaign brightly for Roy Hodgson's side - contributing a goal and two assists across six league games - there has been no movement on a new contract to date, opening up the possibility of a cut-price exit in January or move next year for nothing. With Townsend's future still yet to be resolved, the Mirror (via HITC) claim that Eagles boss Roy Hodgson is eager to offer him a new long-term contract to alleviate those concerns. Palace's Premier League rivals West Brom are known to be admirers of Townsend, with manager Slaven Bilic understood to have been keen on securing a move last summer. A move did not come to fruition at the time, but Kamil Grosicki's proposed loan move to Nottingham Forest - which is subject to arbitration - could open up a slot in the Baggies' 25-man Premier League squad, leading to a potential January bid. Palace have been impressive in the Premier League to date, and Townsend's form during that run has been steady enough. He has drawn the ire of Hodgson though off the field, with the veteran England boss skeptical towards the winger's decision to join talkSPORT as a regular contributor on their breakfast show.
