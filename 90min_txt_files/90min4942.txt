Real Madrid outcast Luka Jovic is close to securing a loan back to former club Eintracht Frankfurt. Jovic made a name for himself at the German side during the 2018/19 season, scoring 27 times in 48 appearances and also registering seven assists. That form was enough to convince Real to sign him for over  Â£50m that summer. Since arriving at Santiago Bernabeu he has massively underwhelmed, managing just two goals in 32 appearances, as well as experiencing a number of problems off the pitch. As reported by Serbian media outlet Republika (via Marca), Jovic's Real nightmare could be over soon with Frankfurt set to take their former star back on loan until the end of the season. The deal is said to be 'practically closed', though there are a few minor details to finalise before it goes ahead.  It is also understood that there will be no option to buy clause negotiated. Frankfurt's sporting director Fredi Bobic has gone as far to say the deal is done, pending a medical.

His imminent exit suggests Real may have given up on him and their interest in Kylian Mbappe is well known. However, if he does depart, it will leave Los Blancos short of genuine alternatives for Karim Benzema.
