Leicester City manager Brendan Rodgers has insisted the club aren't thinking about selling Youri Tielemans in January. The 25-year-old has been linked with a number of big clubs in the past year, none more so than Arsenal, and is out of contract at the end of the season. Recent reports have suggested Mikel Arteta's Gunners could reignite their interest in Tielemans and look to sign him on a free transfer next summer, rather than making a move for him in January. With Tielemans non-committal over his future, Leicester have to decide whether or not they want to tie and cash in on the Belgian midfielder in when the transfer window opens - but if Rodgers' latest comments are anything to go by, he's not planning on losing the in-form midfielder anytime soon. Scott Saunders  hosts  Graeme Bailey  and  Toby Cudworth  in the latest episode of Talking Transfers. The team discuss Cristiano Ronaldo's Man Utd future, interest in Naby Keita and a decision looming for Harry Kane. Available on  all audio platforms.

We don   t want to be offloading our best players, that   s for sure," Rodgers said post-match after the 1-0 defeat to Manchester City.  "So there has been no hint or indication we need to generate money and move him on. But, of course, there   s a business side to the club that they will look at. "We had a number of long chats in the summer. There is clearly no doubt even a young guy who is focused like Youri and very professional, it can have an impact. But he has been fully focused. He doesn   t let that affect him. He is a top-class professional, he sees the game how I see it.
