Manchester United believe that they have won the race to sign Christian Eriksen following the expiration of his Brentford contract, 90min understands. The Dane signed for the Bees on a six-month deal back in January and played a huge role in helping them to a mid-table finish in their maiden Premier League season. Eriksen had told Brentford he would be leaving last month, only to then remain open to the possibility of extending his stay in west London. Former club Tottenham were also looking into re-signing him and were confident of concluding a deal had they followed up on their interest, but chose not to. Crystal Palace, Newcastle and West Ham were all in touch too. And 90min understands Manchester United believe the 30-year-old is heading to Old Trafford following fresh talks over the weekend. Personal terms on a three-year deal have not yet been agreed but are not believed to be an issue. Erik ten Hag's personal involvement helped persuade Eriksen to join, and he has been impressed by their plans for this summer and the future.  The Red Devils have long held an interest in Eriksen, who spurned a move to Old Trafford in 2019 when he asked to leave Spurs for a fresh challenge. But the 20-time champions of England are closing in on their man. Listen now to 90min's Talking Transfers podcast, with  Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey,  Harry Symeou  &  Toby Cudworth. On the latest show they discuss Richarlison's move to Tottenham, where Lisandro Martinez could be heading and more. Available on  all audio platforms  and the  90min YouTube channel.
