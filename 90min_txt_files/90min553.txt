Manchester United have been offered the chance to rival Atletico Madrid for Fiorentina midfielder Sofyan Amrabat, sources have told 90min. The 26-year-old shot to global fame as one of Morocco's best players in their run to the semi-finals at the 2022 World Cup. He then played a starring role as Fiorentina reached the finals of the Coppa Italia and Europa Conference League, though ultimately fell short of glory in both competitions. Amrabat has been heavily linked with a move away from La Viola even before his exploits over the last few months and he is likely to leave this transfer window. 90min understands that Atletico Madrid are confident of finalising a deal for him, though crucially have not agreed a fee with Fiorentina. Man Utd have now been offered the chance make a play for Amrabat, who is available for a modest  £30m. The Red Devils are considering their options but it remains to be seen if they will prioritise a move for another midfielder, with Mason Mount's initial  £55m move from Chelsea to be confirmed shortly. feed Liverpool tried to sign Amrabat back in January and are also being kept informed of his situation, though they have not followed up on their interest recently. The Reds have brought in two attacking midfielders so far this summer in Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai. Barcelona made an audacious loan offer for Amrabat midway through the 2022/23 season which was knocked back by Fiorentina, while Tottenham came close to signing him in January 2022 before bringing in Rodrigo Bentancur and Dejan Kulusevski from Juventus instead. Fiorentina CEO Joe Barone confirmed earlier this week that the club will listen to offers for Amrabat, but have not yet received any. "We have not received any bid or proposal for him at all. He's Fiorentina player now. If an offer comes, we will consider it," he said.
