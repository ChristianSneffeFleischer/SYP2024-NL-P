Bayern Munich have confirmed the signing of former Stoke and Paris Saint-Germain striker Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting on a short-term contract until the summer of 2021. Choupo-Moting has been without a club since leaving PSG in August, with his last appearance actually the 2020 Champions League against Bayern in Lisbon.  #ServusChoupo ? FC Bayern sign Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting! ?       #MiaSanMia #packmas @mr.choupo A post shared by  FC Bayern Mu  nchen (@fcbayern) on Oct 5, 2020 at 6:45am PDT The 31-year-old Cameroon international was born in Germany and started his career with Hamburg, before later playing for Nurnberg, Mainz and Schalke. Following a disappointing season with Stoke in 2017/18 that ended in relegation, Choupo-Moting   s switch to PSG soon afterwards was surprising enough. With only nine goals in 51 appearances under his belt, a move to Bayern now comes as an even greater shock. But the player himself is revelling in the opportunity to play for another huge club.    It's a great feeling to come back to the Bundesliga - and then to the biggest club in Germany,    he told his new club   s official website.    Who wouldn't want to play for FC Bayern?  It's an honor to play for this club.  At FC Bayern, the aim is always to win everything, and I am highly motivated to achieve these goals.    Sporting director Hasan Salihamidzic added,    I am happy that we were able to sign Eric.  He gives our squad a depth on the offensive, especially in the centre, which we will need.
