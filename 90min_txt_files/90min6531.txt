SHOP NOW: Get the latest Borussia Dortmund gear from Puma! The 16-year-old has exploded onto the scene at Birmingham this season, and has already made 36 senior appearances, despite the fact he is not eligible for professional terms until his 17th birthday on June 29. United and Dortmund had emerged as the two main contenders for his signature, though reports have also thrown Chelsea in the mix in recent days. Sources have informed 90min in recent months that United have been confident of securing his signature. The club showed the player and his family around their Carrington training complex in a bid to secure the signing, though Dortmund have been doing their own work on the transfer themselves in the mean time. ESPN in Germany now report that a decision has been made, with Dortmund the beneficiaries. Their track record in developing young players - the likes of Jadon Sancho, who could leave the club for United this summer, and Erling Haaland among them - could have played its part in Bellingham's choice.  Solid point.
