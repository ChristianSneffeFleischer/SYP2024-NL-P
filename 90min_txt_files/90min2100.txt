Xavi Hernandez says he is not expecting Barcelona to be active in the January transfer market, but that is his choice. Barcelona have had a lot of financial difficulties in recent times, and a Champions League exit at the group stage will not have helped the balance sheet either. However, Xavi says there was never going to be much transfer activity on the agenda anyway, because he is extremely happy with the existing Barca squad. Speaking ahead of the transfer market, Xavi told BarcaTV:    I told [Mateu] Alemany not to do too much, that I   m happy with my family, a very sensational squad.     We don   t know if we will be able to bring in new players. I think we can be competitive. If we can   t make signings, I   d be happy.
