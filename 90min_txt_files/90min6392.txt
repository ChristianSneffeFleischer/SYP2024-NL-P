Carlos Tevez is no stranger to transfer sagas, just ask West Ham, Sheffield United, Manchester City or Manchester United fans. He's also 36 years old and, most likely, well past his best. But that hasn't stopped the rumour mill suggesting that an epic move back to the Hammers is on the cards, despite reported interest from MLS and the possibility of signing a new Boca deal. Tevez first arrived at West Ham in 2006 alongside fellow Argentine Javier Mascherano in a third-party ownership deal. He scored seven goals and assisted five in 27 appearances for the Hammers, before being sold to Manchester United just one year later. His most recent career move was a return to Boca Juniors - for a third time - in 2018, but he's now heading towards the end of his contract and is, depending if you believe reports in Argentina, on the verge of moving onto pastures new. El Intransigente note that if Tevez returns to Europe, West Ham are among his most likely destinations - citing his iconic standing among the club's fanbase as a potential reason to go back. The same publication have also suggested that a move to MLS franchise Minnesota United could be on the horizon. If that wasn't complicated enough for you, Marca Argentina report that Tevez may not be going anywhere - claiming that he's verbally agreed to extend his contract with Boca for another season, with optional six-month extension.
