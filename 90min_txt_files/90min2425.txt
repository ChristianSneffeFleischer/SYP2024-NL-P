Barcelona are thought to still owe as much as    144m on various incoming transfers from years     including    50m on Miralem Pjanic and Philippe Coutinho alone, both of whom have actually left Camp Nou in permanent deals. Bar  a made Coutinho one of the most expensive players of all time when they agreed a deal with Liverpool in 2018 worth up to    160m. But things quickly soured for the Brazilian and he spent time on loan at Bayern Munich and Aston Villa, before joining the latter for a minimal fee this year. Pjanic, meanwhile, was part of a slightly bizarre double deal in the summer of 2020 that saw the Catalans also send Arthur Melo to Juventus. AS has reported that Bar  a   s latest economic report, which is to be presented to members next months, will explain that the club has outstanding transfer fees to be paid totalling    144m. However, they are also owed just under    130m themselves, with plenty of modern deals arranged with staggered payment structures. Aside from money still owed for Pjanic (   36m) and Coutinho (   14m), Bar  a have    46m to pay Ajax for Frenkie de Jong and Sergino Dest. There is another    52m that has to go to Manchester City for Ferran Torres. Yet Bar  a are yet to be paid    10m for Coutinho by Aston Villa and will also receive    6m for Trincao from Wolves in due course.
