Manchester United midfielder Marcel Sabitzer has admitted he is yet to speak with Bayern Munich or Thomas Tuchel over his future as his loan at Old Trafford nears the end. Sabitzer joined United on a short-term deal until the end of the season in January, providing additional cover to a midfield that had recently lost Christian Eriksen to injury. The Austrian has made a decent impact across his 17 appearances in all competitions so far and, even though Eriksen has since returned to fitness, 90min has already recently revealed that manager Erik ten Hag is keen to make Sabitzer   s deal a permanent one. But the 29-year-old has revealed he is yet to speak to his parent club about the situation.    Of course, there hasn   t been any contact up until now, because they have a lot going on and so do we,    Sabitzer has told Sky Sports Germany.    Everyone is focused on their tasks. We   ll discuss and analyse everything calmly and see in which direction it   ll go.    feed Things have changed at Bayern since Sabitzer left Munich in January. He was out of favour under Julian Nagelsmann, who has since been replaced by the aforementioned Tuchel. However, 90min understands things with regard to his status at the Allianz Arena are unlikely to be much different. Bayern are not expected to stand in the way of a permanent transfer and would sell for a fee similar to the    16m ( £14.2m) they paid RB Leipzig in the summer of 2021. Other clubs are interested in Sabitzer, but he has settled at United and they are his first choice. United   s ideal situation ahead of next season is to sell a midfielder not in the club   s long-term plans     Scott McTominay, valued at  £30m, or Fred     and buy Sabitzer while still in overall net profit. There are then also ambitions to sign a new starting    number eight   .
