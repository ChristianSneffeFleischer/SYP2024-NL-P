The MLS transfer window is now closed, with clubs ready to go in search of glory in the latter half of the season. For some, the summer window has been all about keeping hold of their best talent to help with a playoff push, while others have allowed their young stars to make the switch to Europe, seeing them off like proud parents. A few transfers not announced on the night may still make it over the line, while those from other leagues are still free to approach MLS clubs to poach some more players - given how much interest scouts now show in MLS, this feels more like a case of if, rather than when. To help you make sense of all the comings and goings in Major League soccer, here is every single confirmed transfer from the secondary window: A post shared by Atlanta United FC (@atlutd) In Amar Sejdic - CF Montreal - $100k - Details Luiz Araujo - LOSC Lille - $12m Out Fernando Meza - Necaxa - Free transfer A post shared by Austin FC (@austinfc) In Sebastian Driussi - Zenit Saint Petersburg - Undisclosed - Details Moussa Djitte - Grenoble - Undisclosed Orrin McKinze Gains II - Hannover 96 II - Free transfer A post shared by Chicago Fire FC (@chicagofire) Out Przemyslaw Frankowski - Lens - $3m - Details Alex Monis - Forward Madison - Loan Javier Casas - Forward Madison - Loan A post shared by FC Cincinnati (@fccincinnati) In Florian Valot - New York Red Bulls - $50k Out Jurgen Locadia - Brighton - End of loan Franko Kovacevic - Hoffenheim II - End of loan A post shared by Colorado Rapids (@coloradorapids) In Mark-Anthony Kaye - LAFC - $1m Dominique Badji - Nashville SC - $50k Out Sam Vines - Royal Antwerp - $2m - Details Nicolas Benezet - Seattle Sounders - $50k In Erik Hurtado - CF Montreal - $200k - Details A post shared by FC Dallas :) (@fcdallas) Out Tanner Tessmann - Venezia - Undisclosed - Details Thomas Roberts - SK Austria Klagenfurt - loan In Out A post shared by Houston Dynamo FC (@houstondynamo) In Teenage Hadebe - Yeni Malatyaspor - Undisclosed Corey Baird - LAFC - $750k - Details Adalberto Carrasquilla - FC Cartagena - Loan Griffin Dorsey - Unattached - Free transfer Out Christian Ramirez - Aberdeen - Undisclosed - Details Jose Bizama - Charlotte Independence - Loan Kyle Morton - Memphis 901 - Loan A post shared by LA Galaxy (@lagalaxy) In Dejan Joveljic - Eintracht Frankfurt - Undisclosed Out Giancarlo Gonzalez - Alajuelense - Loan A post shared by Los Angeles Football Club (@lafc) In Cristian Arango - Millonarios - Undisclosed - Details Brian Rodriguez - Almeria - End of loan Out Mark-Anthony Kaye - Colorado Rapids - $1m Corey Baird - Houston Dynamo - $750k A post shared by Minnesota United FC (@mnufc) Out Foster Langsdorf - Retired Ike Opara - Released A post shared by Inter Miami CF (@intermiamicf) In Kieran Gibbs - West Brom - Free transfer - Details Nick Marsman - Feyenoord - Free transfer  Ventura Alvarado - San Luis - Free transfer - Details Indiana Vassilev - Aston Villa - Loan - Details Out Matias Pellegrini - Estudiantes - Loan - Details Josh Penn - Charleston Battery - Loan In Robert Orri Thorkelsson - Breidablik - Undisclosed Out Erik Hurtado - Columbus Crew - $200k Amar Sejdic - Atlanta United - $100k Luis Binks - Bologna - End of loan A post shared by Nashville Soccer Club (@nashvillesc) In Ake Loba - Monterrey - $6.8m Out Dominique Badji - Colorado Rapids - $50k Tom Judge - Pittsburgh Riverhounds - Loan Out Jacob Montes - Crystal Palace - Undisclosed In Out In Lucas Monzon - Danubio FC - Loan Out Florian Valot - FC Cincinnati - $50k David Jensen - KVC Westerlo - Loan A post shared by Orlando City SC (@orlandocitysc) In Emmanuel Mas - Boca Juniors - Free transfer - Details Out Matheus Aias - Real Oviedo - Loan Derek Dodson - Hartford Athletic - Loan A post shared by Philadelphia Union (@philaunion) In Jesus Bueno - Deportivo Lara - Undisclosed Matheus Davo - Corinthians - Loan Out Matej Oravec - Podbrezova - Loan A post shared by Portland Timbers (@timbersfc) In George Fochive - Bnei Yehuda - Free transfer Santiago Moreno - CD America - Undisclosed Out  Jeremy Ebobisse - San Jose earthquakes - $1.17m - Details In Toni Datkovic - Aris Saloniki - Undisclosed - Details Out A post shared by San Jose Earthquakes (@sjearthquakes) In Jeremy Ebobisse - Portland Timbers - $1.17m Nathan - FC Zurich - Undisclosed A post shared by Seattle Sounders FC (@soundersfc) In Leo Chu - Gremio - $3m Nicolas Benezet - Colorado Rapids - $50k Out Alfonso Ocampo-Chavez - Saalfelden - Loan A post shared by Sporting Kansas City (@sportingkc) In Jose Mauri - CA Talleres - Free transfer - Details Out Tyler Freeman - Karlruher SC - Loan Gianluca Busio - Venezia - Undisclosed - Details Out Rocco Romeo - Valour FC - Loan A post shared by Vancouver Whitecaps FC (@whitecapsfc) In Pedro Vite - Independiente - Undisclosed Ryan Gauld - Farense - Undisclosed - Details Out
