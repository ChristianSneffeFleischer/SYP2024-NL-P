Paris Saint-Germain have completed the signing of Benfica and Portugal striker Goncalo Ramos. The 22-year-old forward, who scored a hat-trick against Switzerland in the last 16 of the 2022 World Cup, joins on loan until the end of the season when PSG will have the option to make it a permanent deal. Benfica had hoped for a fee in the region of  Â£69m for Ramos, who previously attracted interest from Manchester United. He told the club's website: "I'm very proud and happy to join Paris Saint-Germain. PSG are one of the biggest clubs in the world with one of the best squads." Ramos scored 19 goals in 30 Primeira Liga appearances last season as Benfica won their 38th Portuguese top-flight title. feed With the future of Kylian Mbappe anything but certain, PSG have moved in the summer market to secure new goal threats. While Lionel Messi has departed, the likes of Marco Asensio, Xavi Simons, Lucas Hernandez and Manuel Ugarte have arrived at Parc des Prices in recent weeks. The signings are expected to continue, with Barcelona winger Ousmane Dembele closing in on a    43m to the Ligue 1 champions. PSG also retain an interest in Joao Felix, who spent the second half of last season on loan at Chelsea, while talks with Eintracht Frankfurt for striker Randal Kolo Muani quickened over the weekend.
