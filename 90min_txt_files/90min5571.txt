Manchester United have reached an agreement with Alex Telles over personal terms but remain in discussions with Porto over a transfer fee for the left back. United have been linked with Telles for the last few weeks. However, the two clubs appears to be at an impasse over the player's price tag - a recurring issue for United in recent times. Transfer reporter Fabrizio Romano claimed on Twitter that only agent fees and final details are waiting to be ironed out with the 27-year-old and his representatives. He also confirmed that talks are on for Telles' transfer, but shed no light on how close the two clubs are on agreeing a price.  Instead, United do still have a 'plan B' lined up should the deal fall through, which suggests that the Red Devils aren't going to cave into a price tag they don't feel is fair. United missed out on Sergio Reguilon despite having agreed personal terms, as they didn't want to meet Real Madrid's demands with regards to inserting a buyback clause into his contract - a deal that Tottenham ultimately agreed to. Romano has insisted that United are looking to do more business before the 5 October deadline, with a left back the priority alongside a right winger, namely Jadon Sancho. There's still no progress on the situation between United and Borussia Dortmund, with the German club sticking true to their    120m ( Â£108m) asking price. Manchester United priority: left back and right winger. Possible also a CB. Tonight #MUFC have been in contact again with Alex Telles agents. He will push to leave Porto on next few days. Man Utd are monitoring and considering an opening bid. There   s also another option as LB. ? https://t.co/PYVtS8GKbR
