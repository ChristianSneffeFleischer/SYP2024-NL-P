New England Revolution full-back DeJuan Jones says he's "excited" by the rumours linking him with a move to the Bundesliga. The 24-year-old has become a staple of Bruce Arena's side since being picked up in the 2019 MLS SuperDraft, making 60 appearances during that time and providing the Revs with real attacking thrust down the left flank. So impressive has his form been that, according to SBI, Jones is now attracting interest from a pair of clubs from the German top flight, as well as sides from Belgium and Greece. Jones put in another stellar performance as the Revs beat the Philadelphia Union 2-1 on Sunday night to extend their unbeaten run to six games. No player made more tackles (five) or won more aerial duels (four) on the night than Jones, while the full-back also contributed in the final third, creating two chances. Asked about rumours linking him with a departure to Europe, Jones spoke of his "excitement" and admitted crossing the Atlantic is an ambition of his.    Yeah, I think it's great," he told reporters. "It's obviously one of my goals to get over to Europe someday and play, or play [for] the national team. So, to get those looks is really exciting and I know I have a lot of work to do. So just for now, I'm just focusing on continuing to get better every day and winning games for the Revs.    Jones is one of two widemen who could seemingly leave the Revs in the near future, with Tajon Buchanan reportedly close to sealing a $7m switch to Club Brugge following his impressive exploits at the Gold Cup, where he helped Canada reach the semi-final for the first time since 2007.
