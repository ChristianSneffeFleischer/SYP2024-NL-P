Xherdan Shaqiri has agreed personal terms ahead of his potential move to Lyon, but the two clubs have not yet negotiated a transfer fee. Shaqiri was a bit-part player at Liverpool last season, making just 14 Premier League appearances and failing to score. He was used even more sparingly during the 2019/20 campaign, contributing very little to the Reds    title charge.   Shaqiri is in the final year of his contract and has been linked with a move away from the club in recent times. Lyon and Lazio have been mentioned as possible destinations over the past few weeks and according to L   Equipe, the former have moved ahead in the race for his signature. The Ligue 1 side are said to have already hammered out personal terms with Shaqiri. He is expected to earn just under    90,000 per week for three years at Lyon, as the club look to replace the creativity and goals of Memphis Depay. Depay joined Barcelona following the expiration of his contract at the end of the season and will be a tough act to follow. If Shaqiri does sign, he will become Lyon   s highest earner. All that is required now is an agreement between the two clubs over his transfer fee. Liverpool value Shaqiri at around  £13m and Lyon have come nowhere close to offering this so far. They have already had a  £3.4m bid turned down by the Reds and are preparing a second offer for him imminently.
