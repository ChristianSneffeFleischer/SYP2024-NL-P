Paris Saint-Germain have made a late push to sign Hakim Ziyech from Chelsea ahead of Tuesday's transfer deadline, sources have told 90min. The Moroccan has consistently been linked with an exit from Stamford Bridge this month, though his on-pitch performances have improved in the last few weeks. He has recently been the subject of interest from Newcastle United and Everton, though he now looks set to leave England altogether. 90min understands that PSG are confident of agreeing a loan deal for Ziyech prior to Tuesday's 11pm deadline. Italian champions Milan, who have been touted with an interest in Ziyech for months, also emerged as a late contender for his signature, but it is more likely that he will be heading to the French capital instead. Ziyech signed for Chelsea in the summer of 2020 from Ajax and helped them win the Champions League in his debut season. There are plenty of Chelsea players who could leave before the end of the window, with the likes of Conor Gallagher and Ruben Loftus-Cheek also in the shop window. 90min revealed on Monday that the Blues have also agreed a British record fee in order to sign top target Enzo Fernandez from Benfica.
