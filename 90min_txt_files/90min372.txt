PSV Eindhoven have confirmed Xavi Simons has left their training camp to close in on a return to Paris Saint-Germain. The Netherlands international first joined PSG in 2019 after leaving Barcelona before departing for PSV in 2022. A buy-back clause worth around    10m and    12m was included in the deal and PSG have now activated it. A statement from PSV, who came second in the 2022/23 Eredivisie, reads: "Xavi Simons immediately leaves the training camp to complete the transfer with Paris Saint Germain.  The twenty-year-old attacker came to PSV last year and became an important player in Ruud van Nistelrooy's team." feed Simons netted 19 league goals last season alongside eight assists and made his debut for the Dutch national team in 2022, featuring once at the World Cup during a knockout stage victory over the United States. He featured 11 times in total for PSG the first time around but will be a more prominent squad member once the transfer goes through. Luis Enrique is the new manager in charge at Parc des Princes and is having to navigate a typically chaotic transfer window with the futures of Kylian Mbappe and Neymar up in the air. However, strong signings in the form of Milan Skriniar, Marco Asensio, Manuel Ugarte, Lee Kang-in and Lucas Hernandez have been made to bolster the Spaniard's squad. Enrique was in charge at Barcelona from 2014 to 2017, when Simons was a youth prospect at Camp Nou gaining legions on followers on Instagram.
