Tijjani Reijnders has admitted that Xavi tried to convince him to join Barcelona this summer, but the call came too late as he had already agreed to join Milan. The Rossoneri are reinvesting the money made through the sale of Sandro Tonali to Newcastle United, bringing in six senior players since the opening of the transfer window. Christian Pulisic and Ruben Loftus-Cheek have joined from Chelsea, while Marco Sportiello and Luka Romero have completed free transfers from Atalanta and Lazio respectively. Noah Okafor recently seal his move from Red Bull Salzburg, joining Reijnders following his arrival from AZ Alkmaar. Speaking to Gazzetta dello Sport, the Dutchman revealed that he was the subject of a late approach from Barcelona, but he had committed to Milan and so pushed ahead with a move to San Siro. feed "Xavi called me to discuss possible move to Barcelona," Reijnders said. "It was impossible for me - no way, as I already decided to join AC Milan. "I had made my choice. I had spoken to [Geoffrey] Moncada and [Stefano] Pioli, and at that point I had already made up my mind, including with my family. I had already decided that I would play for Milan." While Reijnders spurned Barcelona's advances, the Spanish champions have made three signings so far this summer. Ilkay Gundogan decided to leave Manchester City and head to Catalonia on a free transfer, as did Athletic Club defender Inigo Martinez. La Masia graduate Oriol Romeu completed his return to Barcelona from Girona last week.
