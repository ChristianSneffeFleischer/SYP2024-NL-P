Manchester United have announced the signing of Andre Onana from Inter. Onana has signed a five-year contract with an option for a further year at Old Trafford, and will replace long-term number one goalkeeper David de Gea, who recently left United on a free transfer.

Speaking to United's club channels, Onana said: "To join Manchester United is an incredible honour and I have worked hard all my life to get to this moment, overcoming many obstacles along the way. Walking out at Old Trafford to defend our goal and contribute to the team will be another amazing experience. This is the start of a new journey for me, with new teammates, and new ambitions to fight for. "Manchester United has a long history of incredible goalkeepers, and I will now give everything to create my own legacy in the coming years. I am excited by the opportunity to work again with Erik ten Hag, and I can't wait to play my part in the success I know he is determined to deliver at this great football club." feed Football director John Murtough added: "Andre was our top choice to become the new goalkeeper for Manchester United, with exactly the right profile of technical attributes and personality. Having achieved success throughout his career, we know that Andre will further add to the winning mentality we are building within our squad. "He is already one of the world   s best goalkeepers and at the age of 27 we firmly believe that he can develop even further over the coming years."
