Champions League finalists Manchester City and Chelsea are among the teams vying for Robert Lewandowski's signature this summer. The Bayern Munich striker is said to be undecided with regards to his future after spending seven seasons at the Bavarian club, winning everything on offer in the German game. Reports recently emerged that Lewandowski was attracting the interest of several unnamed European clubs, and according to ESPN, Premier League duo City and Chelsea are keeping an eye on the Poland international's situation. Chelsea and Man City have emerged as contenders to sign Robert Lewandowski this summer, sources have told ESPN, with the striker undecided on his future. pic.twitter.com/JuDFTKXVPV The 32-year-old still has a couple of years to run on his contract with the Bundesliga champions, but a move away from the Allianz Arena prior to the summer of 2023 appears to be a real possibility. Lewandowski recently returned from injury after a spell on the sidelines which saw him miss the club's Champions League quarter-final aggregate defeat to Paris Saint-Germain. There's never been any doubt regarding the player's quality, but his absence during that European tie in particular shone a light on how important he is to Bayern. It's interesting that the two clubs linked have been playing without a recognised striker as of late, with Kevin De Bruyne starting up top for City and Kai Havertz for Chelsea. With Sergio Aguero set to leave the Etihad Stadium this summer, you can understand why City would be chasing a direct replacement up top. 90min previously reported of their interest in Borussia Dortmund's Erling Haaland.
