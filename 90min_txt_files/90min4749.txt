Real Madrid are considering a move for Villarreal defender Pau Torres as a potential replacement for Sergio Ramos, should the long-serving captain depart the Bernabeu in the summer. Ramos' contract expires at the end of the 2020/21 season and although negotiations over extending his current deal have been rumbling on for some time, with the club requiring the defender to take a pay cut, an exit this summer is beginning to look likely. The World Cup winner has spent the last 16 years of his career at the Bernabeu after joining from Sevilla in 2005, and his departure would leave a substantial void for Real to fill. The Spanish champions have reportedly already identified Braga defender David Carmo as a potential successor to Ramos, and according to Goal, Villarreal's Torres is another on their list. The Spain international is under 'close observation' from Real, but the club face a drawn out negotiations with Villarreal if they are to agree a fee for the centre back. Torres has a    50m release clause, but has since seen his value rise to    65m following his international debut in November 2019. The 24-year-old has gone on to make seven appearances for Spain's senior side. Real are 'hopeful' that they can utilise the strong relationship they enjoy with Villarreal to negotiate this price down, given a fee of    65m would be the most the club has ever spent on a defender.
