Exclusive - RB Leipzig are considering a move for Brighton and Hove Albion winger Solly Match, after his impressive start to the 2020/21 season. March has been a regular fixture for the Seagulls ever since their promotion to the Premier League back in 2017. Last season, however, the 26-year-old only made 19 appearances in Graeme Potter's side as a result of fitness problems and shaky form.  March has bounced back this campaign, seriously impressing in a left-wing back role and a source has told 90min that his fine form has attracted the attention of RB Leipzig.  Leipzig boss Julian Nagelsmann has shown a willingness to use wing backs in the past and the Englishman could also slot into midfield.  Die Roten Bullen have been tracking the player for some time and are now ready to make an offer ahead of the 5 October deadline.  Leipzig have been fairly active in the transfer market so far. They moved quickly to replace the departing Timo Werner, securing deals for Red Bull Salzburg front man Hee-chan Hwang and Crystal Palace flop Alexander Sorloth.   Nagelsmann's side have started the season fairly well, securing an opening day 3-0 victory over Mainz before securing a goalless draw away at Bayer Leverkusen.
