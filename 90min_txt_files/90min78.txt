Bayern Munich have agreed a  £86.4m (   100m) fee with Tottenham Hotspur for the transfer of Harry Kane, sources have confirmed to 90min. The German champions have been relentless in their pursuit of the striker, first revealing a public interest in him in July 2022. 90min has extensively reported that Bayern have been confident of agreeing a deal to pry Kane away from Spurs, despite the north Londoners' insistence he would not be sold. Bayern have seen three bids rejected by Tottenham already this summer, but a fourth worth a club-record  £86.4m (   100m) has been accepted. manual Kane has been open to both joining Bayern and remaining at Spurs at least until the end of his contract in 2024. 90min reported earlier this week that Kane wanted his future resolved before the start of the Premier League season this weekend and he will now have to choose between making the immediate move to Munich or staying at Tottenham. Should Kane opt to leave, Spurs could ramp up their interest in a new striker. 90min understands club representatives have spoken to the likes of Gent's Gift Orban, Lille's Jonathan David, Montpellier's Elye Wahi and Fulham's Aleksandar Mitrovic over potential moves.
