Paris Saint-Germain coach Christophe Galtier has confirmed the imminent signing of Portugal midfielder Renato Sanches from fellow Ligue 1 side Lille. After a 2016 transfer to Bayern Munich worth up to    80m with add-ons eventually turned sour, Sanches has resurrected his career since first joining Lille 2019. The Euro 20216 winner helped Lille break PSG   s domestic dominance in 2021 and claim their first French league title in 10 years. Now, after another strong season in 2021/22 after initially overcoming a hamstring injury, he appears ready for another go at a big name club. PSG are thought to have agreed a    15m for Sanches, now 24, which is actually less than Lille paid when he became their most expensive player ever. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  &  Sean Walsh  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Chelsea's plans to sign Marc Cucurella and Wesley Fofana.

Speaking about the deal on Thursday, which has not yet been announced by the club, Galtier told the media at a press conference:    He's coming this afternoon.    Renato has qualities that others in our squad don't have. He's a very explosive player, hard-hitting, with impact. There was this opportunity in the market to take a very high level player, who knows the French championship.    He will have to integrate, he arrives late. He has played little in pre-season. He will be late compared to his teammates. But he is different in his ability to break lines and recover balls.
