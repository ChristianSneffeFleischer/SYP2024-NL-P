RB Leipzig are said to be planning a move for Red Bull Salzburg's Patson Daka. The striker has been in outstanding form this season having scored an impressive 24 goals in 24 Austrian Bundesliga appearances - making him the league's top scorer.  Both Julian Nagelsmann and Dayot Upamecano are headed for Bayern Munich this summer meaning Die Roten Bullen have funds to reinvest. Nagelsmann will replace Hansi Flick at the Allianz Arena and Leipzig stand to receive up to  £21m for the 33-year-old's move to FC Hollywood.  Upamecano's transfer to Bayern is said to be worth  £38m and so while the club are in need of a rebuild, they have plenty of funds with which to do it. Jesse Marsch, formerly Ralf Rangnick's assistant at Leipzig has been appointed to take over the managerial hot seat and he could be about to bring Daka with him. The forward was signed from Zambian football back in 2017 and since moving to his current employers he has scored 65 goals in 120 appearances.  Bild reported RB Leipzig's interest in Daka earlier this month and Transfermarkt have now picked up the story - adding further credence to it.
