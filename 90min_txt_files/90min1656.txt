Chelsea are preparing to put Enzo Fernandez through a medical in Portugal as they continue to negotiate with Benfica over a potential blockbuster transfer, 90min understands. A broad agreement on a fee has been reached but the two clubs remain at loggerheads over the instalment plan, with the Blues trying to avoid triggering his    120m release clause which would have to be paid in its entirety up front. Blues officials have travelled to Portugal for crunch negotiations and, in anticipation of a final agreement which has not yet been reached, have made arrangements for Fernandez to undergo a medical in his homeland. Benfica have granted permission for Fernandez to head for a medical with Chelsea officials, which would allow the Premier League side to rush the completion of a transfer later in the evening if a final agreement can be reached. Personal terms were agreed with Fernandez's representatives earlier in the window when Chelsea made their first push for the Argentina international and so would not pose a problem either. Listen now as  Scott Saunders  hosts  Graeme Bailey  and  Toby Cudworth  to discuss why Joao Cancelo looks set to join Bayern Munich on loan from Man City, Arsenal's ongoing pursuit of Moises Caicedo & the futures of Pedro Porro, Enzo Fernandez, Youri Tielemans and more.
