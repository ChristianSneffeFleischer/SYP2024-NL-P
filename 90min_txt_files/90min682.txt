Arsenal midfielder Jorginho has dropped a massive hint that his former Chelsea teammate Kai Havertz will soon complete a move to the Gunners. 90min understands that the two rivals have agreed a fee that will see the Germany forward move from west London to north London. The transfer is expected to be finalised in the next few days, and Jorginho - who made the same journey from Stamford Bridge to the Emirates Stadium back in January - has stirred the pot with a cryptic post on social media. Jorginho and Havertz are among a number of Chelsea players past and present who are at the wedding of Kepa Arrizabalaga, with the likes of Manchester City-bound Mateo Kovacic and Barcelona's Andreas Christensen also guests. But Jorginho notably took the time to take a selfie with Havertz alone, posting it to his Instagram story alongside laughing face and eye emojis.

Bayern Munich then showed a willingness to step up their interest in a player they have long admired, but Havertz is now set to join Arsenal instead. Havertz will leave Chelsea best remembered for scoring the winner in the 2021 UEFA Champions League final, but underwhelming for the most part across his three-year spell.
