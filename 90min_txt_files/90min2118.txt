Chelsea target David Datro Fofana said only a few months ago that playing for the Blues is in his    heart   , with a video re-surfacing online in which he discussed his great hope for the future. Fofana will turn 20 later this month but has already won a league title, with his 15 goals in 24 appearances a big reason behind Mode   s recent Eliteserien title in Norway. The young Ivorian striker is considered one of the brightest young talents currently playing in Europe and has caught the attention of Chelsea and others. As 90min reported on Thursday, Fofana has been watched by multiple Premier League clubs. Brighton, Brentford and Leicester have been keeping an eye on him, but it is Chelsea who have emerged as the frontrunner to land his signature. In a clip that was recorded around six months ago but has now surfaced on social media, Fofana said, "Chelsea. I don't know why, but I want to play for Chelsea. "They're a very good team. It's in my heart." The Blues have overtaken Brighton, who had previously thought they were close to a deal. A crucial development in the transfer chase was the move of Brighton recruitment analyst Kyle Macaulay to Chelsea, following Graham Potter to Stamford Bridge after he made the same move. Macaulay had been responsible for identifying Fofana as a target for Brighton and has taken that with him in his new job at Chelsea.
