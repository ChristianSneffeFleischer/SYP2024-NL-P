Portugal star Goncalo Ramos was the subject of heavy interest from several clubs across Europe this summer but ended up staying at Benfica, 90min understands. Ramos instantly thrust himself into the global limelight when he was announced as Cristiano Ronaldo's replacement in the starting lineup to face Switzerland in the last 16 of the World Cup on Tuesday. And the 21-year-old, who had played just three times in brief cameos for the Selecao prior to this start, enjoyed a perfect match. He scored a memorable hat-trick - becoming the youngest player to do so in a World Cup knockout match since Pele - and helped lead a fluid Portugal attack in a thumping 6-1 win. Ramos' talent has been evident since breaking into Benfica's first team a couple of years ago, and 90min understands plenty of clubs were eyeing moves for him back in the summer. The side closest to completing the signing of Ramos were Newcastle United, who held initial talks for the forward but instead chose to pursue Alexander Isak.
