Manchester United turned down the chance to sign Wolves star Pedro Neto following a trial at Carrington in 2016. The 20-year-old signed for Wolves in 2019 and has since blossomed into one of the most exciting young wingers in the Premier League, but was actually on the radar of the Red Devils before his ascent.

His performances this season have prompted interest from Manchester City, while United are also likely to target a winger in the summer. United - then managed by fellow Portuguese native Jose Mourinho - passed up on signing the teenager, however, and Neto returned to Braga following his assessment in Manchester. It only took a year for Neto to develop and he soon began to impress with Braga at youth and senior level. This caught United's eye once more as Mourinho began to receive intel on Neto, prompting the Red Devils to reignite their interest. A move never materialised, though, and Neto instead moved to Lazio in August 2017. He failed to hit his stride there, but continued to impress for Portugal at youth level. That form prompted a move to Wolves in 2019 in a  Â£16.1m deal, facilitated by notorious super agent Jorge Mendes - who has become key in bringing Portuguese talent to Molineux.
