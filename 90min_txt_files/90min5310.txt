Following a busy summer transfer window in terms of incomings, Chelsea are poised to continue their spending spree in January with the club keen on Malmo centre-back Anel Ahmedhodzic. The west Londoners set about mitigating their defensive woes in the summer by bringing in veteran free agent Thiago Silva and Rennes shot stopper Edouard Mendy, both of whom have proved hits thus far.  But further defensive reinforcements could be on their way, with Swedish news outlet Expressen reporting that the Blues have been tracking the progress of 21-year-old defender Ahmedhodzic, who was once of Nottingham Forest. The report notes that the English giants are attempting to bring in a talented youngster at centre-back in the next window for around  Â£7.2m, before loaning them out in typical Chelsea fashion. The Blues brought in free agent Malang Sarr - another 21-year-old centre-back - in the summer before loaning him out to Porto for the 2020/21 campaign.  Ahmedhodzic has emerged as a fine talent playing for current Swedish Allsvenskan leaders Malmo. The 21-year-old rose through the ranks at the Swedish club before making the move to Forest at 16. However, he made just one appearance in three years for the English club as he returned to Malmo following an impressive loan spell in Denmark with Hobro IK. Ahmedhodzic has since gone on to shine at his boyhood club, making 24 appearances this term, with his evolution helping him to two senior caps for the Bosnia and Herzegovina national team after switching allegiances from Sweden.
