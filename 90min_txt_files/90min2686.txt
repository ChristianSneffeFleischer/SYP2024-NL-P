Bernardo Silva has vowed to give his all for Manchester City this season, despite interest in his services from Barcelona. Barcelona, despite their financial woes, are desperate to lure Silva over to Camp Nou but City are also desperate to keep him around, with manager Pep Guardiola regularly admitting he wants Silva to stay at the Etihad Stadium. Amid all the uncertainty behind the scenes, Silva has looked comfortable on the pitch this season. He was handed his first start in Sunday's rollercoaster 3-3 draw with Newcastle and played a starring role, racking up a goal and an assist, after which he insisted he is loving life at City. "We're only in the third match of the season, it's not worth thinking too much about these things," he told Eleven Sports about his future. "I'm happy here, it's a club that loves me and that I love. "I will always give my best for this club and this year will be the same."
