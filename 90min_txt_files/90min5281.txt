Paris Saint-Germain forward Neymar has told officials at the French club that he is ready to put pen to paper on a new contract at the Parc des Princes. The 28-year-old's current contract is set to expire in the summer of 2022, and his initial reluctance to agree an extension has led to countless insufferable rumours of a potential return to Barcelona over the last few years. It had been thought that Neymar was keen to leave France and seal a return to Camp Nou, but the narrative has changed somewhat in recent weeks. Firstly, Foot Mercato reported that Neymar spoke directly with PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi during the Champions League tournament in Lisbon at the end of last season to let him know he wants to stay in Paris. Neymar is said to have offered himself on a five-year contract at the same salary as he currently earns, and talks between the two parties are moving slowly. Telefoot's Julien Maynard has said something similar, although Maynard's claim is that Neymar spoke indirectly to director Leonardo about his long-term vision for the club, offering to stay and suggesting potential transfer targets for the club. What both stories have in common is that there is yet to be a formal offer on the table. PSG are understood to be prioritising a new deal for Neymar's partner-in-crime, Kylian Mbappe, whose deal also expires in 2022. Of the two, it is Mbappe whose future seems most in doubt. The 21-year-old has distanced himself from contract negotiations, with Real Madrid watching on in delight as they hope to land the Frenchman next summer.
