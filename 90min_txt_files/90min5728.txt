Exclusive - West Ham are interested in signing Brighton winger Solly March this summer, and have opened negotiations with the Seagulls over a transfer.  March has made more than 200 appearances for Brighton, and though he had to fight for his place in Graham Potter's team last season, he became an important player towards the end of the campaign. His performances have earned him plenty of interest - Newcastle, Everton and Wolves are all monitoring his situation.  A source has indicated to 90min, however, that it's the Irons who have taken the initiative, having opened talks with Brighton over a potential move.          A post shared by  Solomon March (@sollymarch) on Jul 17, 2020 at 7:11am PDT The south coast side, who are tipped for a big season after a strong finish to 2019/20, are prepared to sell the 26-year-old, who they picked up as a teenager from local non-league side Eastbourne Borough. Since joining their academy in 2011, he has made almost 200 appearances, helping them advance from the Championship and establish themselves in the top flight.  March, who was capped three times for England under-21s, is keen to move on after almost a decade at the Amex Stadium, feeling he can realise his ambition of becoming a full international under Gareth Southgate at a new club.
