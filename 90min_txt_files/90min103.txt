Liverpool legend and Al Ettifaq manager Steven Gerrard has admitted he does not want to see Mohamed Salah follow him to Saudi Arabia. The Reds have already lost two key players to Saudi Arabia this summer, with Fabinho joining Al Ittihad and captain Jordan Henderson linking back up with Gerrard at Al Ettifaq, and Saudi officials are understood to be keen to sign Salah. Fortunately for Liverpool fans, Salah's agent has already publicly shot down the rumours, insisting the Egyptian does not want to leave Anfield this summer. That stance will have gone down well with Gerrard, who recently confessed that he would rather see Salah fire Liverpool to more success before making a move to the Middle East. feed Asked by Sada Al Mala   eb if he would want to sign Salah, Gerrard responded: "No! No, no - the answer is no, because Mohamed Salah is my favourite player, I love Liverpool Football Club, so Mohamed can stay where he is. "When he wins more leagues and more Champions Leagues with Liverpool, we'll maybe consider it." Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp recently urged FIFA to look at reducing the length of the Saudi transfer window, which runs until 20 September - 19 days after the European window slams shut. "The influence of Saudi Arabia is massive at the moment," Klopp said. "Pretty much the worst thing is that the transfer window in Saudi Arabia is open three weeks longer. If I am right, I heard something like that, then at least in Europe that   s not helpful. "UEFA or FIFA must find solutions for that. It   s already influential for us but we will have to learn to deal with it."
