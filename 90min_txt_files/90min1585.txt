Teams throughout MLS are busy strengthening their rosters ahead of the 2023 MLS season, with players coming and going and big names linked. Here's the latest news you may have missed: The LA Galaxy have strengthened their defensive options with the re-signing of center-back of Eriq Zavaleta.Zavaleta has penned a new deal through the 2024 MLS season having played six times for the Galaxy across all competitions in 2022.The 30-year-old's previous deal expired at the end of last season but he'll continue on as a valuable depth piece alongside the likes of S  ga Coulibaly, Mart  n C  ceres, and Chris Mavinga.Prior to his time with the Galaxy, Zavaleta enjoyed spells with the Seattle Sounders, Chivas USA, and Toronto FC. While the Galaxy have tied down Zavaleta, they've allowed Carlos Harvey to leave in search of more first-team opportunities. The 23-year-old midfielder played just 10 times across three seasons with the Galaxy between 2020 and 2022, with the bulk of his minutes coming in the USL Championship with LA Galaxy II.Harvey will continue on at that level, joining Phoenix Rising in a deal that sees the Galaxy retain a sell-on percentage.   We   d like to thank Carlos for his time and contributions with the Galaxy and we wish him the best as he continues his career with Phoenix,    Galaxy head coach and sporting director Greg Vanney said in a club press release.
