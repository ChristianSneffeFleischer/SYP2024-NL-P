Bayern Munich star Alphonso Davies has revealed how Barcelona turned down the opportunity to sign him prior to his move to the Bundesliga.  Davies joined Bayern for a then-record fee for an MLS player of $22m, joining from Vancouver Whitecaps in January 2019.  Since them, the Canadian international has become one of the best full-backs in the world, winning five Bundesliga titles, two DFB-Pokals and one UEFA Champions League during his time with the Bavarian club.  Speaking on podcast 'Say Less', Davies has revealed that he could have made a move to Catalunya instead of Bavaria afer leaving MLS footballer, saying that Barcelona approached him but ultimately then-president Josep Bartomeu renegged on the deal because of the player's nationality:  feed    Barcelona approached me but the president [Josep Bartomeu] didn   t want me because I   m from Canada. This was what the press said, I don   t know if the President really said that, but I   m not going to lie, it kind of crushed my feelings.    La Blaugrana are currently in the market for a full-back after the mutual termination of Jordi Alba's contract at the end of the 2022/23 season.  90min understands that the club are monitoring Joao Cancelo's situation at Manchester City and Bayern Munich. While Bayern are keen to keep hold of the Portuguese international, they are unwilling to pay anywhere near their    70m option to buy the player this summer thus potentially paving the way for Barca to swoop in and secure his services.
