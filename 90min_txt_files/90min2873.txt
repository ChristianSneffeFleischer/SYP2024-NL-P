Cesar Azpilicueta will sign a new two-year contract with Chelsea, having previously been keen on a summer switch to Barcelona. 90min revealed as recently as late July that Barcelona remained confident of signing Azpilicueta. Chelsea had triggered an extension option in his contract but there was a gentleman   s agreement between player and club that he would be allowed to leave for a small fee. Azpilicueta, who arrived at Chelsea from Marseille in 2012 and has won nine major trophies including two Premier League titles and the Champions League, was impressed by Barcelona   s offer of a long-term contract and felt ready for a new challenge. But the arrival of new owner Todd Boehly appears to have had an influence on proceedings as the American businessman was keen to let Thomas Tuchel have final say on Azpilicueta   s future. It has now been confirmed to 90min that the player will commit the next two years to Chelsea. That deal to 2024 will take Azpilicueta to verge of his 35th birthday and 12 years of service.
