Chelsea have another new forward in their ranks as Mykhaylo Mudryk has sealed his    100m move to Stamford Bridge. The Ukraine starlet was a top target for Arsenal but has been convinced to move to the blue side of London instead, adding some much-needed firepower to a forward line that has been struggling all season. Here are a few ways Graham Potter could use his new man. Mudryk is primarily a left winger and will largely dominate that position from this point onwards, so it's a case of who fits alongside him. In the short term, with most of Chelsea's heavy hitters injured, Potter doesn't have a whole lot of flexibility in his forward line. The easiest option would be to put Mudryk on the left side of a forward line which includes Joao Felix (when not suspended) and Kai Havertz, who would likely play on the right. Felix's arrival adds to the number of expensive attackers at Potter's disposal, which may make a 4-2-3-1 formation the best way to go. Mudryk, again, takes the spot on the left wing but he'd be ask to rotate with the rest of Chelsea's fluid front four, including the likes of Felix, Havertz and Hakim Ziyech. Mason Mount, Raheem Sterling and Christian Pulisic are all looking for minutes here as well, giving Potter a bit of a headache. Chelsea have already got another expensive forward coming to Stamford Bridge in the summer, with Christopher Nkunku set to join from RB Leipzig.
