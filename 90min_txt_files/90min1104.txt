Real Madrid winger Vinicius Junior has no plans to quit the Bernabeu, despite falling victim to yet more racist abuse during Sunday   s trip to Valencia, 90min understands. Vinicius has established himself as one of the most dynamic attackers in the world over the past couple of years. He scored 22 goals in all competitions for Real last season, earning him a 2022 Ballon d'Or nomination, and has eclipsed that with 23 this season. But the Brazilian has repeatedly been targeted with racist chanting and abuse over the course of the campaign. The incident at the Mestalla over the weekend was just the latest episode. Vinicius has openly criticised La Liga's response to the various incidents this season and has claimed in the wake of the Valencia game that 'racism is normal' within the competition. "The championship that once belonged to Ronaldinho, Ronaldo, Cristiano [Ronaldo] and [Lionel] Messi today belongs to racists," he said, adding that his native Brazil now considers Spain 'a country of racists' as a result. feed But the 22-year-old does not intend to let racism drive him out of La Liga. 90min has learned from Real Madrid sources that the club is furious with the ongoing problem. They are firmly backing Vinicius and are determined to fight La Liga or anyone else to get justice for him. Vinicius himself is not seeking to leave and remains happy at Real. His relationship with coach Carlo Ancelotti, who is under contract until at least the end of next season is also a main reason why the player is keen to continue in the Spanish capital. Ancelotti has helped Vinicius unlock his potential since returning to the club in 2021, overseeing the player's transformation from talented youngster to decisive game-changer.
