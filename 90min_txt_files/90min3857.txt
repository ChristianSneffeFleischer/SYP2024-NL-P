Zenit St Petersburg striker Sardar Azmoun has revealed the club turned down an offer for his services from Tottenham in the summer. The 26-year-old was highly sought-after having netted 19 times in 29 appearances last season - including four times in the Champions League. Azmoun has started the new campaign in equally fine fettle, rattling home six goals in seven appearances so far. The Iran international already has 37 goals in 52 caps for his country, although he has some way to go to match former world record-holder and compatriot Ali Daei's total of 109. The forward has revealed that those goalscoring exploits drew interest from across Europe in the summer and he was open to a move away, but was denied a switch by Zenit with his contract not due to expire until 2022. Speaking while on international duty with Iran, Azmoun revealed that Spurs were one of the clubs in for him before the transfer deadline - and confirmed that having entered the final 12 months of his deal, he will likely leave the Russian club for free next summer instead. "I have a contract," he said (as quoted by Calciomercato). "Even if I wanted to leave Zenit, the club can stop me and there is nothing I can do.  "I have had offers from Tottenham, Lyon, Leverkusen and Roma and they refused them. If I go away, I will do it this summer as a free agent." As has become the custom in recent transfer windows, Tottenham were looking for support up front for talismanic striker Harry Kane over the summer, and their search evidently led them to Zenit's Azmoun.
