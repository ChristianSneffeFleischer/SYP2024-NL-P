Bayern Munich have not given up hope of signing Harry Kane from Tottenham Hotspur this summer, sources have told 90min. The German champions have been embroiled in a public saga regarding the England captain since the summer of 2022 when manager Julian Nagelsmann first floated the idea of signing him. This prompted fury from Spurs head coach Antonio Conte, who called the Bavarians' pursuit 'disrespectful'. Senior figures at Bayern have not hidden their admiration in other interviews since. While reports in the German media have stated in recent months that Bayern felt their hopes of signing Kane were dwindling, 90min understands that he is very much still one of their main transfer targets. Kane's contract at Tottenham expires in the summer of 2024. Talks are ongoing over a potential new deal and Spurs are confident of their vice-captain signing on, but he is believed to be hugely frustrated with their recent dip in form having won just five of their last 12 Premier League games - a factor which could play a part in negotiations. Bayern recognise luring Kane to Germany could be difficult - he is on course to break Alan Shearer's all-time Premier League scoring record in the next few years - but the striker's camp have still not ruled out a move abroad. In terms of a potential transfer fee, Bayern are believed to value Kane in the same ballpark as Robert Lewandowski, who was sold to Barcelona last summer for a total package of    50m. Die Roten do recognise that Kane is younger and would cost a bit more as a result, however.
