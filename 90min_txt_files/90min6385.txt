Fenerbahce are keen to sign Manchester United attacking midfielder Juan Mata during the next transfer window, with an agreement said to be close.  With Mata, now 32, reaching the latter stages of his career, he has taken up a squad role in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side this season. The Spaniard has started 20 of his 34 appearances in 2019/20, but he has played just 19 minutes of league football since the resumption of play.  His current United deal is due to expire in 2021, but the Red Devils do have the option of extending this by a further year. But with Solskjaer looking to raise funds in order to land his first-choice targets in the upcoming transfer window, he will be looking to reduce the size of his current squad.  Sansursuz Futbol journalist Ahmet Ercanlar (via Sport Witness) has now reported that  Fenerbahce are keen on bringing in Mata, with an agreement said to be close. The club's president Ali Koc has been in touch with the agent of Luiz Gustavo, who is currently playing for Fener, about helping with the Mata deal.  Following Max Kruse's decision to terminate his contract in June, Fenerbahce are on the lookout for attacking reinforcements and they view Man Utd's number eight as their first-choice target. As for Mata himself, Ercanlar claims that he is eager to make the switch. Thank you @ChrisSmalling ?? https://t.co/89Y7JxDfLu
