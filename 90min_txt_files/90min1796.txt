Brighton head coach Roberto De Zerbi has admitted it could be difficult to keep hold of in-demand midfielder Moises Caicedo. 90min reported on Friday that Chelsea had seen an initial  £55m bid for the Ecuadorian knocked back, with former Seagull Yves Bissouma, now of Tottenham, also on their radar. Chelsea could yet return with another offer for Caicedo before the end of the January transfer window, and while De Zerbi is keen for the 21-year-old to stick around until the summer at least, he is aware that this may not be possible "Moises is very important for us," De Zerbi said at a press conference on Friday. "It is difficult to change with another player now at this stage. I hope he finishes the season with us, but it   s always difficult to be certain. When big teams want our players, it   s good news for the club. "The best solution is that he finishes the season with us and for him, in the summer, it   s better then if he changes teams. I don   t know if he will continue to play like this - the last games - it is possible he can leave for another team [in the summer]." Brighton have already lost one key player this window, with Leandro Trossard joining Arsenal on Friday for a deal that could be worth up to  £27m.
