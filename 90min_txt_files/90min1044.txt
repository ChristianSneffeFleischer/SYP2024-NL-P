Leeds United have accepted that they may have to sell Tyler Adams and Brenden Aaronson following their relegation to the Championship, sources have told 90min. The Whites' three-year stay back in the Premier League came to an end on Sunday with a limp 4-1 defeat at home to Tottenham Hotspur, bringing the curtain down on a miserable season. The campaign had begun with such promise, particularly after a 3-0 hammering of historic rivals Chelsea back in August demonstrated how Leeds could have progressed as a pressing team under Jesse Marsch, with summer signings Adams and Aaronson showcasing their worth. But Leeds failed to consistently perform and they were largely let down by defensive errors across the season, culminating in relegation. READ MORE FROM THE 90MIN TALKING TRANSFERS TEAM feed 90min understands that Adams and Aaronson are likely to leave just one year after heading to Yorkshire. The latter has a relegation release clause of around  Â£25m - the same amount Leeds paid to sign him from Red Bull Salzburg last summer - and is believed to have suitors in Germany. Adams, the captain of the USMNT, is wanted by a number of major clubs having impressed in his maiden Premier League campaign and at the 2022 FIFA World Cup. The 24-year-old is believed to be an option for Liverpool, Manchester United, Newcastle United and Tottenham, while he is also being tracked by clubs in Germany, Italy and Spain. However, the transfer fee that Leeds are likely to demand means he is likely to remain in England. Adams crucially missed Leeds' final 12 games of the Premier League season with a hamstring injury, failing to win any of their last nine on their way to relegation. Fellow American Weston McKennie will not return to Leeds following his half-season loan from Juventus. LISTEN NOW
