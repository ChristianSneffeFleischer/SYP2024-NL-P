Chelsea have agreed a deal to sign 15-year-old Independiente del Valle midfielder Kendry Paez, 90min understands. Paez is seen as one of South America's most exciting youngsters and is already a regular feature for the senior side, even scoring on his debut earlier this year. Clubs from across Europe have been following Paez with a view to signing him once he turns 18 in 2025, but Chelsea have moved aggressively to fend off competition by agreeing a deal which 90min understands could be worth up to    20m if all bonuses are met - a clear record for a player of his age. IDV general manager Santiago Morales recently revealed that the club were close to agreeing a deal to sell Paez to an unnamed club and sources have now confirmed that Chelsea have put the finishing touches on another huge youth transfer. READ NEXT manual Born in 2007, Paez is the latest sensation to come through the academy at Independiente del Valle. The young midfielder has shone at youth level for club and country, impressing with five assists and one goal in his first five appearances for Ecuador's Under-17 side, and scouts from across the globe have been thoroughly excited by what they have seen from the teenager. Paez is primarily an attacking midfielder but has featured regularly on the right wing. Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital have bought into Chelsea's 'Vision 2030' plan, spending huge sums of money on young talents in an attempt to build an elite first-team squad by the time 2030 arrives. Gabriel Slonina, Carney Chukwuemeka and Cesar Casadei have all been signed for huge fees with a view to making an impact on the senior team down the line, and Paez is another example of the sort of player Chelsea are looking to sign.
