Manchester City are poised to firm up their interest in RB Leipzig defender Josko Gvardiol this summer and make a move for the Croatia international, sources have told 90min. Gvardiol has emerged in recent months as one of the most highly-rated defenders in football following on from his performances at the 2022 World Cup. The left-footed centre-back  was close to joining Chelsea last summer, but the Blues failed to secure a deal with Leipzig. Chelsea do still hold an interest, yet without any European competition to offer 2023/24, they have little hope of persuading the player to move to Stamford Bridge. Gvardiol has a clause in his contract worth just shy of  Â£100m that is due to kick in from 2024. But, as 90min revealed earlier this year, Leipzig are ready to take less than the figure to facilitate a move. feed Gvardiol himself knows he will virtually have his pick of clubs when he decides to leave and 90min understands that, as it stands, his preferred options are Manchester City and Real Madrid. City will make room in their squad with the sale of Spain international Aymeric Laporte, who has made it known he is ready to move and amid interest from clubs including Aston Villa and Tottenham. It remains to be seen if Real Madrid will push to do a deal this summer. Like City, Los Blancos are huge fans of Gvardiol and have been following him closely, but they have other needs and it is believed they want a new left-back ahead of a left-sided centre-back at this time.
