Chelsea have triggered the release clause in the contract of Leeds United midfielder Tyler Adams, sources have confirmed to 90min. The Whites were relegated from the Premier League last season, activating a  £20m clause that allows Adams to leave Elland Road if a bidding club is prepared to pay in full. 90min revealed on Monday that Chelsea had contacted the representatives of Adams over a move to west London, and personal terms are now being discussed with the 24-year-old United States international. The Blues have also informed Leeds of their intention to pay Adams' release clause in full, and he is expected to undergo a medical within the next 24 hours. Adams is seen as a shrewd signing by those in charge at Stamford Bridge, who are working to provide manager Mauricio Pochettino with the midfield reinforcements he has publicly requested this summer. feed Chelsea are working on a number of midfield signings and recently launched a bid to rival Liverpool for Southampton midfielder Romeo Lavia, who has been on the Blues' radar for over 12 months now. After Liverpool saw a  £46m bid rejected for Lavia, Chelsea put forward an offer of  £48m, though that remains short of Southampton's  £50m asking price. Chelsea are also continuing to work on an agreement for Brighton midfielder Moises Caicedo, whose  £100m asking price has so far proven problematic. Liverpool have also made late contact with Brighton over potentially rivalling Chelsea's latest offer, which sat at  £80m, but have not progressed talks to the point of making a formal offer.
