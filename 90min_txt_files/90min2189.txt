West Ham United have agreed a deal to sign Sao Paulo's highly-rated centre-back Luizao, 90min understands. The 20-year-old has been monitored by a number of European clubs after breaking into Sao Paulo's side and is out of contract at the Brazilian giants at the end of January. Sao Paulo boss Rogerio Ceni recently admitted Luizao was "very likely to leave" and that his imminent departure would be a "painful process" for the club, and sources have confirmed to 90min that he has turned down two new contract offers. Benfica, Sporting, Porto, Fulham, Wolves, Juventus and the Red Bull group all put offers forward to Luizao, but 90min has learned a pre-contract agreement with West Ham has been signed and he'll be joining David Moyes' side on a three-and-a-half year contract.
