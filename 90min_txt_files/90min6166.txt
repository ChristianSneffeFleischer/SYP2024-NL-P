Manchester United and Manchester City have both submitted 'firm offers' to sign Angers' Rayan Ait-Nouri - who recently visited both Old Trafford and the Etihad Stadium. The 19-year-old is primarily a left-back, although he can operate further up the field too. Ait-Nouri made his debut for Angers back in August of 2018, but he cemented his place in the starting lineup during the 2019/20 campaign.  The Frenchman made 17 appearances in Ligue 1 before he fractured his jaw in January.         Rayan A  t Nouri prolonge !
