Javier Zanetti has revealed Inter held talks with Lionel Messi prior to the six-time Ballon d'Or winner trading Barcelona for Paris Saint-Germain. Messi brought his legendary time with La Blaugrana to an end in 2021 after scoring 672 goals in 778 appearances across all competitions, winning a host of La Liga and Champions League titles among countless other team and individual honours. The Argentine had to leave the Camp Nou due to Barca's financial struggles making them unable to offer a new contract. A number of different options were on the table for Messi at the time. PSG eventually won the race to become his second professional club, but not before Inter made their move.    I was surprised when he [Messi] left Barcelona. Realistically, we cannot compete with PSG or Premier League clubs, but due to our rapport, we spoke when there was a chance," Zanetti said of his compatriot.
