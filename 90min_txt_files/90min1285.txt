Barcelona's Robert Lewandowski has said that it would be amazing if Lionel Messi were to return to the Camp Nou next season. The legendary Argentine is unlikely to extend his contract at Paris Saint-Germain, sources have confirmed to 90min, and there's hope within Barcelona's hierarchy that a sensational return to Catalonia can be agreed. Messi's father, Jorge, has met with Barcelona officials over the last few weeks to discuss a potential return, with president Joan Laporta making it clear that Messi's homecoming would be welcomed with open arms. Contact has also been made by Saudi Arabian outfit Al-Hilal, the city rivals of Cristiano Ronaldo's Al Nassr, but the lucrative contract on offer to Messi is unlikely to persuade him and his family that a return to Barcelona isn't in his best interests. "If he comes back to Barcelona, it will not only be for the fans but for the players something amazing because his place is here in Barcelona," Lewandowski said, in quotes relayed by Spanish publication Sport. feed "I don't know what's going on... I hope that next season we can play together because I know that Leo is the guy who can do [create] something from nothing, and of course, we need those kinds of players, for sure. "For me, I say that Lionel Messi always belongs to Barcelona," he continued.
