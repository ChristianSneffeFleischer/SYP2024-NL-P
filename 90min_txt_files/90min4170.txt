Juventus are keen to secure the signing of Manuel Locatelli and will meet with Sassuolo next week to discuss a deal. The Italian has been courted by Arsenal in recent weeks as Mikel Arteta looks to strengthen his midfield ahead of the 2021/22 season, though Juve have also made no secret of their interest in the 23-year-old. The Gunners were recently reported to have matched Sassuolo's    40m ( Â£34.2m) valuation of Locatelli, and the move has only served to accelerate Juventus' pursuit, with Gazzetta dello Sport reporting that director of football Federico Cherubini will meet with Sassuolo chief Giovanni Carnevali after the Euro 2020 final to discuss a deal. The Old Lady have been told they will need to match Arsenal's offer if they're to stand any chance of landing the midfielder, a figure they're reportedly willing to pay despite their ongoing financial woes. Any other business they do this transfer window will rely on them generating cash from the sale of players before the club's hierarchy will sanction any new arrivals. Interest in Locatelli has only continued to grow following his showing at Euro 2020 this summer. The Sassuolo man played a starring role in Gli Azzurri's second win of the tournament as he bagged two impressive strikes to hand his side a 2-0 lead against Switzerland. His campaign very nearly ended on a sour note after Unai Simon saved his penalty in Italy's shootout with Spain in the semi-final, though the subsequent miss from Dani Olmo and Gianluigi Donnarumma's save from Alvaro Morata meant Locatelli's blushes were spared.
