Manchester United midfielder Hannibal Mejbri has joined Championship outfit Birmingham on loan for the 2022/23 season. Mejbri made his Red Devils debut on the final day of the 2020/21 season before appearing in two more Premier League defeats to Liverpool and Crystal Palace. The Tunisia international told Birmingham's website:    It is an honour to come and play for this club.    I have heard a lot of good things from my friends who have played here before, so I am ready to come and play for this club.    Mejbri is a former France youth international, having played for them at Under-16 and Under-17 level, but switched to Tunisia in 2016 and has since made 16 appearances at senior level. He is expected to be part of their squad for the World Cup in the winter. He departs Old Trafford temporarily with United set to add another star to their squad in the form of Antony.
