AFC Bournemouth have completed the signing of Argentina international Marcos Senesi from Feyenoord. The Cherries have been busy adding to their squad in the last week, completing deals for Middlesbrough winger Marcus Tavernier and Barcelona goalkeeper Neto. Ryan Fredericks and Joe Rothwell also joined on free transfers at the start of July. And Scott Parker's side have further bolstered their ranks with a move for highly-rated centre-back Senesi, who has signed a four-year deal at the Vitality Stadium. Bournemouth chief executive Neill Blake said: "This is a huge signing for us and Marcos brings significant pedigree to our squad. There was, inevitably, a lot of interest in him so for him to choose to come here is a clear sign of our appeal as a football club. "Bringing in a current Argentina international with experience in European competitions is another indication of the club   s ambition and we are all looking forward to seeing Marcos in an AFC Bournemouth shirt."
