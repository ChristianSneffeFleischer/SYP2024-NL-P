Fulham have confirmed the signing of Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Alphonse Areola on a season-long loan deal, which includes an option to buy. The Frenchman previously spent the 2019/20 campaign on loan at La Liga winners Real Madrid, but has now swapped Spain for England after linking up with the Championship play-off winners. .@AreolaOfficiel    We   ve got ourselves a new goalkeeper! #OhhLaAreola Areola has been with PSG since 2010, embarking on numerous loan spells before cementing his place in the starting lineup in 2017. However, with Keylor Navas the first choice stopper, the Ligue 1 champions have allowed him to leave the club for the forthcoming season. Speaking on the club's official website, Areola said:    I am very happy everything is done. Scott Parker called me and I had a good feeling. He said he really wanted me.    Fulham is a historic club in London and I have heard a lot about the stadium. I hope this season will be a good one for us. I want to bring my energy and do everything for this team to keep us where we belong to be.    Fulham owner Tony Khan added:    I   m thrilled to welcome Alphonse Areola to our Fulham family! Alphonse has experience at the very highest level, as he   s played in France   s national team, won the league title with PSG, had success at RC Lens, Bastia and with Villarreal, and most recently he played for Real Madrid as they won La Liga last season.    We   re excited that he   s joining us, and he   ll be an excellent addition to our squad as for our Premier League campaign ahead! Come on Fulham!
