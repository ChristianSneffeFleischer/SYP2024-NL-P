Manchester City are among a group of elite European clubs that includes Barcelona and Juventus tracking Borussia Monchengladbach forward Marcus Thuram. 23-year-old Thuram, the son of 1998 World Cup winning France star Lilian, has developed into one of the continent's most highly rated young attackers in recent years, having earned a move from Guingamp to Gladbach in 2019. Thuram scored 14 times in 39 appearances for the Germans in 2019/20, while he has continued his form into the new season. Normally played off the left of the front three, Thuram scored twice in the 2-2 Champions League draw with Real Madrid in October, while he picked up an assist in the 6-0 rout of Shakhtar on Tuesday. The player's form has lead to his first senior France call-up for the squad to face Finland (friendly), Portugal and Sweden (Nations League) this month. 23 years later... Marcus Thuram will follow in his father   s footsteps with the French national team. ??? pic.twitter.com/rUU5ko2oe2 According to BILD, Manchester City are one of a few clubs taking an interest in Thuram's progress. A report from the German outlet claims that City, Barcelona and Juventus are the most interested parties, while Real Madrid and Milan are also name-checked as possible future suitors. Though represented by notorious 'super-agent' Mino Raiola, it is said that Thuram's dad has 'excellent contacts' at former clubs Juventus and Barcelona, which is unsurprising. Crucially, it is added that the financial strain of playing the season without fans could hasten Gladbach's need to sell Thuram, who only joined a year ago for around    12m. While no price tag is mentioned, the Italian-born forward would surely command a fee several times that figure now.
