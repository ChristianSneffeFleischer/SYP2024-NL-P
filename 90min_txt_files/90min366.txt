Chelsea have confirmed the signing of highly-rated Brazilian youngster Angelo Gabriel from Santos. The wide player joins a long list of young players Chelsea have signed under new ownership Todd Boehly.

A club statement on the signing reads: "Chelsea has completed the signing of Brazilian winger Angelo Gabriel from Santos. "Born in Brasilia, the 18-year-old arrives at Stamford Bridge with a wealth of senior football under his belt; he made 129 first-team appearances for Santos across all competitions. "A left-footed winger who was regularly utilised off the right side of Santos    frontline, Angelo became the youngest player in the history of the Brazil national championship when he made his debut against Fluminense in the Maracan Â£, aged just 15 years and 308 days.   feed "In April 2021, the Brazil Under-20 international scored his first senior goal, a close-range finish away to Lorenzo in the Copa Libertadores. In doing so he became the youngest goalscorer in that historic competition. He scored four more times for Santos and claimed ten assists. "Welcome to Chelsea, Angelo!" The youngster is one of a number of talented Brazilians who have been scooped up by top European teams in recent months.
