Borussia Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke has rubbished speculation that his side are set to bid for Manchester United forward Cristiano Ronaldo. Ronaldo is yet to get the move away from Old Trafford that he has been looking for this summer, with most of Europe's top sides distancing themselves from making a move - many have even gone public with their dismissal of the rumours. Watzke has chosen the latter route, laughing off claims that Ronaldo's agent, Jorge Mendes, had offered the 37-year-old to the club. "I love him as a player, it's certainly a charming idea, to see Cristiano Ronaldo play at Signal Iduna Park," Watzke told a press conference. "But there is no contact at all between the parties involved. "So from now on, you should stop talking about it."
