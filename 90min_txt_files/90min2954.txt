Bayern Munich CEO Oliver Kahn has this time declined to discuss a transfer for Tottenham striker Harry Kane. The former goalkeeper recently described Kane as a 'dream of the future', while Bayern boss Julian Naglesmann has also gone public with his admiration of the striker - prompting a frustrated response from Spurs boss Antonio Conte. Seemingly concerned about upsetting Conte once again, Kahn declined to get drawn into a conversation about Kane when asked for an update on Bayern's interest. "I can just say that Harry Kane is an outstanding striker who is now under contract at Tottenham," Kahn told Bild. Conte has described Bayern's interest as 'only rumours' and reiterated the club's desire to keep Kane around for the foreseeable future.
