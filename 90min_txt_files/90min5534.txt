Barcelona have announced the    26m signing of Ajax right-back Sergino Dest as Ronald Koeman continues his rebuilding job at Camp Nou. The USA international has been linked with a move to Barcelona all summer having impressed in his breakthrough season with the Dutch champions during the 2019/20 campaign. Shhhhh ... pic.twitter.com/FcrRwES4JH Dest made 36 appearances in all competitions, providing six assists and two goals from full-back. Barcelona confirmed the news on their official club website, announcing that the 19-year-old has signed a five-year deal with the Catalan club, keeping him at Camp Nou until 2025. Barcelona have paid    21m up front plus an additional    5m for Dest, whose contract also includes a    400m buyout clause. The club confirmed he will be officially presented to the fans and media on Friday 2 October via a remote press conference. Dest is a Dutch-born American international who started out in the youth system of hometown club Almere, before moving to Ajax in 2012. He made his first team debut as an 18-year-old in July 2019 and went on to establish himself in the Ajax senior side during the 2019/20 campaign - earning international recognition in the process. Dest qualifies to play for the United States through his father and made his senior international debut in September 2019. He has earned three caps for his country so far. The right back actually played much of his youth career as a striker before moving to full back following an injury to a teammate - and his time spent as a forward has helped to shape him into a classic modern day attacking right back.
