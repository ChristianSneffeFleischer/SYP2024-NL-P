Arsenal loanee Dani Ceballos will leave the Gunners and return to Real Madrid at the end of the season, but Los Blancos are hoping to sell the Spaniard on a permanent basis this summer. The 24-year-old has spent the past two seasons on loan at the Emirates Stadium, but while his first year with the club was an undeniable success, his second campaign has been far more subdued. Arsenal have decided not to pursue a permanent deal for Ceballos this summer and he will instead return to Madrid after the Gunners' final match of the Premier League campaign, according to Fabrizio Romano. The Gunners are attempting to trim their squad in the upcoming transfer window, with Willian expected to leave and David Luiz already a confirmed departee. The Premier League giants are unlikely to spend huge money in the summer, so they'll need to reduce their wage bill before recruiting any reinforcements. That means that Arsenal will not take a gamble on signing Ceballos permanently. Mikel Arteta was able to get the best out of the Spaniard in their first season together, with the midfielder helping the Gunners to lift the FA Cup at the end of a tough year.
