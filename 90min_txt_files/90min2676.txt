Pedro Neto has confessed he is flattered to have attracted interest from Arsenal but has stressed his happiness at current club Wolves. 90min understands that Arsenal are looking to push forward with a move for 22-year-old Neto, who is back to full fitness after overcoming a nasty knee injury which kept him out of action for ten months between April 2021 and February 2022. Arsenal were among the sides to be offered the chance to move for Neto earlier this summer, alongside Chelsea and Manchester United, and they are now keen to open talks with Wolves to get a deal done.    I always like to hear this sort of stuff but I   m focused on my job here because I   m feeling very good here,    he told The Times of the interest in him.    The things you hear makes you work even more, it   s good for you and your mentality to know that people know your value. It gives me more hunger to work harder.    Neto went on to admit that he aspires to play European football but insisted his focus was on leading Wolves to the Champions League, rather than joining another side.    The dream of any player is to play in the Champions League,    he continued.    I want to help this club to go higher and higher because I think we have that potential with the way we work, the way we sign players, the way we try to arrive there.
