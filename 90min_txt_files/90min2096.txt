Crystal Palace are hopeful that they will win the race to sign Aaron Wan-Bissaka from Manchester United, sources have told 90min. The 25-year-old has struggled with injuries so far this season and has made just one appearance under Erik ten Hag. 90min revealed earlier in December that United would sanction Wan-Bissaka's departure as they look to revamp their options at right-back, and several Premier League sides have since registered an interest. West Ham and Wolves are keen on Wan-Bissaka - the latter looking to bolster their squad under new manager Julen Lopetegui and provide competition for Nelson Semedo - but 90min understands that Palace are hoping to re-sign the defender, initially on loan. Wan-Bissaka first joined Palace as an 11-year-old and played much of his youth career as a winger, eventually being converted to a no-nonsense full-back.
