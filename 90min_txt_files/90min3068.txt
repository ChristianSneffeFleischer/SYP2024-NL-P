Cristiano Ronaldo has rejected a mammoth contract offer worth    275m from an unnamed Saudi Arabian club.  Ronaldo has been heavily linked with a move away from Manchester United this summer, with Chelsea believed to have been favourites to sign the forward for the last month.  90min reported on Thursday that the Blues have now decided against going after CR7 - despite new owner Todd Boehly being initially enticed by the opportunity to make a statement signing. According to ESPN, the latest club to register interest in the five-time Ballon d'Or winner are an unnamed one from Saudi Arabia. The club are said to have tabled a    30m bid for Ronaldo's services, and also offered the player an astonishing deal that would see the 37-year-old earn    275m for just two years.
