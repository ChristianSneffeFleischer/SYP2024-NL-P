11 players have departed Liverpool following the expiration of their contracts. Reds boss Jurgen Klopp is looking to remodel his squad after a disappointing campaign and has been active in the transfer window already, landing midfielder Alexis Mac Allister from Brighton and striking a deal to add RB Leipzig's Dominik Szoboszlai for    70m. There is space for the new faces at Anfield as Liverpool have bid farewell to no fewer than three midfielders: James Milner, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Naby Keita. Milner spent eight years at the club and racked up a cool 332 appearances, and he won't have to wait long for a reunion with Liverpool after inking a deal to join Brighton. Like Milner, Keita has also found himself a new club already. The Guinea international has returned to the Bundesliga with Werder Bremen, five years after leaving Germany for Anfield. feed Perhaps the most emotional departure of all is that of striker Roberto Firmino. Liverpool have already paid tribute to the Brazilian, who racked up 111 goals and 79 assists in 362 games for the Reds before embarking on a new adventure this summer. Nothing has been signed just yet but Firmino is a significant target for the Saudi Pro League and is expected to make the move to the Middle East. The Liverpool academy has also seen the departures of seven talents: Jack Bearne, Fidel O'Rourke, Iwan Roberts, Liam Hughes, Oscar Kelly, Charlie Hayes-Green and Oludare Olufunwa. Bearne is the only one of the group to have made an appearance for the senior side, coming off the bench in the FA Cup quarter-final against Aston Villa in 2019.
