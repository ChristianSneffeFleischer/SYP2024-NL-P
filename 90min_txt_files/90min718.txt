Atalanta are in talks over a deal for Almeria striker El Bilal Toure, who is being lined up to replace Manchester United target Rasmus Hojlund, sources have confirmed to 90min. The 21-year-old Mali international joined Almeria from Reims last year and played a pivotal role in keeping them in La Liga. Despite injuries hampering him, Toure claimed seven goals from 21 games, including the winner goal in their a win against title-winners Barcelona. He is now set to move again, with Atalanta opening talks over a    25m deal, although there is rival interest from Serie A winners Napoli. 90min also understands that Everton are keen to launch a bid for Toure, but they are not in a position at this moment to match Atalanta's offer. feed Atalanta have made their move for Toure as 90min understands that the club have already accepted that Hojlund will leave this summer. Hojlund, who has emerged as one of Man Utd's top striker targets this transfer window, has already informed Atalanta that he is looking to leave and he is set to get his wish. Aside from Man Utd, sources have told 90min that Inter, Napoli and Juventus have all registered an interest with Atalanta. Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain have also held talks with the player's representatives in recent months. Hojlund scored 10 goals and added four assists in 34 games in his debut season for Atalanta.
