Roma have held talks with Barcelona over a potential move for Memphis Depay, sources have confirmed to 90min. Depay has only started two games for Bar  a this season and it is known that he is keen to leave, but he only wants to depart on the right terms. Barcelona are open to Depay leaving Camp Nou just as they were in the summer. At that time, they could not agree terms of a sale and they remain unwilling to let him go unless the price is right. Depay, who is enjoying a good World Cup with the Netherlands, almost joined Juventus but the two clubs could not agree on a transfer. When a deal looked close, Depay and Bar  a then were not able to agree on the exact terms of his departure. Jose Mourinho is now eager to take him to Roma in the New Year, but terms of a deal are far form being agreed. Roma are happy to take him, but it has not been decided whether it would be on loan until his contract expires at the end of the season or on a longer term permanent deal. Barcelona are reluctant for any move to go through without gaining some financial benefit due to issues they are having with Financial Fair Play.

Why should we sell Depay in January if it   s difficult to sign new players because of Financial Fair Play? He   s always been a great professional. He can be really helpful. We will see in the next months [if he will leave as a free agent],    Cruyff said.
