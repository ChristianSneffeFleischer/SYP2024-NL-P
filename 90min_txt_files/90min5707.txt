Sevilla have signed left-back Marcos Acuna from Sporting CP amid speculation the Spanish outfit are eying up a second loan spell for Manchester United target Sergio Reguil  n. Reguil  n spent the 2019/20 season on loan at Sevilla, helping to guide the club to another Europa League title and spot in the Champions League. He enjoyed a breakthrough season, earning his maiden senior call-up to the Spanish national team. The defender has been pursued by Manchester United this summer as the Red Devils attempt to add depth to the left back position. Luke Shaw endured another injury-hampered campaign last season, with the right-footed Brandon Williams often filling in at left-back. However, United face competition from Sevilla for Reguil  n's signature, with the Europa League champions reportedly keen to bring him on loan for another season. This option could appeal to the 23-year-old, as it would leave the door open for a return to parent club Real Madrid - a dream club for any Spaniard. In contrast, a permanent move to United would signal a complete end to his time at the Bernabeu after just 14 La Liga appearances, absent some manner of buy-back clause. ? @AcunaMarcos17 ya es nuevo jugador sevillista y viajar   de inmediato para incorporarse al stage en tierras alicantinas.       ???#vamosmiSevilla #WeareSevilla However, fears that United may lose out on Reguil  n to Sevilla have been eased after the Spanish side announced the signing of fellow left back Acuna. The 28-year-old Argentinian international has signed a four-year deal at the club, and could be a permanent replacement for Reguil  n - who featured 31 times in La Liga for Sevilla last season.
