Pep Guardiola has said that Cristiano Ronaldo is ultimately the master of his own future amid speculation linking him with a move to Manchester City.  Ronaldo is actively trying to depart Juventus after three seasons in Turin and City are in talks over a deal. His agent, Jorge Mendes, is trying to broker a deal with the Cityzens and 90min understands that the legendary forward is willing to take a substantial pay cut to complete a move. However, it has since emerged that Man Utd are also in the race for his signature. Asked about the situation at his pre-match press conference on Friday, Guardiola said: "I say the same; Cristiano will decide where he wants to play, not Manchester City, not myself. There are many things that are far away. "I am incredibly happy with the squad I have. More than satisfied. We are the same guys except Sergio [Aguero] left and Jack [Grealish] arrived. I focus on what we have to do and the players we have right now." City's interest in Ronaldo coincided with Harry Kane announcing that he would be staying at Tottenham Hotspur. Kane had been agitating for a move to City all summer but Spurs remained firm in their insistence that he was going nowhere.  "I cannot say much. Harry Kane announced he is continuing to his club, an exceptional club like Tottenham. Cristiano is a Juventus player and I can't say anything else. All I can say in these three, four days left of the transfer window anything can happen," Guardiola said.
