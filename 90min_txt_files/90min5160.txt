Tottenham midfielder Harry Winks has been tipped to seek a move away in January, amid growing frustration that a lack of game time could cost him a place in England's squad for next summer's rescheduled Euro 2020. Winks has not started a Premier League game since September, and did not even feature in the 18-man squad for last weekend's trip to London rivals Chelsea. Then, despite being named in the Europa League squad by Jose Mourinho to face LASK, the 24-year old did not feature in Thursday night's 3-3 draw. ? https://t.co/d54AAjzWvk England boss Gareth Southgate has previously stated that his players need regular football to stay in contention for a place in his squad, indirectly hinting that Winks may be best served by seeking to leave Spurs. Now, the Mirror claim that Winks has been frustrated at being in and out of the Tottenham side this season, and fears losing his place in Southgate's squad unless things change. Until now, Winks has been a favourite of the England boss, and featured in all three of last month's internationals, starting against Ireland and putting in an encouraging second half performance against Belgium. While he was a regular under Mauricio Pochettino and was favoured by Mourinho last season, Winks has failed to nail down a place at Tottenham this season thanks to the form of summer signing Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg and France international Moussa Sissoko. Tanguy Ndombele has also shone this season, impressing greatly after struggling to adapt to the pace of Premier League football in his maiden campaign. As for Winks, he's admitted last month that his "situation is difficult", and says that starting for England at Euro 2020 is one of his primary goals.
