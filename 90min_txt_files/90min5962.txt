Manchester United youngsters James Garner, Dylan Levitt and Mat  j Kov     are all set to leave Old Trafford on loan for the upcoming season. Manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is looking to trim down his squad and find temporary homes for a number of the club's young stars, with Tahith Chong and Aliou Traor   already leaving to join Werder Bremen and Caen respectively. According to the Manchester Evening News, club officials have identified Garner, Levitt and Kov     as three of the next group of players who should be loaned out after all enjoying outstanding campaigns with United's Under-23s. Of the trio, Garner has attracted the most interest. The 19-year-old midfielder managed six appearances for Solskjaer's senior side last season and is wanted by a whole host of teams in the Championship. Swansea City are named as a possible destination, with United likely impressed with the platform offered to Chelsea youngsters Conor Gallagher and Marc Guehi and Liverpool's Rhian Brewster last season. As for goalkeeper Kov    , League One sides like Swindon Town and Doncaster Rovers have expressed an interest, with the Czech youth international keen to go out and play some senior football this season. There is no mention of where 19-year-old midfielder Levitt could end up, but as a youth team star who has already been included in Ryan Giggs' senior Wales squad, there will likely be no shortage of offers. Under-23 manager Neil Wood has been working with Solskjaer to determine which young players would benefit from time away and which are ready to take up a minor role in the first team, with Teden Mengi, Ethan Laird and Hannibal Mejbri all expected to fall into the latter bracket.
