Pep Guardiola has again played down the prospect of signing a striker despite City's struggles in front goal, and effectively ruled out any transfer business in January.  The Blues have struggled to find their usual attacking ruthlessness this season and often had to do without Sergio Aguero and Gabriel Jesus, with the pair both struggling for fitness. As a result, they've managed just 19 goals from their opening 13 Premier League games, compared to 37 at the same point last season. Quoted by Goal, Guardiola rebuffed the prospect of signing a striker in January: "No I don   t think so. The economic financial situation is what it is. All the clubs struggle and we are no exception". He added, citing momentum as the issue: "It   s not a lack of rhythm     it   s a lack of momentum to score goals. They make good situations, it   s not rhythm, it   s momentum. "Goals are something special, it   s a touch and a flow and now we don   t have it". Injuries to their two main strikers is the likely cause of City's lack of 'momentum' in attack. Aguero has managed just six appearances in all competitions so far this season, returning to action in their final Champions League group stage fixture with a goal before being ruled out of the Manchester derby three days later, as a knee injury continues to plague him. A post shared by Sergio Leonel Agu  ero (@kunaguero) Aguero's injury woes would've presented the ideal opportunity for Jesus to stake his claim as City's number nine, but fitness issues of his own have limited the Brazilian to just 10 appearances in all competitions. It's led to summer signing Ferran Torres often being deployed as the de-facto centre forward.
