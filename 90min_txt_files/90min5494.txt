AC Milan have confirmed the signing of Manchester United defender Diogo Dalot on loan for the 2020/21 season.  The 21-year-old joined United from Porto in the summer of 2018 for around  Â£19m, but has struggled to establish himself in a turbulent period for the club. He played 90 minutes in the 3-0 League Cup victory over Brighton, but that was his only appearance this season.

United have been open to loan offers in order for the 21-year-old to continue his development, and it was reported last week that Milan had opened talks.  They have now been able to confirm the deal, which will run until the end of the 2020/21 season.  Dalot will wear the number five shirt at San Siro.  A graduate of the Porto youth academy, Dalot broke into the first-team aged just 18 in 2018. He'd made just eight senior appearances for the club when United moved to snap him up, and showed some promise in his debut season in England.
