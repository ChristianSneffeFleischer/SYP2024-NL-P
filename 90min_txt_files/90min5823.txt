Leicester City have confirmed the arrival of Timothy Castagne from Atalanta on a five-year-deal. The wing-back becomes the Foxes' first signing of the transfer window, after they sold Ben Chilwell to Chelsea last week. ? #WelcomeTimothy ? pic.twitter.com/Loi1xadjIQ Castagne is capable of operating as both a right back and left back and has played a key role in Atalanta's surprise success over the past few years. Arriving in Bergamo from Genk in 2017, the Belgium international went on to make just under a century of appearances for Gian Piero Gasperini's side.  Castagne should have no problem fitting in at the King Power Stadium, having already played with midfield pair Youri Tielemans and Dennis Praet in the Red Devils international setup. He was also at Genk with fellow Foxes star Wilfred Ndidi, with the two players making their first team debuts under then manager Alex Mcleish just a few months apart. Last season, Castagne featured 33 times in all competitions as Atalanta came within minutes of reaching the Champions League semi finals. Gasperini's side were leading Paris-Saint Germain with just a few minutes to go, only for the Parisians to secure a memorable, last gasp victory.  Ben Chilwell might be gone, but the signing of the versatile Timothy Castagne should soften that blow...       @matthewOCS The 24-year-old joins a Foxes squad already teaming with talented full backs, including Ricardo Pereira, James Justin and hot prospect Luke Thomas. Castagne could also be deployed as a wing-back as Rodgers used a 3-4-1-2 towards the end of last season.
