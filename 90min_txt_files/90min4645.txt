Manchester United are considering a summer move for Wolves forward Pedro Neto, according to a report. Neto has enjoyed a solid season, despite his side's struggles since star striker Raul Jimenez was ruled out with a fractured skull in November.  The 21-year-old - who Wolves signed from Lazio back in 2019 - has managed five goals and four assists in the Premier League, already an improvement on what he managed last campaign. According to The Sun, his performances have caught the eye of United, who are weighing up a potential move for the forward. Neto is said to have trialled at Old Trafford in 2016 and although he did not do enough to impress on that occasion, he could end up at the club in the summer.  United view him as a genuine alternative to Jadon Sancho, who they spent the entirety of 2020 trying to sign. The Red Devils have not given up hope of signing the England international, but with Borussia Dortmund standing firm on their hefty  Â£100m asking price and the potential summer sale of Erling Haaland further muddying the waters, they are looking at other candidates as well.
