Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag has been filmed signing autographs for children and facing questions from them regarding the possible signings of Kylian Mbappe and Jude Bellingham. After a rocky start to life at Old Trafford which saw the Red Devils humiliated in losses to Brighton and Brentford, Ten Hag has managed to steady the ship following his summer arrival from Ajax. The Dutchman's stock is high among fans again following a run of seven straight wins in all competitions, while he has also been praised for his handling of the Cristiano Ronaldo saga. Back in the good books of the United faithful, Ten Hag was recently filmed signing autographs outside the club's Carrington training complex, during which he took time to talk to some youngsters about his transfer plans. He was first asked if he thinks United can sign Bellingham, to which he replied: "I want to!" Ten Hag was then quizzed on whether he would like Mbappe, and joking retorted: "Have you some pennies for me?!"

The Netherlands World Cup star is currently at Besiktas and United would have to reach an agreement with them in order for a deal to go through. Meanwhile, other reports claim that United have introduced a 'Ronaldo rule' to bring the club's wage bill down, with salaries now capped at  Â£200,000-a-week.
