Clement Lenglet has spoken out about his time at Barcelona, claiming he is "not finished" at the club despite spending this season on loan at Tottenham Hotspur. The French defender was loaned to Spurs this summer, having lost the trust of Bar  a manager Xavi following a series of erratic displays during his four years at the club. Lenglet never truly established himself during his time at Barcelona and gained notoriety in 2021 with a poor performance in the Champions League thrashing by Bayern Munich. However, Lenglet's loan to Spurs has largely been a success thus far, with the centre-back impressing during his few games for the club. Speaking to The Guardian, Lenglet suggested his time at Barcelona was not over yet, but also that he remains open to the possibility of staying at Spurs beyond this season.    It was an amazing experience at Barcelona and it is not finished because I have a contract until 2026,    Lenglet says.    We don   t have an option [to extend at Spurs]. We have to wait before thinking about this. I have to be good on the pitch, to help the team. Maybe if everything is OK, we will speak but it   s too early.    Lenglet also offered his assessment of Spurs' performances so far this season.
