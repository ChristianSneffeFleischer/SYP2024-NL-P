Los Angeles FC have agreed a deal in principle with Chelsea to loan forward Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, 90min understands. The Gabonese striker is unhappy with his current situation at Stamford Bridge, where he's started just four of his 11 Premier League appearances so far this season since joining from Barcelona. It's understood a number of MLS clubs have expressed an interest in bringing Aubameyang across the Atlantic but - as reported by MLSsoccer.com's Tom Bogert - 90min understands LAFC have emerged as the frontrunner, finding agreement with Chelsea for the loan of the 33-year-old. However, there is a long way to go if Aubameyang is to wear a black and gold jersey. It's understood the player is far keener on remaining in Europe and is yet to give a final decision either way, with Aubameyang expected to make the definitive call sometime this weekend.  On this edition of Son of Chelsea, part of the 90min podcast network, Daniel Childs is joined by Adrian Sousa of Rabona TV to break down the skills of Enzo Fernandez, his impactful spell at Benfica & more.
