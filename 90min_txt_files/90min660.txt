Minnesota United have announced the signing of Finland international striker Teemu Pukki on a Designated Player contract. Pukki was available on a free transfer after his contract with EFL Championship side Norwich City expired. He spent five years in England and played two campaigns in the Premier League, scoring double digits of goals in every season at Carrow Road. In total, Pukki scored 88 goals in 210 games for the Canaries. The 33-year-old has now completed a move to Minnesota United in Major League Soccer on an initial two-year Designated Player contract. MNUFC Head Coach Adrian Heath said in a release: "I feel as though we have gotten that goalscorer we have been craving ever since Christian Ramirez left. He's a gold standard, proven goalscorer. "If you look at his record he's scored at a high level at every team he's played for. His goalscoring record in the Premier League, the Championship and the Finnish National Team speaks for itself.   He's a great professional, what you see is what you get, always as a smile on his face, gets his work done and is a great teammate. "The fact is, he scores goals and I know that if we continue to create the opportunities we have this season he will no doubt be successful in this league. We are delighted to get him here and get him integrated with the group."
