Mauricio Pochettino has admitted that Chelsea are 'working really hard' to recruit their top targets this summer, with their pursuit of Brighton's Moises Caicedo proving challenging. The Blues have recently seen a  £70m bid knocked back by Brighton, who are holding out for closer to  £100m to part ways with the Ecuador international, who has made it clear that he wants to move to Stamford Bridge this summer. Chelsea had hoped to have Caicedo's signing wrapped up before Pochettino's squad set off for pre-season in the United States but talks with Brighton have not yet reached the desired conclusion. Asked for an update on the Caicedo deal, Pochettino refused to mention any specific names but explained where the Blues find themselves in the transfer market. "All the team are working hard to get who we want," the boss said. "I don't want to talk about specific names. It's not respectful. Like us, many clubs are working to sign a player to improve their team." feed The boss continued: "We are working really hard to finish the squad. I think the players are showing commitment and working so well. We are so happy with the way they are working.  "We need to work during this pre-season to be a really strong squad and then to evolve in the way we want to play and to apply the concept we expect from then." Chelsea will continue negotiating with Caicedo and hope that Brighton will agree to lower their demands without needing to include centre-back Levi Colwill as part of a deal. Colwill, who spent last season on loan with Brighton, is wanted back at the AMEX on a permanent deal but Chelsea are adamant he is not for sale. The 20-year-old has spoken with Pochettino this summer in search of clarity over his future.
