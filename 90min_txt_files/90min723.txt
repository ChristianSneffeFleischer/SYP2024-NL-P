Tottenham Hotspur are looking to wrap up the signing of Guglielmo Vicario quickly amid fears of late rival bids from Serie A sides, 90min understands. Spurs have spent recent months identifying goalkeeper targets and finding potential long-term successors to club captain Hugo Lloris, who has admitted he wants to leave for a new challenge this summer. 90min reported earlier in June that Brentford's David Raya was their top target and personal terms were not an issue, but the Bees' insistence that the Spain international would not be sold for less than  Â£40m proved to be an insurmountable stumbling block for Tottenham. They began looking at other targets at the start of this week and quickly settled on 26-year-old Vicario, who broke into Italy's senior setup last season and is viewed as one of Serie A's finest goalkeepers. Tottenham have agreed a    20m fee with Empoli and Vicario is set to fly to London to undergo a medical, but sources have told 90min that Spurs are wary that there could be another twist in this transfer race. Inter and Milan are both admirers of Vicario and are in similar positions where their current goalkeepers - Andre Onana and Mike Maignan respectively - could leave this window. feed As such, Tottenham are attempting to push through a deal for Vicario, who is in line to become their second signing under new head coach Ange Postecoglou following Dejan Kulusevski's permanent move. Speaking to Lady Radio on Thursday, Empoli president Fabrizio Corsi admitted that he was proud to see Vicario taking such a big step in his career. "We bought him back to sell him on. We also paid a lot to sign him considering our finances," he said. "It's a source of pride for us that the top teams have him in their sights. He's also a special person, not just as a footballer."
