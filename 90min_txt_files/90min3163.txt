Nottingham Forest have confirmed the signing of Moussa Niakhate from Mainz on an initial three-year deal.  Niakhate departs the Bundesliga side following four impressive seasons, during which time he racked up 135 appearances in all competitions.  Though predominantly used at centre-back in recent years, the 26-year-old is also comfortable on the left.  Niakhate - who has been expected to sign for some time - reacted to his arrival in an interview posted on the club's website.  "For me, this a dream to come to England and to sign for such a historic club in Nottingham Forest. The club is well known around the world and its fans are incredible," he said. "The Premier League is also the best league in the world and every player wants to play here. "I   m just so excited to get started in pre-season, meet my new teammates and get ready for the new season, wearing the Garibaldi red and white at the City Ground." "Moussa comes to Forest with a wealth of experience in one of Europe   s top competitions, having enjoyed four seasons with Mainz in the Bundesliga," Forest boss Steve Cooper added. "In addition to being a strong, fast and accomplished centre back, he   s captained Mainz to their best league finish in the last five years, and his leadership experience is invaluable for our return to the Premier League. "Moussa has attracted the interest of multiple clubs, but he has chosen Nottingham Forest and we are delighted to welcome him into the squad." Diakhate becomes Forest's fourth signing of the window after Taiwo Awoniyi, Giulian Biancone and Dean Henderson.
