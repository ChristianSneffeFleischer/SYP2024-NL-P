Talented Chelsea youngster Cesare Casadei has joined Championship side Leicester City on a season-long loan.  Casadei spent the 2022/23 campaign on loan in the same division with Reading, making 15 appearances and scoring one goal.  The midfielder has recently caught the eye much more at Under-20 level for Italy, winning the Golden Ball and Golden Boot awards for his stunning performances in the FIFA Under-20 World Cup. In Italy's run to the final - a final they'd lose to Uruguay 1-0 - Casadei managed a thoroughly impressive seven goals in seven games.  With Chelsea confirming the British record signing of Moises Caicedo this week and also closing in on Romeo Lavia from Southampton, the Italian midfielder has now secured a loan to Leicester in order to get some game time under his belt.  feed Speaking to the Foxes' official website after making the move, Casadei said: "I feel really good. I   m really happy to be here, I   m excited and I can   t wait to get started. Obviously, Leicester is a big team so I   m here to win and to do as well as possible to fight and to work hard for this team." In a statement released by Chelsea, the club's co-sporting directors Laurence Stewart and Paul Winstanley added: "This loan move is the perfect opportunity for Cesare to continue his progression as an exciting, young footballer. "We   re excited to see how he performs under Enzo Maresca at Leicester and look forward to watching him continue on this journey."
