Manchester United are understood to have expressed an interest in signing Braga central defender David Carmo. The 21-year-old has attracted the attention of a number of teams around Europe after impressing in the Premiera Liga, with Roma and Fiorentina both known to have enquired about his availability in the summer. Neither side decided to formalise their interest with a firm bid, and ESPN note that Manchester United are now keeping tabs on the left-sided central defender. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is keen to bolster competition on that side for first-choice, and captain, Harry Maguire, though it is noted that any deal would need to be funded by offloading some of United's fringe players. Phil Jones and Marcos Rojo are both out of favour at Old Trafford, and are expected to head for the exit door in January if United are able to find them new clubs. Jones has not featured for ten months, while Rojo hasn't donned a United shirt since October 2019 and spent the second half of last seasonon loan at Estudiantes. If United were able to conclude a deal for Carmo, they'd be bringing in a player with significant pedigree at international youth level. He was part of the Portugal Under-19 side that won the 2018 European Championship, and he's kicked on from then to become an established part of Braga's defence.
