Celtic have completed the signing of Sead Haksabanovic on a five-year deal from Russian side Rubin Kazan. The 23-year-old - who spent three years on the books at West Ham and made two first-team appearances there - was most recently on loan at Djurgardens IF in the Allsvenskan. He becomes Celtic's seventh signing of the summer, following deals for Cameron Carter-Vickers, Benjamin Siegrist, Alexandro Bernabei, Jota, Moritz Jenz and Aaron Mooy. He told Celtic TV: "It feels amazing. What I know about Celtic is only good things and I   m very happy to be here. 'I heard about it around a month ago and as soon as I heard that Celtic wanted me I said to my agent that he had to make it happen because this is where I want to play.' "It   s an amazing club with good players, fans and history. "I   ve been watching some games and I think the team play in the same style as me. "I   ve been speaking to the manager as well and we had a good chat, speaking about how he sees me as a player and how he wants me to fit into his system and everything sounded good so that was it for me. "I   m a playmaker with some flair, I   m good in one-on-ones, I have a powerful shot, I   m quick and I   ll give everything for this club. 'The team are doing great and I want to be part of that and make the fans, the club and myself happy.'
