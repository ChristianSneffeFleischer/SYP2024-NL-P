Amad Diallo's proposed loan move from Manchester United to Dutch side Feyenoord has been cancelled after the young winger was injured in training. The 19-year-old was all set to complete a season-long switch to the Netherlands in a bid to get more game time under his belt, but the deal has now been cancelled. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer had revealed a deal was close on Friday, but just two days later the training injury has put paid to a move - and according to Feyenoord technical direct Frank Arnesen, Diallo could be out for some time. Speaking to Dutch outlet AD, Arnesen said: "He got injured, it's cancelled.    Too bad, everything was done. I've talked a lot with the people at Manchester United, but it's more sensible to let him recover at that club. It may be a while before he comes back." The news will come as a blow to all the parties involved, with United keen to get the young Ivorian some game time away from the club following the big-money arrival of Jadon Sancho from Borussia Dortmund, which has pushed the teenager down the pecking order. The surprise return of Cristiano Ronaldo has only limited his chances of first-team action further.
