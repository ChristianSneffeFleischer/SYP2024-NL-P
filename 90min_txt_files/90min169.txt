Al Nassr have unveiled Sadio Mane following completion of his transfer from Bayern Munich. Mane had initially resisted interest from the Saudi Pro League, before performing a surprise U-turn and agreeing personal terms with Al Nassr in July. Bayern were open to selling Mane, who had a disappointing first season following a big money move from Liverpool, as soon as the 2022/23 club campaign ended. At first, it was Al Ettifaq showing interest following the appointment of Steven Gerrard as manager. But terms were quickly agreed once Al Nassr stepped in, with Mane still reluctant to make the move to Saudi Arabia as recently as early July. In the words of Bayern coach Thomas Tuchel, Mane "fell short of expectations" during his what will now have been his sole season with the club. feed The Senegal international was often used in an alien central role following the departure of Robert Lewandowski and frustrations eventually boiled over to the point where he physically lashed out at teammate Leory Sane, landing an international suspension and club record fine. Mane now links up with Cristiano Ronaldo at the Riyadh-based Al Nassr. Since signing Ronaldo in the winter, the club have remained busy in the transfer market this summer. Mane is the fourth high profile player to make the switch from Europe in recent weeks, following in the footsteps of Marcelo Brozovic, Seko Fofana and Alex Telles. Mane's quick move on from Bayern without triggering the add-ons in his 2022 transfer from Liverpool is set to deny the Premier League side as much as  Â£7.5m in additional income.
