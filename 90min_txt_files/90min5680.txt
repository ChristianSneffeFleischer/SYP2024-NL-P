English right-back Nathaniel Clyne is set to train with Crystal Palace, following his release from Liverpool earlier this summer.  Clyne began his career with the Eagles, winning the club's Player of the Year award in 2011, before departing to Southampton. After impressing during a three-year spell with the Saints, he made the move to Anfield for around  Â£12.5m, where he spent five seasons.  However, while he was a regular in his first two seasons at Liverpool, injuries and the emergence of Trent Alexander-Arnold saw Clyne fall down the pecking order, and he just made 10 appearances in all competitions across the last three seasons for the Reds. The 14-cap England international was let go by the Premier League champions at the end of his contract, and is now set to begin training with the Eagles, as confirmed by the club's official website. Though the official announcement suggests Clyne is only to return to his former club for a 'short period' with the intention of regaining fitness, Roy Hodgson will be on the hunt for numbers in defence.  His squad has been left light at the back following injuries to Gary Cahill, Patrick van Aanholt, James Tomkins and Nathan Ferguson. With challenging fixtures against Manchester United, Everton, and Chelsea coming up, they may see Clyne as an easy and experienced option for depth at the back. Elsewhere at Selhurst Park, Norwegian forward Alexander Sorloth is set to make the switch to RB Leipzig.  Sorloth's career at Crystal Palace never took off after his move from Danish club FC Midtjylland, scoring just once in 20 outings.  The 24-year-old spent the last year on loan at Turkish side Trabzonspor, where he won the Super Lig Golden Boot.
