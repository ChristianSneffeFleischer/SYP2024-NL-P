Donny Van de Beek's management have denied reports the player is looking to quit Manchester United less than a year after joining the club from Ajax. The 24-year-old arrived for a fee of  Â£35m last September and has struggled to hold down a regular place in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side, with midfield rivals Paul Pogba, Scott McTominay, Bruno Fernandes and Fred all earning more opportunities. VI's Simon Zwartkruis revealed during the VI EK Live talk show that he recently had a conversation with the player's agent who strongly denied the rumours.    He said it was complete bulls**t," claims Zwartkruis. "There has been a conversation with the trainer about next season. He just has to get fit quickly, so that on day one he is the strong Van de Beek they bought at the time." Van de Beek made 19 appearances in the Premier League last season but was only selected in the starting XI four times. He played 15% of United's total minutes in the English top-flight and despite arriving with plenty of promise, the Dutchman was very much a peripheral figure. ?    Donny van de Beek blijft gewoon bij Manchester United: @simonzwartkruis:    Zijn zaakwaarnemer zegt dat de geruchten compleet gelul zijn.

While there has been much speculation regarding a potential move away in recent weeks, it appears it's nothing more than hot air. His contract in the north of England runs until 2025 and judging by this latest information, albeit having been passed on through a third party, Van de beek has no intention of giving up on his United dream just yet.
