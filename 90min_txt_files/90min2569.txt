Leeds United have not ruled out letting Dan James go this transfer window amid interest from Tottenham, 90min understands. Spurs remain in the market for a right wing-back and would ideally like another forward, if not a player comfortable in either role. They have heavily pursued Roma's Nicolo Zaniolo this window for these reasons. 90min understands that James is on their shortlist and they have held talks with Leeds over a late move for the Wales international, with the West Yorkshire club open to letting him leave. Speaking on James' future after Tuesday's draw with Everton, manager Jesse Marsch said: "I like Dan and I think he has been a big part of what we have done here before I came and since I have been here. "I don't anticipate big movement in the group, but we have to see what happens in the next 24 hours." Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  &  Toby Cudworth  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Lucas Paqueta's move to West Ham, Chelsea's plans to sign Anthony Gordon, Wesley Fofana and Arsen Zakharyan and the latest from Old Trafford.
