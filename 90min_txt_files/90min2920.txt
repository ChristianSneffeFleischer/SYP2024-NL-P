Chelsea have reached an agreement to sign young goalkeeper Gabriel Slonina from MLS side Chicago Fire, 90min understands. Slonina has enjoyed a meteoric rise over the past 12 months, becoming the Fire's number one and making a string of impressive displays despite his tender years - drawing comparisons to the legendary Gianluigi Buffon. The teenager has already earned a number of call-ups to the USMNT senior squad, although he is yet to make his senior debut. 90min reported in June that Chelsea had moved ahead of European champions Real Madrid in the race for the 18-year-old's signature, with personal terms agreed earlier this month before an official bid of $10m ( Â£8.5m) was made. That offer has been accepted with added bonuses, and 90min understands an agreement is in place for Slonina to move to Stamford Bridge - although he will remain on loan with Chicago Fire until the start of January 2023 following the conclusion of the MLS campaign. The goalkeeper is set to undergo a medical in the coming days before the deal is officially confirmed. It will be a record transfer for an American goalkeeper.
