Watford have turned down a bid from Newcastle United for exciting young forward Joao Pedro, 90min understands. The Magpies are looking to strengthen their options up front with an additional striker and wide forward, and have a number of players shortlisted ahead of possible bids before the summer window closes. Marseille's Bamba Dieng is one player Newcastle are tracking closely, along with a host of other Premier League clubs, but sources have confirmed to 90min that a bid just shy of  Â£20m for Brazilian forward Joao Pedro has been rebuffed. The 20-year-old has started all three of Watford's Championship games this season, scoring the winning goal against Sheffield United on the opening day, and the club's stance is that the player is not for sale.
