Brentford manager Thomas Frank has defended his club's decision to demand  £40m for goalkeeper David Raya this summer. Having entered the final year of his contract at the Brentford Community Stadium, Raya has attracted interest from a number of top clubs from across Europe but his price tag has thus far proven too high for any suitors to come forward with a bid. Earlier this summer as Tottenham withdrew their interest, Raya himself admitted he felt the  £40m demand was likely to prevent him from sealing his desired move away from the club. Arsenal are the latest side to voice an interest in Raya, joining Bayern Munich in the race for the Spain international, but despite already seeing suitors drop away because of their asking price, Brentford are determined to stand firm. "I would love to get  £40m," Frank told the media when asked about Arsenal's interest. "That   s what he   s worth. I think he   s one of the best keepers, he was one of the four best keepers in the Premier League last season, so what is the price? feed "What was Declan Rice, one year left?  £105m? Is that a fair price? And [Harry] Kane, you're talking one year left and he will cost what,  £150m? The keeper is at his best age, I think. "But anyway, it's a good thing I am not negotiating. That is for Phil [Giles] and Matthew [Benham] and Arsenal and the others, so they must take care of that. I just take care of the coaching." Brentford have already signed a new goalkeeper this summer, recruiting Mark Flekken from Freiburg  for a fee of around  £11m.
