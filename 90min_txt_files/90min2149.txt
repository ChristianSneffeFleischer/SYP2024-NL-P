Arsenal have held talks with Shakhtar Donetsk over winger Mykhaylo Mudryk, sources have confirmed to 90min. The 21-year-old is one of the most in-demand forwards in Europe right now, and Shakhtar are open to selling their prized asset     but only at the right price. Shakhtar have publicly stated that Mudryk now carries a price-tag of    100m using Manchester City's acquisition of Jack Grealish as the guide for that asking price.     Whoever wants to sign Mudryk has to pay a big amount of money otherwise our president will not sell him,    Donetsk director of football Darijo Srna said over the weekend.    Jack Grealish was sold for more than    100m and Mudryk   s level is not lower.    Mudryk himself has made no secret of his interest in moving. He was close to joining Brentford in the summer and then saw a potential deal with Bayer Leverkusen collapse. AC Milan, Juventus, Ajax and Newcastle United have all looked closely at him too in recent months, but 90min understands that Arsenal are now seen as leading the chase to land him.
