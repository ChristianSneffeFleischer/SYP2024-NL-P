Chelsea have confirmed that 18-year-old striker Tino Anjorin has put pen to paper on a new five-year contract at the club. The striker made his first-team debut in a Carabao Cup tie against Grimsby earlier this season, and followed that up with a Premier League bow, when he replaced Willian from the bench in March's 4-0 dismissal of Everton.  And after impressing manager Frank Lampard with his displays, he has signed professional terms that will keep him at Stamford Bridge until 2025. Congratulations, Tino!       ? "It   s a brilliant feeling," he told the Chelsea website. "I   ve been at the club since I was six years old so to get to this stage and then be offered another five-year contract on top of that is amazing. I had no hesitation but to take it straight away because to play for the club I always dreamed of playing for is really special for me." Anjorin follows in the footsteps of Tammy Abraham, Mason Mount, Fikayo Tomori, Reece James and Billy Gilmour in making his Chelsea breakthrough this season, as manager Lampard and his coaching team have leaned heavily on the club's prolific youth academy.  "It   s been a really crucial season for young players here,    Anjorin added.  "Frank, Jody Morris and Joe Edwards have taken us on board and really committed themselves to bringing young players through. "It   s been really important to have those familiar faces around,    he said of the former Academy coaches who are now working alongside Lampard.    It   s easy to talk to people and be around the first team building more because you   re welcomed in.
