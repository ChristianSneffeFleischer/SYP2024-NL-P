Axel Tuanzebe is set to join Aston Villa on loan, but not before he signs a one-year contract extension with Manchester United.   Tuanzebe has been a bit-part player at Old Trafford over the past two seasons, making just 29 appearances in all competitions. When he has played he has looked solid, with an impressive Champions League display against Paris Saint-Germain back in October 2020 the highlight.   The centre-back's current contract is set to expire next summer and although United have an option to extend this by another year, they were keen to tie him down for even longer. According to The Athletic they have now done this, with Tuanzebe expected to pen terms until 2023 soon with United retaining the option to extend that by a further 12 months. As soon as the deal is signed the defender is expected to depart for Villa on loan. Tuanzebe is no stranger to the club having spent the 2018/2019 season at Villa Park. During that spell he helped his side secure Championship promotion through the playoffs, making 35 appearances in total including both legs of the semi-final and the final itself.
