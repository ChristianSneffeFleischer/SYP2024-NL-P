Manchester United have announced an agreement is in place to sign Casemiro from Real Madrid, subject to personal terms, a medical and UK visa requirement. United are set to pay    60m ( £51m) plus up to a further    10m in add-ons for the five-time Champions League winner.  And while there is no formal agreement on personal terms, a four-year contract worth up to  £400,000 per week - including bonuses - has been hammered out in principle. Casemiro's eagerness for a new challenge after nearly a decade in Madrid has been a factor in the move, which has materialised quickly this week. Despite Real coach Carlo Ancelotti respecting the player's wishes, he did question why Casemiro has chosen to leave the Bernabeu and move to a United side currently struggling.    I can't answer as to why Casemiro would trade the European champions for a struggling side, it's his personal decision," Ancelotti said. United have been crying out for a new central midfielder in recent months, having targeting both Frenkie de Jong and Adrien Rabiot during the summer transfer window. The pursuit of Rabiot collapsed over the player's wage demands, while De Jong remains a target.
