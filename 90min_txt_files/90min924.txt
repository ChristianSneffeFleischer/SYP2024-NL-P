Any club that signs Tottenham striker Harry Kane this summer would be one that 'doesn   t care about value for money' according to the leader of Liverpool's transfer analysis team, Dr Ian Graham. Kane is set to enter the final 12 months of his contract with Spurs this summer and has attracted serious interest from Manchester United and Real Madrid, although 90min understands chairman Daniel Levy has made it clear he has no intentions of selling his star striker this summer regardless of how much money is offered. Even if Levy could be convinced to sell Kane, it would take an enormous transfer fee which would put Kane among the most expensive players in history - the sort of deal which Graham, Liverpool's director of research, believes would be a huge risk. Asked which club will end up signing Kane this summer, Graham told the Cheltenham Science Festival: "A club that doesn   t care about value for money." Graham added: "He   s 29. It   s going to be a high transfer fee for three years of performance that might start declining. feed "From a data point of view, it   s magnificent the way Alex Ferguson constructed a team that was ageing just as he left [Manchester United]. It really did cement his legacy." Kane has been told he will not be sold this summer as Spurs still hope to convince the striker to sign a contract extension next season before he is able to leave the club on a free transfer.  Graham, who will leave Liverpool this summer after 11 years as part of the club's transfer analysis team, also took the time to crush any slim hopes the Reds may have of landing long-time social media target Kylian Mbappe. "Unfortunately, financially, out of Liverpool   s league," he said of the Paris Saint-Germain forward.
