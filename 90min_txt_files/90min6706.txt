Tottenham have offered Jan Vertonghen a one-month contract extension - so he can see out the remainder of the Premier League season - but have no intention of committing to a longer deal. The 33-year-old's current agreement expires on 30 June, but with games scheduled to be played until the end of next month, the Belgian will need to pen fresh terms if he is to complete the campaign.  There are numerous players in a similar position and the Premier League have set a deadline of 23 June for any necessary contract extensions.  Vertonghen has been ever present in the Spurs line up when not injured this season, making 26 appearances in all competitions. However, according to Belgian outlet Nieuwsblad, he may reject Tottenham's offer.  The former Ajax man hopes to earn a contract elsewhere and wants to maximise his chances of securing a summer move by avoiding injury.  Injuries have been a hot topic of the Project Restart negotiations with various clubs concerned that the lack of preparation time prior to football's return could lead to all manner of fitness issues.  Chelsea have written to the Premier League to formally request an increase in the size of the substitutes bench from seven to nine players in order to combat this problem, while managers will also be allowed to make five changes for the first time ever.
