Serge Aurier has turned down the opportunity to move to Wolves as part of the deal Tottenham are concluding to bring Matt Doherty to north London. Dublin-born Doherty is closing in on a move to Jose Mourinho's side for a fee in the region of  £15m, where he would become their third signing of the summer.  first 45 min see you tomorrow ?work???

In an effort to lower the outright fee for Doherty, Spurs offered to send Aurier in part exchange, but as per the Daily Star, the right-back rejected this opportunity as he favours a move to Europe when his Tottenham stay comes to an end. Signed for  £23m in the summer of 2017, Aurier has been the subject of a bid from AC Milan this window, although Spurs turned down the undisclosed offer. It is thought the two clubs are some way apart in their valuation of the 27-year-old, but Milan are likely to return with a revised bid. Bayer Leverkusen are also keeping tracks on Aurier's future ahead of a potential move, with his  £70k-per-week salary not thought to be a stumbling blocks for interested parties. Despite rejecting the chance to move to Molineux, Doherty's ten-year stay with Wolves is expected to come to an imminent end, with an announcement of his move to Tottenham due shortly.
