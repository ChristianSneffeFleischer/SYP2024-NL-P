Newcastle manager Steve Bruce has insisted that fan favourite winger Allan Saint-Maximin is    100%    staying at the club this summer, despite speculation linking the Frenchman with a big money transfer to Everton before the end of the transfer window. Bruce   s greater focus is on ensuring that Saint-Maximin will remain fit, having missed a lot of games last season through injury. The 24-year-old, who is under contract at St James    Park until 2026, is an electric game-changer when at his best.    You can never say never but absolutely, 100%, I will say that we are keeping him,    Bruce is quoted as saying by the Daily Mirror.    I said when I walked through the door two years ago, and he did too, that the supporters will enjoy watching him.    Whether you   re a Newcastle fan or not he   s worth his admission fee alone, isn   t he? In terms of his trickery, pace and power, he   s such a natural footballer.    He gave us that threat we saw at the back end of last season. Let   s hope we can keep him fit. He missed the best part of four and a half months last season. I think he   s only played three 90 minutes in a year, so it   s vital that we keep him fit and well because we know what he gives us.    Newcastle are the only Premier League club yet to make a first-team signing, but the Magpies are waiting on a decision from Joe Willock about a permanent transfer to St James    Park. Willock   s goals from midfield in the second half of last season helped Newcastle avoid a relegation battle and the club have been keen to have him back on Tyneside this season. 90min revealed earlier this month that Newcastle have already agreed a deal with Arsenal, one that could be worth up to  Â£25m including add-ons and therefore exceeding the initial summer budget, but Willock himself still needs to make his mind up about what he wants to do.
