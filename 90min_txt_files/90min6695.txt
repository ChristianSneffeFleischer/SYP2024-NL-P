Manchester United are 'looking to sign' Bayer Leverkusen star Kai Havertz, joining every other giant of European football in pursuit of the talented 20-year-old. Havertz enjoyed a stunning breakthrough campaign last season, hitting 20 goals in all competitions, and has found himself in a rich vein of form since the Bundesliga resumed, with five goals in four appearances. His performances have caught the attention of seemingly every top European club, with Chelsea, Barcelona, Liverpool and Bayern Munich all linked with the midfielder. According to Sport Bild journalist Christian Falk, Manchester United are looking to sign Havertz. Falk took to Twitter to confirm the rumours by replying 'true' and adding a winking emoji to a @utdreport claim that the Red Devils were interested in Havertz. Now you just need Jadon Sancho to sip some water to seal the deal. Havertz is one of the most sought after stars in world football, with Leverkusen slapping a  Â£100m price tag on the youngster's head. True ? https://t.co/GtqMM5WG66 Bayern Munich have long been the favourites to land the 20-year-old, with the German champions long having a history of cherry picking the very best Bundesliga talent - and they are reportedly Havertz's preferred option. However, Havertz has since said that he has ambitions to play abroad, sparking speculation that a Premier League club could be his next destination. Liverpool have frequently been linked with a move for the German midfielder, but the chances of the Reds spending lavishly in the summer have been made even slimmer by the coronavirus outbreak. However, the coronavirus pandemic may not have dented Manchester United's plans of a summer spending spree, with reports claiming they were 'leading the race' for Havertz emerging on Monday.
