Liverpool midfielder Fabinho has undergone a medical with Saudi Arabian side Al Ittihad after the two clubs resolved their concerns over the structure of his proposed  £40m transfer. Al Ittihad targeted Fabinho earlier this month and quickly reached an agreement over personal terms with the Brazilian, who was left out of Liverpool's pre-season tour of Germany after admitting his desire to leave the club. While a verbal agreement was reached over a  £40m fee, the two clubs later failed to agree upon the structure of Al Ittihad's payment, and the negotiations took so long that Fabinho actually returned to training with Jurgen Klopp's side. However, Fabinho was again left out of the group that travelled to Singapore for the second half of pre-season and 90min understands the midfielder is inching closer to finally sealing his move away from Anfield. A formal agreement over payment terms has been reached with Liverpool, who granted Fabinho permission to undergo a medical ahead of his eventual exit. feed Fabinho is set to become the second Liverpool midfielder to swap Merseyside for the Middle East after Jordan Henderson completed his move to Al Ettifaq, currently managed by Reds legend Steven Gerrard. A  £43m signing from Monaco in 2018, Fabinho had a slow start to life in England but soon established himself as one of the top midfielders around. He has managed 219 appearances for Liverpool in all competitions and has won the Premier League, Champions League, FA Cup, Carabao Cup, Community Shield, Club World Cup and Super Cup during his time at Anfield. Fabinho is set to become the fourth blockbuster addition to Al Ittihad, following Karim Benzema, N'Golo Kante and Jota in sealing moves to the reigning Saudi champions.
