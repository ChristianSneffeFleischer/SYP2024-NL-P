Wolves have completed the signing of striker Sasa Kalajdzic from Stuttgart on a permanent basis. The 25-year-old Austrian, who stands at 6'7, had attracted interest from a number of sides across Europe, with Manchester United among those to have considered Kalajdzic earlier in the summer window. However, he has opted to take his talents to Molineux, putting pen to paper on a five-year deal which includes the option for a sixth. 90min understands Wolves have parted with around    22m ( Â£18.9m) to get the deal done. Wolves technical director Scott Sellars said:    We are very happy to secure the signing of Sasa, who is a talented young striker, has many excellent attributes to his game and fits the profile that we have been looking for this summer.
