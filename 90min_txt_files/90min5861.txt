Manchester City have accepted they may only be able to sign Barcelona forward Lionel Messi on a free transfer, leading to manager Pep Guardiola urging Messi to stay at Camp Nou. City have emerged as the leading candidate to sign Messi, who has asked to leave Bar  a and believes he has triggered a clause in his contract which now makes him a free agent - something Barcelona dispute. La Liga took the side of Bar  a in this debate, insisting Messi's contract is still valid and the only way he can force his way out of the club is if his  £624m release clause is triggered, which obviously isn't happening. There were reports that City could launch a  £250m players-plus-cash bid to try and get an agreement over the line, but according to Mundo Deportivo, the Citizens have accepted that paying any money for Messi would blow their budget apart. When the Argentine's wage demands are factored into the equation, City know that shelling out a hefty transfer fee would do more harm to their team than good - many high earners would likely have to be sold - so they are prepared to give up on signing Messi if he is not available for free. Guardiola returned to Manchester on Monday after a brief spell in Barcelona, during which it is understood he spoke to Messi over the phone, but the boss confessed that the financial difficulties of signing Messi will likely make this one too difficult to pull off. He told the Argentine that he would be better off rebuilding his relationship with Bar  a and ending his career at Camp Nou - something he has publicly stated plenty of times in the past. Having said that, City will continue to monitor the situation closely. Messi is expected to take Barcelona to court over his desire to terminate his contract, and if he ends up being successful, City are prepared to pounce.
