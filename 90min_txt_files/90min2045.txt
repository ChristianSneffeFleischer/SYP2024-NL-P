Endrick has admitted that he opted to join Real Madrid to follow in the footsteps of two of his favourite players, Cristiano Ronaldo and Vinicius Junior. The 16-year-old Palmeiras striker has put pen to paper of a move to Real in 2024 which will cost Los Blancos a cool    72m, with Endrick rejecting advances from the likes of Barcelona, Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain to head to Madrid. 90min revealed in March 2022 that Endrick had voiced his preference to join Real and, after listening to the proposals on offer across Europe, the teenager eventually followed his heart and has now explained why. "Real Madrid are a very big team, and Vini has sent me messages to give me more hope," he told Marca. "Cristiano too, my idol, played for Real Madrid. That's why I chose Real Madrid and I think it's the right choice. God has always been with me and he told me that this is the best path." Asked just what Vinicius had told him, Endrick said: "Several tips. I couldn't even say them here because there have been a lot of them. I'd be here for a long time. I'll keep them to myself. "But he has not given me advice just for now, but for my whole life. He is my friend and I think this friendship will last for many years. I hope I can exchange a lot of assists with him and score goals too." While FIFA rules prevent Endrick from moving to Real until 2024, the teenager insisted he will be cheering Los Blancos on every day until he eventually makes his way to the Santiago Bernabeu.
