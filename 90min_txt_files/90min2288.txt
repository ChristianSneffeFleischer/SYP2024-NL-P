Tottenham Hotspur had officials in attendance to watch forwards Marcus Thuram and Youssoufa Moukoko duel in Friday's clash between Borussia Monchengladbach and Borussia Dortmund, 90min understands. Monchengladbach ran out 4-2 winners at Borussia Park as the two sides closed up their Bundesliga seasons ahead of the World Cup break with a thriller. 90min revealed last week that Spurs are on the hunt for a new forward in the January transfer window, with Thuram and Moukoko on their list of targets. Thuram scored Monchengladbach's third goal of the evening, taking his tally in the Bundesliga to ten for the season. He has since been named in Didier Deschamps' France squad for the World Cup. The 25-year-old's deal at Monchengladbach expires at the end of the season and will be able to negotiate free transfers with clubs from January onwards, with north London rivals Arsenal also admirers of him. Moukoko, who only turns 18 later this month and is also out of contract in 2023, is also of interest to Spurs, though he has been linked with pretty much all of Europe's elite clubs in recent months, including Real Madrid and Barcelona.
