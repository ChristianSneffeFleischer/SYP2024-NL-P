An assortment of sides of shown an interest in snapping up the 32-year-old on a free transfer, with former Chelsea manager Maurizio Sarri reportedly keen on a reunion at Juventus. However, Roma have remained in pole position, and according to Goal, discussions between Pedro and the Serie A side have been edging towards a conclusion in the last 48 hours. The pair have been in negotiations since April, with Roma reported to have tabled a contract offer worth in the region of  Â£3m per year. The coronavirus outbreak has triggered financial uncertainty across football, and if Roma are successful in snapping up Pedro on a free transfer, it could pan out to be one of the bargains of the summer.

In England, Newcastle had been mooted as a possible destination with their impending Saudi-backed takeover giving them a cash injection, although that talk has since faded.  #Repost     @chelseafc     A message from @_pedro17_: Please keep calm, stay at home, stay isolated, because this virus can really be quite dangerous and hard to control.

The winger has fallen down the pecking order at Stamford Bridge since Frank Lampard's appointment last summer.
