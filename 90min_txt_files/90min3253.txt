Chelsea are among those to have recently held talks with the representatives of Ajax winger Antony, 90min understands, although the Brazilian is a key transfer target for Manchester United. Antony has risen to prominence during his two years in Amsterdam, breaking into the Brazil squad and registering double figures for both goals and assists in 2021/22. The manager who oversaw the 22-year-old's emergence at Ajax, Erik ten Hag, has of course taken over at Man Utd, and 90min revealed earlier this week that the wide man is the Red Devils' primary attacking target this summer, with talks held over a transfer when the player's agents were in England a few weeks ago. Indeed, Antony has signalled that he would like to move on from the Johan Cruyff Arena in the summer. However, United could face competition from Premier League rivals Chelsea. Sources have told 90min that their representatives also met with Antony's agents while they were visiting the UK recently. The London club have been monitoring the Brazilian's situation since in their ongoing search for attacking reinforcements. Man City star Raheem Sterling and Barcelona contract rebel Ousmane Dembele are also targets. Listen now to 90min's Talking Transfers podcast, with Scott Saunders, Graeme Bailey, Harry Symeou & Toby Cudworth. On the latest show they discuss Newcastle's decision to pull out of a deal for Hugo Ekitike and offer the latest on Arsenal's pursuit of Gabriel Jesus. Available on all audio platforms and the 90min YouTube channel. Having been quietly confident of signing the Frenchman on a free transfer, Chelsea are now waiting on the outcome of fresh contract talks between Barcelona and Dembele - which came at the behest of head coach Xavi - although 90min understands a new deal at Camp Nou is by no means a given.
