Weston McKennie is due at Leeds on Sunday for a medical ahead of his transfer from Juventus after the two clubs agreed terms, 90min understands. Leeds' confidence of signing the USA international has grown in recent days, with the player and club finalising personal terms. McKennie made it clear Leeds were his first choice despite talks with other Premier League sides and he is due to link up with compatriots Jesse Marsch, Brenden Aaronson and Tyler Adams in West Yorkshire. McKennie will join Marsch's side for an initial  £1m loan with a  £29m option for a permanent transfer. That option will become an obligation if certain conditions are met. 24-year-old McKennie joined Juve after coming through the ranks at Schalke but has largely struggled for the Italian giants. He made 65 appearances for the club in total, scoring eight goals and winning the Coppa Italia and Supercoppa Italiana.
