West Ham are reportedly in talks with Jack Wilshere to terminate the midfielder's contract early, as the Irons look to free up space on their wage bill for new signings.  Wilshere joined the club on a free transfer back in 2018, but injuries have restricted him to a minor role in the squad, and he made just eight appearances last season - two of which coming from the bench post-lockdown.  Previous reports on the club's plans for the 28-year-old have conflicted. In March, it was claimed that the club weren't yet considering offloading him, yet last month, The Times reported the exact opposite - that they want him gone so badly they are prepared to top up his wages for his first year with a new team.  Work hard in silence and be ready for whatever happens next ??

It's said that clearing room on the wage bill is the priority for West Ham, who want to create some wiggle room for manager David Moyes. According to Spotrac, their  £51m annual bill is the 10th highest in the Premier League, and dwarves the likes of Wolves ( £28m), Brighton ( £23m), Newcastle ( £22m), and Burnley ( £17m) - all of whom finished above them in the division last season.  On more than  £5m per year, Wilshere is their second highest earner, so releasing him would undoubtedly create space to add to the squad. The permanent acquisition of Tomas Soucek is their only signing of the window so far, with the league season kicking off this weekend.    More minutes ??
