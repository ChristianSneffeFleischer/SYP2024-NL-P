Preston centre back Ben Davies is on the verge of signing for Liverpool after the two clubs agreed a deal in the region of  Â£2m. With just six months left on his contract, the defender had previously attracted interest from the likes of Celtic, Bournemouth and Rangers but the Reds look to have swooped in to add some much needed depth to their defensive ranks. But who is the man in question? Here's everything you need to know about Ben Davies... Davies is an academy graduate at Preston North End, having joined the club aged 11. He progressed through every level and captained the academy team before making his debut for the first team aged 17. Despite coming through the academy at Preston, Davies has played in every tier of England's football pyramid except for the Premier League.He represented Southport on loan in the National League, Tranmere, York and Newport County in League Two, Fleetwood Town in League One and Preston in the Championship. The only way is up. After one of his many loan moves, Davies returned to Preston and was installed as the first choice left back.Since then he has transitioned into a central defender where he has played every game this season, but he's still got the legs to fill in at full back if needs be.
