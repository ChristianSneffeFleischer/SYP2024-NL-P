Aston Villa are close to finalising a deal with Galatasaray for Italy international Nicolo Zaniolo, sources have confirmed to 90min. The 24-year-old attacker only moved to Turkey in February after a January transfer from Roma to Bournemouth collapsed. Instead, he signed a four-and-half-year deal with the Istanbul giants. Zaniolo helped Gala to their first Turkish Super Lig title in four years by scoring five goals in ten league games, but now he is set to leave the club just six months after arriving. Villa have been looking to find a replacement for the injured Emi Buendia and Zaniolo has been picked out by president of football operations Monchi and head coach Unai Emery. Indeed, Emery has already spoken about the qualities of Zaniolo and what he coud bring to his side.  feed "Zaniolo is not a striker. He is versatile," the boss said. "He can play as a striker, a number seven or a number 10 and he is one of those on our list, with the qualities he has, to help us."
