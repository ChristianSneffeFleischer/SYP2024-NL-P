Newcastle United have started working on deals to sign defenders this summer and are looking to land a full-back and centre-half, 90min understands. Newcastle are wasted little time in pursuing midfield and attacking options this transfer window, with Milan's Sandro Tonali set to sign and talks ongoing with Leicester over James Maddison. But defensive reinforcements have always been high on their agenda. They want a new right-sided centre-half to compete with Fabian Schar, while another full-back is wanted as well. A left-back was ideally the target but Newcastle are now looking at players who can fill in on either side. 90min understands that has led them to Southampton, where talks have taken place over both Kyle Walker-Peters and Tino Livramento. Both are on the market following the Saints' relegation from the Premier League, but it is understood that Newcastle are pushing harder for 20-year-old Livramento. Newcastle are believed to have entered talks valuing him at around  £15m, but sources have told 90min that Southampton are looking at closer to  £30m for the former Chelsea man. feed In terms of centre-backs, 90min understands  that Newcastle are looking closely at Crystal Palace pair Marc  Guehi and Joachim Andersen. England international Guehi has shone for Palace since joining from Chelsea, although an asking price of over  £50m means a deal this summer for Newcastle looks tough given the number of positions they are looking to improve upon. Andersen   s price tag is more likely to be less than  £30m and it is believed he is a more realistic target for Newcastle at this stage, although the Magpies are still looking at numerous options.
