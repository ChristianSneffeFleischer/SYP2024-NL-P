Normal order has been resumed in the Bundesliga. There may have been a few sticky games for Bayern Munich, but they still sit at the top of Germany's top flight heading into the winter break. The Bavarian giants may have arguably the best squad in European football, but that doesn't mean a few positions can't be bolstered by some incoming signings. Back on top of the table! ?#FCBayern #MiaSanMia pic.twitter.com/M8YECP2Pww With the club unlikely to finance any mega bucks signings, manager Hansi Flick may have to look for cheaper alternatives, but also ones that fit his pressing style. Let's check out what the German champions should be getting up to in January. Perisic was a very useful player in the treble-winning side last season during his loan spell from Inter and would be a very safe option.Flick knows the player, and more importantly knows that he can work effectively in Bayern's system.Having fallen short of Inter's valuation of the Croatian by    3m with their    12m offer in September, the loan deal was not made permanent. Managing only two goals in 19 games for Antonio Conte's side this season, might he be missing playing for the German champions? Yeah, most probably. Though the dream transfer of Erling Haaland currently looks unlikely given Karl-Heinz Rummenigge's comments on Bayern's finances, a back-up for their star man should be a priority.Lewandowski continues to show the world that he ages like a fine wine, being crowned Best FIFA Men's Player of the Year earlier this month. However, he's 32 and reaching the end of his career, and Bayern could do with easing his goalscoring burden.Borussia Monchengladbach's Marcus Thuram would offer just that. The 23-year-old scored ten goals last season and looks like he fits the mould for a Bayern Munich player.
