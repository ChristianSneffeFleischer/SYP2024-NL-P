Middlesbrough are closing in on the signing of United States international goalkeeper Zack Steffen, with the player due to undergo a medical on Friday, 90min understands. As reported by 90min, Boro agreed a deal to bring Steffen to the Riverside Stadium on loan at the end of June, with Man City already striking an agreement with Arminia Bielefeld's Stefan Ortega to come on board as their new back-up to Ederson.  Boro have conducted a long search for a new starting goalkeeper to help strengthen their promotion bid next season, with the likes of Tom Heaton, Karl Darlow, and Ben Foster all considered among others.  But the north east club settled on Steffen and after winning the race to agree a deal for the American, will now oversee a medical on Friday ahead of completing the transfer. Capped 29 times for the USMNT, Steffen joined Man City from the Columbus Crew in MLS in 2019, spending a season on loan with Fortuna Dusseldorf before backing up Ederson for Pep Guardiola's side.
