Bayern Munich CEO Oliver Kahn has confirmed the Bundesliga side will not be signing Cristiano Ronaldo on a free transfer. During the summer, Bayern were one of a handful of suitors who publicly rejected the chance to move for Ronaldo, who has since been released from his contract with Manchester United after his bombshell interview. Ronaldo is now looking for a new club but, as 90min reported earlier this month, Bayern have no interest in pursuing the veteran striker. "I can rule out a move for Ronaldo," Kahn told Sky Germany. "We considered it, it's our duty. We all love Ronaldo but we have a different strategy. We have a clear idea, a clear philosophy of how our squad should be put together."
