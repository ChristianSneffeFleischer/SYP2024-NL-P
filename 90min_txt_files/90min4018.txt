Philadelphia Union manager Jim Curtin has revealed Jamiro Monteiro is in talks for a transfer away from the club. The eight-time Cape Verde international has been one of the Union's most important players in recent years, notching seven goals and 12 assists in 50 MLS appearances since the start of 2019. Operating at the tip of Curtin's diamond midfield, Monteiro provides Philadelphia with drive and creativity, while he's also an extremely effective presser. But Monteiro was a shock omission from Curtin's lineup for the Union's 1-1 draw with Chicago Fire on Sunday afternoon and he was sorely missed out on the field, with the home side struggling to break down a stubborn defence. Asked about his absence by reporters after the match, Curtin - who has already seen the likes of Brenden Aaronson and Mark McKenzie depart his squad in the last 12 months - admitted Monteiro is in talks to leave the club.    Jamiro is in transfer talks right now,    Curtin said (via Brotherly Game).    That   s all I can say about the matter.    Monteiro has been linked with Anderlecht and Dutch giants Feyenoord. What's more, according to The Inquirer's Jonathan Tannenwald, the 27-year-old is seeking an exit due to personal reasons, having been unable to see his family since June. Monteiro was born in Rotterdam and had spells in Dutch football with Cambuur and Heracles prior to his MLS switch. Carlos Barros, Monteiro   s agent, has also revealed (via The Philly Soccer Page) interest from a "top Brazilian team", as well as a Western Conference MLS side. A source with knowledge of the situation tells The Inquirer that Jamiro Monteiro's family hasn't been able to come to the U.S. this summer. He hasn't been with them since June.That's what it's about, I suspect.
