Felipe Anderson is poised for a deadline day West Ham exit, with Porto in advanced talks to sign the attacking midfielder on loan. West Ham's record signing is yet to hit the heights expected of him following his  £36m move from Lazio in July 2018, and has played just two minutes of Premier League football across two substitute cameos this season. According to journalist Fabrizio Romano, Porto are in advanced talks to sign the Brazilian from West Ham. His claim is supported by TalkSport, who report that the Portuguese outfit are keen to take Anderson to the Est  dio do Drag £o on a temporary basis, with talks ongoing between the two sides. The 27-year-old pockets a reported  £85,000 per week at the London Stadium, meaning a loan deal would likely free up some of the wage bill - but whether West Ham would be able to take advantage of this before the transfer deadline remains to be seen. The Hammers have been linked with Brentford's Said Benrahma throughout the summer, as have Premier League rivals Aston Villa and Crystal Palace. Benrahma was left out of the Brentford starting XI for their defeat to Preston on Sunday - which Thomas Frank insists was due to fitness and not transfer activity.
