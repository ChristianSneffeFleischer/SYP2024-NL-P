Fabinho says the Liverpool squad "know how good" summer signings Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai and admitted the position has needed reinforcing during recent years. The Reds' midfield was picked apart at points in the 2022/23 season as Jurgen Klopp's side missed out on Champions League qualification. However, they have moved quickly to sign their top transfer targets early in the window. Mac Allister and Szoboszlai both boast considerable goal threat which few Liverpool midfielders could match last season and Fabinho says the quality of depth will help his side regain their former level. "We lost, I think, three midfield players that were really important for us in the last maybe five, six years. It's good to bring some good players in that position because we will need [them]. "In the way we play, the intensity we play, we always need not just three or four but maybe six players in this position [in the squad]. feed "So yes, it's good to have these two players with us now. We played against them already, so we know how good they are. It's good to have them in the team. "Sometimes we will lose some very good friends. That's the case with Bobby [Firmino]; he's gone, so I wish him and his family all the best.    We have to focus on the players that we have now. At the moment, Mac Allister and Szoboszlai have arrived. I didn't see them yet, they have a couple more days of holidays. "We just hope that they will be ready to be with us. We will help them in the adaptation and hope they will be ready and get the ideas of the team as quick as possible." World Cup winner Mac Allister has plenty of Premier League experience after breaking into the Seagulls side under Graham Potter, while Szoboszlai faced Liverpool twice in the 2019/20 Champions League group stages.
