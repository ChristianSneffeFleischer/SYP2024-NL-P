Chelsea head coach Thomas Tuchel has asked the club to test Real Madrid's resolve over Eder Militao this summer. The Blues are expected to be on the hunt for defensive reinforcements, with 90min revealing last month that they are fearful of losing Antonio Rudiger, Andreas Christensen and Cesar Azpilicueta on free transfers at the end of the season. We also understand that Chelsea will push hard again to sign Sevilla centre-back Jules Kounde, while reports in Spain suggest they have another La Liga target in their sights. AS write that Tuchel is a fan of Real and Brazil star Militao, who has emerged as a key player at the Santiago Bernabeu this term following the departures of Sergio Ramos and Raphael Varane. Having made a combined 41 appearances in his first two years in Spain, Militao has played 30 times so far this campaign. The Chelsea hierarchy are also long-term admirers of Militao having tried to sign him from Porto before their transfer ban kicked in back in 2019 - he ended up joining Real for    50m, the most the club had ever spent on a defender.
