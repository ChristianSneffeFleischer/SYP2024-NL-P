Brighton midfielder Moises Caicedo has insisted he remains solely focused on the Seagulls despite interest from a number of Premier League sides. Chelsea - and former Brighton boss Graham Potter - are incredibly keen on the Ecuador international but have already seen an initial enquiry knocked back, with sources confirming to 90min that Brighton have no desire to part ways with Caicedo. The Seagulls are sixth in the Premier League, ahead of most of the sides interested in Caicedo. With life at Brighton going pretty well right now, the midfielder insisted he remains solely focused on his current club.    I am focused on Brighton,    he told club media.    I am here, I   m playing every day. Things from outside don   t trouble me, nor does it take that focus away because I   m focussed only on here.    I handle [the speculation] well. You hear rumours here and there, but I only try to be focused on the club where I am now, the club which opened the doors for me to be playing every week.
