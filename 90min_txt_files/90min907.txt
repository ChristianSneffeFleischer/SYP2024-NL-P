Aston Villa have confirmed they will sign Youri Tielemans on a free transfer once his contract expires later this summer. The Belgium international ran down his contract with Leicester as they suffered relegation to the Championship. He joins a Villans side that qualified for the Europa Conference League after a mid-season turnaround under incoming manager Unai Emery. A club statement reads: "Aston Villa is delighted to announce that the club has reached an agreement to sign Youri Tielemans. "The Belgian international will officially become a Villan on July 1 after his contract with Leicester City has expired."
