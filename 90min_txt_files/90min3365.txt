Manchester United have been offered the chance to sign Barcelona full-back Sergino Dest, 90min understands. The 21-year-old, who joined Bar  afrom Ajax in 2020, has started just six games this year and it is believed he is not seen as a long-term part of Xavi's plans. The Blaugrana even signed veteran Dani Alves on a short-term contract midway through the season, and he is set to pen fresh terms to keep him in Catalunya beyond the summer.  Now, 90min understands that Dest has been told that he can look for a new club, and intermediaries are working hard to get him out of Bar  a. One of the first clubs contacted was United, who have been long-term admirers of the American. New boss Erik ten Hag is considering bringing in a new right-back, with many at the club unconvinced by not only Aaron Wan-Bissaka but also Diogo Dalot. Although the position is not a priority for Ten Hag, he does have an interest in a possible deal for Dest - a player who came through at Ajax under him and flourished. Listen now to 90min's brand new podcast, Talking Transfers, with Scott Saunders, Graeme Bailey & Toby Cudworth. This week they discuss Man Utd's plans for Cristiano Ronaldo under Erik ten Hag, plus what his stay could mean for United's transfer plans. There's talk on Kylian Mbappe's impending move to Real Madrid, Robert Lewandowski leaving Bayern, Raphinha to Barcelona and Steven Gerrard targeting Luis Suarez. United are believed to be open to loaning Wan-Bissaka out, which has already piqued the interest of his former club Crystal Palace, but others around the Premier League and Europe are keen. That could tee up a possible loan for Dest - if United do not want a permanent deal this summer. 90min are told that whilst Bar  a would rather sell, they would consider a temporary move.
