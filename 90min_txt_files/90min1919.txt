Chelsea have identified Sporting CP defender Pedro Porro as a potential option at right-back, sources have told 90min. The 23-year-old has enjoyed an impressive season since signing for the Portuguese giants on a permanent transfer from Manchester City last summer following an earlier loan. He notably put in two solid displays against Tottenham in the Champions League, with 90min recently reporting that Spurs have held talks with Sporting about a deal for the Spaniard. But Tottenham are not alone in their admiration of Porro. Sources have told 90min that Chelsea are also intent on adding cover at right-back this month and have sounded out Porro as a target. But the Blues have encountered the same stumbling block as Tottenham, with Sporting refusing to negotiate and insisting any interested club would have to pay his    45m release clause to sign him.
