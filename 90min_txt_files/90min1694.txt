Manchester United have struck a deal to sign Cardiff City striker Gabriele Biancheri. The 16-year-old has been prolific at youth level and is understood to have trained with Cardiff's Under-21 side already, having made his debut for the Under-18s earlier this season. A number of top sides are understood to have expressed an interest in signing Biancheri, who is not yet eligible to sign a professional contract, but United have forced their way to the front of the queue to get a deal over the line. The Wales youth international, who is also eligible to represent both England and Italy, has already undergone a medical with United and has agreed the terms of a professional contract which will be signed when Biancheri turns 17 in September. As a youth signing, Biancheri's move to United does not need to be confirmed before the winter transfer window shuts but the Red Devils were keen to finalise the teenager's arrival to ensure they did not miss out on his signing. Leaving the European Union has left UK clubs limited in their options when it comes to youth recruitment, with foreign players not permitted to move until they turn 18.
