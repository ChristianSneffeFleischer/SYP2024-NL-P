The boyhood club of new Chelsea signing David Datro Fofana attempted to block his recent transfer to Stamford Bridge. The Blues completed the signing of the 20-year-old from Norwegian side Molde on Saturday for a fee believed to be in the region of  Â£8m. But Fofana's boyhood side in his native Ivory Coast, Abidjan City, wrote to FIFA complaining that his initial deal to leave the country for Molde was unlawful. Fofana departed for Norway at the age of 15 and there is confusion over whether his mother signed the necessary consent forms to allow a legal transfer. In Abidjan City's letter to FIFA, club president Marco Taddei wrote: "We, therefore, invite you to intervene with the Chelsea club so that the player   s transfer is suspended until the dispute between the Molde FK club and ourselves is settled."
