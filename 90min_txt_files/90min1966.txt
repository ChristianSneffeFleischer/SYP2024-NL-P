Manchester United have confirmed the signing of Crystal Palace goalkeeper Jack Butland on loan until the end of the season.  The Red Devils had been on the lookout for a backup goalkeeper after Martin Dubravka was recalled from his loan deal early by parent club Newcastle United.  90min confirmed earlier this week that talks had been ongoing between United and Butland's representatives, and now a deal has finally been ironed out.  Speaking to the club's official website after making the move, Butland said:    This is an amazing club and one that I am now proud to represent. I   m really looking forward to working with an unbelievable goalkeeping group, supporting each other every day to create the best training and playing environment for the team.
