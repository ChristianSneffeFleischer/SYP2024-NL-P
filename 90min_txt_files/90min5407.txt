West Ham United are closing in on a deal to bring Brentford star Said Benrahma to the Premier League, with the two clubs working towards a transfer fee which could eventually rise to within the region of  £30m.  The 25-year-old produced a brilliant season of football for the Bees last year, lifting them to within one win of the Premier League. Thomas Frank's side ultimately suffered play-off final heartbreak, and it felt inevitable that his talented forward line, including now-Aston Villa star Ollie Watkins, would be broken up.  And Sky Sports is now reporting that Premier League outfit West Ham are in advanced talks with Brentford, who could sign Benrahma in a deal rising in value to  £30m. However, Crystal Palace also remain interested in securing the Algerian star's services, as the transfer deadline of October 16 fast approaches.  This comes after 90min exclusively broke the news that the Hammers had made an offer of  £17m plus add-ons for the scintillating winger earlier on Saturday, while Brentford valued the forward closer to the  £25m mark.  It appears that a breakthrough has been reached between the two clubs, which would see Benrahma leave Brentford after only two years at the club. The Bees snapped up the winger from Nice, in a deal believed to be worth a minuscule  £2.7m.
