Leeds United are interested in signing Chelsea outcast Michy Batshuayi, which could hands the Blues a huge boost in their effort to raise additional transfer funds this summer. The former Marseille striker was already way down the pecking order at Stamford Bridge - behind both Olivier Giroud and Tammy Abraham - and the arrival of RB Leipzig striker Timo Werner has almost certainly brought the curtain down on his four-year stay in west London. Leeds manager Marcelo Bielsa already knows the Belgian international well from their time together in France and now, according to the Evening Standard, the Argentine is keen to reunite with Batshuayi again at Elland Road. Batshuayi has had loan spells at Valencia, Borussia Dortmund and Crystal Palace in recent years - to varying levels of success - but with Chelsea head coach Frank Lampard now keen to bolster his defensive line, as well as continuing to pursue Kai Havertz, a permanent move away from the club is now sought. The defeated FA Cup finalists have already spent over  Â£80m on Hakim Ziyech and Werner, so selling fringe players to help balance the books is very much the order of the day. Victor Moses, Tiemoue Bakayoko and Danny Drinkwater are other players in a similar boat. Batshuayi started just one Premier League game during 2019/20, but did still manage to register eight goals and three assists from 24 appearances in all competitions.
