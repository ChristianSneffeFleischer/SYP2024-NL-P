With a surprising golden generation of English players emerging in recent years, there was always likely to be a few who went under the radar. 18-year-old left-back Matthew Bondswell is one of them. One of a number of English players to head to the Bundesliga in search of a fast-track to first-team game time, the RB Leipzig man was sent on loan to the Netherlands in the summer. His performances for second-tier FC Dordrecht have been so impressive that the young defender now looks all but set to join West Ham this January.  Here's everything you need to know about Bondswell... A post shared by Matt Bondswell (@mattbondswell) Bondswell is a Nottingham Forest academy graduate, following in the footsteps of the likes of Michael Dawson, Jermaine Jenas, Matty Cash, Marlon Harewood and Premier League winner Wes Morgan.He joined the club aged eight and spent eight years at the club before moving to Germany to pursue regular football and a new footballing education. An explosive left-back, Bondswell is a modern full-back who is excellent going forward but defensively needs work. Currently he relies a lot on his pace, whether it's offensively or defensively, and he'll be hoping to improve his positioning as he learns his trade.
