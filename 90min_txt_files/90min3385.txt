Aston Villa have offered an initial  £12m to Barcelona for the permanent signing of on-loan midfielder Philippe Coutinho. The Catalans paid over  £140m for the Brazilian and could also field late interest from Newcastle. Barcelona will make up to nine players available for transfer this summer to fund a squad rebuild. That could still include Frenkie de Jong, despite public insistence from Xavi and others that the Dutchman is an important player. West Ham are favourites to sign Arsenal striker Eddie Nketiah, who is out of contract this summer. The Gunners want to tie him down to a new long-term deal but Crystal Palace and Borussia Monchengladbach are also keen on a player who'd had limited chances to play until recently. The Hammers are also likely to renew their interest in Manchester United forward Jesse Lingard. Liverpool are yet to contact Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain about a new contract, leaving the midfielder uncertain of his future amid a lack of playing time. His current deal expires in 2023. Newcastle are preparing to sell up to 10 players before next season as part of a squad transformation. Captain Jamaal Lascelles is among those likely to be available. The Magpies are also interested in tough tackling Tottenham midfielder Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg. Leeds are one of the clubs interested in Chelsea defender Jake Clarke-Salter, who has spent this season on loan at Coventry in the Championship. PSV Eindhoven are another.
