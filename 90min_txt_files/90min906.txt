Real Madrid club president Florentino Perez has admitted that he wants to sign Kylian Mbappe. The French forward has consistently been linked with a move to Los Blancos ever since he made his breakthrough as a teenager with AS Monaco.

The footballing world expected Mbappe to finally join Real Madrid at the end of that season on a free transfer, but in a shock twist, he signed a new contract at Parc des Princes in May 2022.
