Andreas Pereira's proposed permanent move to Flamengo is on hold as the Brazilian club are currently fighting a legal battle in court.  Pereira again left Manchester United on loan in the summer after previous temporary spells at Granada, Valencia and Lazio. The difference this time is that it looked like the Belgian-born forward would be making the switch permanent.  Last month it was widely reported that Flamengo had a verbal agreement in place for Pereira's transfer, but there has been no official confirmation as of yet.  Now, Brazilian news outlet Globo Esporte report that Flamengo are currently in court owing to operations conducted between 1993 and 1998, which has resulted in the blocking of  R$127m - leading club president Rodolfo Landim to halt any new signings for the time being.
