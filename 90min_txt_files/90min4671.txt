Bayern Munich are interested in signing Real Madrid midfielder Federico Valverde, although Los Blancos consider the Uruguayan to be priceless to their future. The 22-year-old was a key figure in their title winning side in the 2019/20 campaign, featuring 33 times over the course of the season, but he has failed to reach those heights for Zinedine Zidane's team this season. Despite his slight dip in form, Valverde is a man in demand. According to Marca, European champions Bayern are keen to sign the Madrid star, although the Spanish giants are not considering selling their dynamic midfielder. Die Roten are still looking to replenish their midfield alternatives, having sold Thiago Alcantara to Liverpool in the summer, while the likes of Corentin Tolisso continue to underperform for the German champions. In fact, Bayern are believed to have tried to sign Valverde last summer, but the youngster was 'untouchable' in Madrid's eyes and they rejected their advances outright. Los Merengues will be encouraged by the player's stance on this potential move. Valverde has shown no interest in leaving Santiago Bernabeu and his sole objective remains rising to prominence in the white jersey of Madrid, where he has already made his name across Europe.
