Manchester City have finally reached an agreement with Chelsea over the transfer of Mateo Kovacic, sources have confirmed to 90min. The Croatia midfielder has one year left to run on his contract at Stamford Bridge and he has been the subject of interest from various Premier League clubs. 90min reported earlier this year that Liverpool and Manchester United were eyeing a summer move for Kovacic. However, Man City soon emerged as the favourites to sign the 29-year-old, with 90min revealing at the beginning of June they had agreed personal terms. And sources have now confirmed that Man City have agreed a deal with Chelsea that will see them pay a fee that could rise to  £30m if add-ons are met. Kovacic will now undertake a medical ahead of sealing his move to the Etihad Stadium. feed He will become the second senior midfielder to leave Chelsea this summer, with N'Golo Kante's move to Saudi Pro League champions Al Ittihad confirmed on Wednesday morning. The Blues could also lose Mason Mount, who like Kovacic is entering the final year of his contract in west London. Man Utd are interested but have had an opening  £40m bid knocked back. Kai Havertz is also expected to leave Chelsea, with Arsenal and Bayern Munich interested in his signature. Meanwhile, Man City are still waiting on Ilkay Gundogan's decision over his future. His deal is up at the end of the month and is the subject of rival interest from Arsenal and Barcelona.
