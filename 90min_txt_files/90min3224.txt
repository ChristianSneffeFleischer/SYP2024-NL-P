Manchester City have confirmed the signing of goalkeeper Stefan Ortega Moreno on a three-year contract.  Aside from a three-year spell with 1860 Munich between 2014 and 2017, Ortega Moreno has spent his entire career at Arminia Bielefeld. He arrives at the Etihad Stadium on a free transfer following the expiration of his contract at the German club.     This is a fantastic move for me,    he said.    Manchester City are an amazing team     a squad with world-class quality in every area. To be given the chance to join this group of players and help continue the Club   s success is a dream for me.    I have enjoyed my time in Germany and I want to thank the Arminia Bielefeld fans for their support. But this new challenge of coming to City and playing in the Premier League is too good for me to ignore.      I can   t wait to get started, meet my teammates and begin working with Pep and his backroom staff.        He added:    I know the style of Pep and I love to see how    play football. I think I have the quality to also show this performance.         I think I am a good teammate and I make a lot of jokes! But on the pitch, I want to win every game. Whether it is a training game or a real game, I am ambitious and I want to reach the top.
