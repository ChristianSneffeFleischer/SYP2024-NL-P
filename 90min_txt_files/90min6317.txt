Borussia Dortmund pulled out all the stops in order to land Birmingham City prodigy Jude Bellingham, with the youngster set to earn roughly    3m ( £2.7m) per year with the German giants.  Despite only recently turning 17, Bellingham has been a regular for Birmingham in 2019/20, making 41 appearances in all competitions - operating primarily as a central midfielder, but also further up the field as well.  The Englishman's displays have led to much interest in his services, with a number of top clubs keen. More specifically, it has been Dortmund and Manchester United who have led the pursuit of Bellingham.
