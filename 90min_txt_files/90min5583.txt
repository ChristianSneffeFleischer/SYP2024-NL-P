Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has hinted the club will not recruit any central defenders in the current window as he is comfortable with the quality and quantity of the players in this position at his disposal. After finishing 33 points behind Premier League champions Liverpool last season, United's only signing of the summer has been attacking midfielder Donny van de Beek. The Red Devils ended the previous campaign with the third-best defensive record in the division, but started the current season with a home defeat to Crystal Palace followed by a narrow victory away to Brighton, conceding five goals in the process. Following United's 3-2 victory on the south coast, Solskjaer defended the squad's depth in the centre-back position, citing the fact that he was able to bring on the experienced defender Eric Bailly alongside his first choice pairing of Victor Lindelof and Harry Maguire. Solskjaer explained as quoted by the Daily Mail: "We've got many defenders here and I put Eric on to bolster the defence, following the runs of [Leandro] Trossard and [Neal] Maupay. For me, we've got enough good centre backs here at the moment. "When you concede chances and concede goals, there are two different things you can look at - it's either the team shape, or are there any individual mistakes.
