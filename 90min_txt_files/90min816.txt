Manchester United midfielder Christian Eriksen believes that compatriot Rasmus Hojlund has the quality to play for the Red Devils. 90min understands that Hojlund is on Man Utd's list of striker targets for the summer transfer window, though Atalanta's asking price of at least    65m could prove to be a stumbling block. Man Utd are looking to bring in two strikers this summer - one ready-made forward with experience and one younger option, with 20-year-old Hojlund falling into the latter category. Eriksen, who joined Man Utd from Brentford on a free transfer last summer, was asked about Hojlund's potential move to Old Trafford prior to Denmark's 1-0 win against Northern Ireland on Friday night. "I can see him [Hojlund] at Manchester United, but I haven't recommended him to Erik ten Hag,    Eriksen said to Ekstra Bladet. "He is a fantastic guy and a good player and has really developed brilliantly at Atalanta. What the club ends up doing, I will not be able to answer." feed Eriksen added: "It's a club where there's a huge amount of attention because everyone has an attitude towards Manchester United. I had tried a lot when I came to the club. So I knew a little bit about what size the club was. "For younger players who come to the club, it can be really difficult, because the club is the size it is now." Hojlund enjoyed a superb debut season with Atalanta having only joined from Austrian side Sturm Graz last summer, registering 10 goals and four assists across 33 games.
