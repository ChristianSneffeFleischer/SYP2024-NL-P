Chelsea plan to send young prodigy Angelo to Strasbourg on loan for the upcoming 2023/24 season, according to the French side's chief scout. The 18-year-old winger signed from Santos for  Â£13m earlier this summer having made 129 appearances in all competitions for the Brazilian side, scoring five goals. Angelo was taken on Chelsea's summer tour to the United States and has featured in wins over Brighton and Wrexham in July so far. It was decided upon his signing that the Brazilian would train with the Blues this summer, as revealed by 90min, and he will soon have the opportunity to showcase his talents in Ligue 1 if he joins Patrick Vieira's side as their scout suggests. On Angelo's future, chief scout Loic Desire said: "He won't be arriving straight away, as Chelsea want to integrate him into the club first. He'll come in August after the tour of the United States. We want to bring more variety to Patrick Vieira."  Strasbourg was recently bought by BlueCo, Chelsea's American owners. The French club's president Marc Keller previously claimed receiving Chelsea players on loan wasn't part of their original strategy, stating: "It isn't the project. "We have had meetings with the sports department to define the objectives. We will have more means to be more ambitious. Loic Desire will have the handle on discussions about players that could interest us if there are any. They also have to want to come to us." Angelo was the youngest debutant in the history of the Brazilian top flight at 15 years and 308 days and has made appearances for the country's Under-15, Under-17 and Under-20 teams. The Blues are expected to part with a number of youth players on loan deals, having already shipped out a legion of unwanted first-team squad members.
