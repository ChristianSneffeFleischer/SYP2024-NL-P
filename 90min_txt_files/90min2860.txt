West Ham United have confirmed the signing of Burnley winger Maxwel Cornet on a five-year deal. The 25-year-old, who can play on both wings as well at wing-back or full-back, arrives at London Stadium after West Ham triggered the  Â£17.5m release clause in his Burnley contract - one that became active after the Clarets' relegation to the Championship. Cornet's contract contains an option to extend by a further year, and the Ivorian, who will wear the number 14 shirt, has expressed his delight at signing for the Hammers.    It   s a new step for me to join this big Club and I   m really happy to be here, to be part of the project for the club. I   m just excited to start,    Cornet said.    Everyone knows the level here in the Premier League is very high and I want to play here for that, so I'm really happy to be here for the next stage in my career.    It will be amazing to play in front of 62,500 fans at London Stadium. I played here for Burnley last season and I can   t wait to experience it as a West Ham player.
