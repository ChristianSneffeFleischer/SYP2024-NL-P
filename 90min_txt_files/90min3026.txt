Chelsea have raised their offer to meet Sevilla's asking price for defender Jules Kounde, 90min understands. The France international is a long-term target for Chelsea and they have turned back to him having missed out on priority centre-back signing Matthijs de Ligt, who has joined Bayern Munich from Juventus. As reported by 90min, the Blues returned to the negotiating table for Kounde earlier this week and lodged an offer worth    55m - but that was still    10m short of the La Liga side's valuation. However, Chelsea remained in talks and 90min has now learned that their latest bid of    65m ( Â£55m) - which includes add-ons worth around    10m - has been accepted in principle by Sevilla's sporting director Monchi. Monchi has now given Kounde the green light to finalise the move, although personal terms were agreed earlier this month - giving Chelsea confidence that a deal can be confirmed within days.  It is believed that Barcelona remain in contact with Sevilla, but they are yet to even make a firm offer and Chelsea are confident of finally sealing a transfer for a player they have been trying to sign for over 12 months. The Catalan media believe that Kounde has a preference to move to Camp Nou, but 90min has been told that is not the case and the player is more than happy to head to west London.
