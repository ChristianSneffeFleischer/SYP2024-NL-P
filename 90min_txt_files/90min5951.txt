Former Barcelona captain Carles Puyol has tweeted his support for Lionel Messi after news broke regarding the forward's desire to leave the Catalan giants.  Puyol's tweet was posted shortly after Messi's imminent Camp Nou exit was first reported, and seemingly adds credence to these reports.  Respeto y admiraci  n, Leo. Todo mi apoyo, amigo. According to Argentine media outlet TyC Sports  Messi has told Barcelona of his desire to leave the club via fax, insisting that he will activate a clause to end unilaterally his contract this summer. If this is actually possible remains to be seen, as the club remain adamant that the clause Messi is referring to expired in May, while the player himself believes that it is still valid due to the season being elongated following the COVID-19 enforced lockdown.  Yes, it's all very complicated, and is sure to rumble on for the next few weeks.  No matter what the outcome is, Messi has the full backing of his former captain Puyol, who stated his admiration of the club's all-time record goalscorer forcing the club's hand regarding his own future.  "Respect and admiration Leo. All my support man."
