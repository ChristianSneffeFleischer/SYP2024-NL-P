Espanyol chief executive Mao Ye has said that while he intends to keep in-demand striker Raul de Tomas, he couldn't guarantee that he will stay. The Spain international was only outscored by Karim Benzema and Iago Aspas in La Liga last season and has since been linked with moves to Premier League clubs such as Arsenal, Aston Villa, Leeds United and Nottingham Forest. Real Madrid have also been touted with an interest in their academy graduate, while Bayern Munich too are said to be keeping tabs on him. De Tomas returned later to pre-season training amid speculation of a move away and following Spain's Nations League fixtures in June, and Ye has admitted that he could leave, though is hopeful this will not be the case, "There is no Raul de Tomas situation. He arrived later in the pre-season and will need more training time to reach the required level," he said. "He has given us a lot of quality and he is a key part of the squad. This week, La Liga begins and we hope that    RDT    will continue to contribute for us.
