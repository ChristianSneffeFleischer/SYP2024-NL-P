This summer has seen another influx of star players arriving in Major League Soccer, from Italian duo Lorenzo Insigne and Federico Bernardeschi in Toronto to Gareth Bale and Giorgio Chiellini in Los Angeles.  Of course, MLS is fast becoming a league where young talent is developed and moved to Europe, but there's still a place for veterans coming the other way. The experience and quality they bring can often be the difference between silverware and heartbreak. So, what about Eden Hazard? The Belgium international has been linked with a move to MLS in the past, thanks in part to his failure to hit the heights so far at Real Madrid.

In an interview with ESPN, Hazard, now 31, didn't rule out a MLS transfer in the future, but insisted it's not something he's thinking about right now. The focus remains on proving his quality in La Liga. "I don't think about that much now, I'm just focused," Hazard responded when asked about the possibility of playing MLS. He added: "It's been three years [which have been] hard for me, so I'm just focused on this season. I still have a contract after two more years, and then we'll see. In two years I'm going to be 33, so let's see what can happen." Hazard is about to enter his fourth season with Real Madrid. But despite a glittering previous spell with Chelsea, the 120-time Belgium international is yet to play more than 18 league games in a single season for Los Blancos. Injuries have stopped the winger from showing what he's truly capable of, with Hazard registering just six goals and 10 assists in 66 appearances across all competitions.
