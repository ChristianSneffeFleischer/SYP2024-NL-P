Bologna director Marco di Vaio has insisted the club count on Marko Arnautovic and plan to keep him despite interest from Manchester United. United want more attacking reinforcements due to the uncertainty around Cristiano Ronaldo's future and an injury suffered by Anthony Martial, both of which left Christian Eriksen playing up front in their opening Premier League fixture with Brighton that they lost 2-1. Arnautovic has emerged as a target, having previously worked with Red Devils boss Erik ten Hag at Twente, and his brother and agent has revealed he is trying to get Bologna to let the Austria forward leave. However, Di Vaio has claimed the Serie A club want to keep Arnautovic, who scored 14 league goals last season. He said:    Manchester United on Arnautovic? We   re proud of the interest for Marko but we are not planning to sell him.    We want to keep him at Bologna as the president said, he   s a key part of our project - there   s not even a price tag."
