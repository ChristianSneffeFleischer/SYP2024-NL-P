Sadio Mane is set to join Bayern Munich from Liverpool in one of the biggest moves of the summer transfer window. The Senegalese superstar is bringing an end his six-year association with the Reds and his eight-year stay in England to sign for the German champions. Bayern have established themselves as one of the most potent attacking teams in Europe in the last decade, boasting a wide array of forward options. There are plenty of ways Mane could fit in at the Allianz Arena, so 90min decided to explore what they are... Mane played more of a central role in Liverpool's front three in 2022. His strength and proficiency in the air made him the perfect fit to lead the Reds' line, particularly after the signing of fellow left-winger Luis Diaz. With Robert Lewandowski continuing to push for a move to Barcelona this summer, it's likely that we'll see Mane deployed through the middle in Munich. Fortunately for the 30-year-old, Bayern have plenty of wide forwards to help him out from the flanks. Leroy Sane, Kingsley Coman, Serge Gnabry and Jamal Musiala's are among Europe's elite, while Alphonso Davies could also star as an orthodox winger if they were really stretched. However, Gnabry's future remains up in the air and he too could leave the Bavarian side this window. Possible lineups: For most of his career though, Mane has been a wide forward capable of both stretching play and coming inside. Mane started on the right when he first arrived at Liverpool but made his name on the left, and it's likely he would start there for Bayern if Julian Nagelsmann sees him as a wide player. If Gnabry stays then he will be the first choice right-winger, while Sane often started there in the final few months of the 2021/22 campaign.
