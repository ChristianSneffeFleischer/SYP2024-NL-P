Newcastle have been linked with a surprise move for towering Aberdeen striker Sam Cosgrove as Steve Bruce looks to strengthen his striking options. Cosgrove has been one of the Scottish Premiership's most consistent strikers over the past two seasons, with 44 goals in all competitions spanning across the 2018/19 and 2019/20 campaigns. The 6'4 target man terrorised SPFL defences and even managed six goals in six appearances in Europa League qualifying last term.  Aberdeen's financial situation saw them accept a  Â£2m bid from Guingamp in July but the Englishman opted to stay put under Derek McInnes. He's since suffered from a disrupted start to this season - a serious knee injury and a controversial breach of Covid regulations kept him out of the team until November. ? Happy birthday to Sam Cosgrove who turns 24 today.? Have a great day @samcozzee.#StandFree pic.twitter.com/ub3uusNdX3 He has been gingerly reintroduced by McInnes but has managed to score just once in his six appearances, looking more like the naff striker who couldn't hit a barn door in his debut season than the talisman that has ragdolled defenders in recent years.  Newcastle, however, seem willing to look past his recent dip, with the Scottish Sun reporting that scouts from Tyneside are assessing his viability. They say the Magpies have 'targeted' Cosgrove, but don't really elaborate, only adding that they have 'made checks' on the 24-year-old.  The Yorkshire-born striker came through the ranks at Everton before joining Wigan's academy at Under-18 level. He dotted around with a couple of non-league loan spells before joining Carlisle permanently in 2017, where he would fail to make the grade over 18 months.
