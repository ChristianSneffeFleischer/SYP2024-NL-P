Lyon's Houssem Aouar is now Arsenal's top transfer target this window, with Mikel Arteta desperate to add a creative midfielder to his side. The young Frenchman is expected to leave Les Gones this window, and the Gunners hold a keen interest in the midfielder. ??    Come like Thierry Henry...   This week we linked up with @Official_Yizzy to chat about his new banger Thierry Henry, what it was like working with @Arsenal, grime   s connection with football and the South London MCs relationship with @AFTVMedia https://t.co/yc7I5u6FyF pic.twitter.com/crydIP6lPf  And according to ESPN, Arsenal are the frontrunners for Aouar's signature. The Gunners are the only side who have shown a strong interest in the young Frenchman, as other linked clubs - including Manchester City and Juventus - are looking to strengthen in different areas. Arteta eventually plans to employ a 4-3-3 formation at Arsenal and believes he can build a team around the talented 22-year-old. The problem for Arteta is that Aouar won't come cheap as Lyon want    60 million for him - a fee that Arsenal cannot afford without selling other players first.  Arteta is desperate to bring in more creative players, but also wants to get rid of those who are not committed to the process. Achieving this is proving to be extremely difficult, particularly as the club have already struggled to sell Mesut   zil and Matteo Guendouzi.  Guendouzi was offered to Lyon as part of a potential exchange deal for Aouar, but the French club dismissed the offer as he is not someone they are interested in. Meanwhile,   zil looks set to see out his massive  Â£350,000-a-week contract, causing huge problems for Arsenal as they aim to rebalance their wage structure.
