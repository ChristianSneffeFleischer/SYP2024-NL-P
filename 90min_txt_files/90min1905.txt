Wolves are close to finalising a deal to bring former Southampton star Mario Lemina back to the Premier League, sources have confirmed to 90min. The 29-year-old, also once of Marseille and Juventus, permanently left the Saints to join Nice in the summer of 2021. But just 18 months later he is on his way back to England. 90min understands that Wolves have agreed to pay Nice around  Â£9.5m for the Gabon international. Lemina is now due in England for his medical at Molineux and could be signed before the weekend. Wolves have already added Matheus Cunha from Atletico Madrid this month, but they are not finished  in the market and want defenders too. Talks have been held with Cunha's former team-mate Felipe and also West Ham's Craig Dawson, a player they had tried to sign during the summer. New Wolves boss Julen Lopetegui is looking to bolster his squad ahead of a crucial second half of the season and insists the club are working hard on doing just that.    The best signing is their support and after, of course, we will try to improve the squad because we need signings," said the Spaniard.    But, at the moment, until the signings arrive we have to put the focus on the players here now in the squad. We have to support them in the same way, always. We are working and focusing on our daily work and looking for the next match.    In the same way, the club is working to try to balance the team a bit more. We have some positions that we have to improve and have more players in, because we will have four very hard matches in the next 10 days. We have to share this (workload), otherwise it   s not a good thing for the players or the club. They know this and they are working to have more players.
