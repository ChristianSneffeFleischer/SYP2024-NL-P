Tottenham have confirmed Joe Rodon has joined French side Rennes on a season-long loan with the option to make the move permanent. Rodon joined Spurs on the final day of the extended 2020 summer transfer window, but has scarcely featured during his time in north London, making just 24 appearances. The 24-year-old has rarely looked out of place in a Spurs shirt and Antonio Conte has admitted he maybe should have called on him more last season, but with Wales' World Cup campaign on the horizon, Rodon wanted to leave in search of consistent game time. And a loan move to Rennes was announced on Monday, with the Ligue 1 outfit retaining a    20m buy option.
