Son Heung-min has confirmed he would rather remain in the Premier League than accept the riches on offer in Saudi Arabia. The Tottenham winger is one of many targets for Saudi Arabian officials, with offers both for this summer and in 2024 reported to be on the cards. However, Son has put an end to any uncertainty, making it abundantly clear that the level of competition in the Premier League is more valuable than any money on offer in the Saudi Pro League. "Right now, money is not important to me," Son confirmed. "The most important thing is to play in a league that I enjoy playing in.  "I have so much more I want to accomplish in the Premier League. I absolutely love playing in the Premier League, so I want to prepare for the next season the best I can." Son also quoted a past statement from former South Korean captain Ki Sung-yeung, who previously vowed never to play in another Asian league because of his love for his country. feed Son, whose current Tottenham contract runs until 2025, has used the international break to get an insight into life under new manager Ange Postecoglou, who managed South Korean teammate Oh Hyeon-gyu at Celtic. "[Son] asked me about Ange's style - what he emphasises, his style of play," Oh revealed earlier this week. "I   ve only played for Ange for half a year, but I already know that he   s tactically exceptional. I believe he   ll succeed," Spurs will soon have to address Son's contract situation but their immediate priority is working with striker Harry Kane, whose deal has just 12 months left to run. 90min understands that Spurs are prepared to rebuff all interest in their talisman as they remain confident they can convince Kane to sign a new contract next season.
