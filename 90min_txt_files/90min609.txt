Barcelona president Joan Laporta has confirmed the club is looking to complete a deal for young Fenerbahce prospect Arda Guler. Dubbed the 'Turkish Messi', 18-year-old Guler grabbed four goals and three assists in 20 Super Lig appearances in 2022/23 as Fenerbahce finished second. He is said to have a    17.5m release clause and has been tracked by Bar  a's Clasico rivals Real Madrid as well as Arsenal and Newcastle. New sporting director Deco recently flew to Turkey for talks with Fenerbahce and Laporta has now revealed the deal should be given the sign-off from La Liga. He said to Esport3: "Deco was in Istanbul, he says that [Guler] is a great talent. feed "Now, La Liga allow us to carry out the operations that do not count for this year. Our scouting department was following him. We are trying to complete the deal." Guler broke into Fenerbahce's first team set-up last season with three goals and three assists in the league and made his senior bow for Turkey in November 2022. He also netted his first international goal in a 2-0 Euro 2024 qualifier victory over Wales. Bar  a's prospects in the transfer market have been affected by off-field scandals and financial mismanagement in recent years. Laporta recently hit out at a 'campaign against Bar  a' over the Negreira case which lead to a ban from the Champions League. The arrival of Ilkay Gundogan has been confirmed after the midfielder's starring role in Manchester City's treble-winning campaign of 2022/23 while stalwarts Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba have departed.
