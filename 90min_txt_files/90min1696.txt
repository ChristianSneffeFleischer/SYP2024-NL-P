Arsenal are considering a late bit to test Leicester City's resolve to keep hold of Youri Tielemans, sources have told 90min. The Belgium international has turned down all offers of a new deal at the King Power Stadium and is set to leave when his contract expires at the end of the season. Arsenal are long-term admirers of Tielemans and they are very much in play to sign him on a free transfer in the summer, but they are considering making an offer as their efforts to land Brighton's Moises Caicedo look set to come to nothing. The Gunners have submitted two bids for Caicedo, the latest of which was worth  £65m plus  £5m in add-ons, but Brighton barely even considered either offer before turning Arsenal away and insisting the Ecuador international is not for sale. Listen now as  Scott Saunders  hosts  Graeme Bailey  and  Toby Cudworth  to discuss the latest transfer news. On today's agenda: Dusan Vlahovic, Anthony Gordon, Enzo Fernandes, Amadou Onana, Malo Gusto, Nicolo Zaniolo, Pedro Porro, Weston McKennie, Milan Skriniar, Maiximo Perrone & more!
