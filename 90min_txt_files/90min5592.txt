Tottenham Hotspur are rumoured to be weighing up a move for Leicester City's Demarai Gray. 24-year-old Gray has been with the Foxes for four years, signing just after their title win in 2016. He has accumulated 167 appearances during this time and scored 13 goals. However, Gray's current deal expires at the end of the season, and the Englishman looks set to depart the King Power Stadium after resisting attempts to tie him down to a longer deal. Tottenham are reported to have been following Gray closely for the past three seasons and even made a bid for the attacker before he signed an improved Leicester deal back in 2017. Football Insider claim that Jose Mourinho's interest in the player matches that of his predecessor Mauricio Pochettino. It is said that the Portuguese manager has already spoken to Gray in an attempt to engineer a deal before the 5th October transfer deadline.
