Barcelona could still sign Lautaro Martinez after the culmination of this season's Champions League, according to club president Josep Maria Bartomeu.  Martinez enjoyed a fruitful season for Inter, registering 19 goal involvements in 35 Serie A games and forming a prolific partnership with Romelu Lukaku.  Barca had earmarked the 22-year-old as the player capable of freshening up their ageing forward line. However, their lengthy pursuit of the Argentine was brought to an end publicly in July when Bartomeu revealed that the coronavirus pandemic had led to the club reassessing their transfer strategy. Now, the Blaugrana president has completed a dramatic U-turn, revealing that Barca would attempt to reignite the deal at the end of the season.  "The move is completely on hold. When the Champions League is over, we'll speak with Inter. Right now we're more focused on the games coming up," Bartomeu said (via Sport).

The young pair are attracting interest from Leicester and Bayern Munich respectively but Bartomeu insisted they would not be leaving.  "Neither  Pedri nor Trincao are for sale. Araujo, Riqui Puig and Ansu Fati aren't either because we are creating a new generation," he said. The 57-year-old was speaking before Bar  a's crunch tie against Napoli on Saturday. The two sides are facing off for a place in the Champions League quarter finals with the scores level at 1-1.
