Real Madrid striker Luka Jovic is said to be desperate for regular first-team action next season and the Spanish giants are exploring the possibility of sending him out on loan. The Serbia international joined Los Blancos in a    60m deal last summer off the back of a majestic campaign in Germany with Eintracht Frankfurt. He scored 27 times in all competitions, including an impressive ten strikes in the Europa League as Die Adler were beaten in the semi-finals by Chelsea. Jovic is expected to be the heir to Karim Benzema's throne at the Bernabeu, but the Frenchman's stellar campaign amid Real's La Liga title triumph meant opportunities were hard to come by for the 22-year-old in his debut season.  The former Frankfurt gunman earned just 420 minutes of top flight action, scoring twice.  Thus, with Benzema expected to lead the Real line once more in 2020/21, chances for Jovic are once again set to be minimal.  Marca understands the Serb is desperate for minutes and a solution could be to send him out on loan. Zinedine Zidane is also keen on the idea of Jovic accumulating minutes - at Real or elsewhere - next season, and the striker is said to be searching for potential destinations. Italian giants Milan - who were linked with a move at the start of the summer - have approached Real regarding Jovic in recent weeks, as have Hertha BSC among other Bundesliga clubs.
