Sadio Mane has revealed that he would like Bayern Munich to sign Joao Cancelo on a permanent transfer from Manchester City. After joining City from Juventus in 2019, Cancelo established himself as one of Europe's finest full-backs, demonstrating a proficiency to play on either flank and on the wing. But he fell out of favour under Pep Guardiola at the start of the 2022/23 season and was surprisingly sent out on loan to Bayern at the back-end of the January transfer window. Cancelo has since struggled for consistent minutes in Germany, but made an impression in a 5-3 win at home to Bavarian neighbours Augsburg on Saturday, grabbing their first goal and a late assist for Alphonso Davies.

So good, really, we are very happy that he is playing for us," he said. "I would like to see him with us next season. We need exactly the kind of players, for sure!" Bayern have already stated they would like to sign Cancelo but are unwilling to pay the    70m purchase clause in their loan agreement with Man City. LISTEN NOW
