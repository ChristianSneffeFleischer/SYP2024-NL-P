Nottingham Forest have made a late approach to sign Jesse Lingard and are in advanced talks with his representatives, 90min can confirm. The 29-year-old has been without a club after being released by Manchester United at the end of June and has been strongly linked with a return to West Ham - whom he enjoyed a terrific loan spell with during the second half of the 2020/21 season. Lingard has been considering his options for a number of months, amid interest from Everton, clubs in MLS and even a team in Saudi Arabia, and is thought to want close to  Â£200,000-per-week in wages. It is believed that West Ham are his preferred destination, but the Hammers have been reluctant to meet his demands - despite manager David Moyes' strong desire to bring him back to London Stadium. However, 90min understands that Nottingham Forest, back in the Premier League after a 23-year absence, are now attempting to strike a deal with Lingard and are confident of bringing him to the City Ground. The Premier League new boys have invested heavily in their squad this summer, breaking their transfer record for Union Berlin striker Taiwo Awoniyi and bringing in Dean Henderson on loan among others, and any offer put forward to Lingard will almost certainly make him the highest-paid player at the club.
