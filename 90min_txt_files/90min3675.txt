Right-back Alistair Johnston has highlighted CF Montreal's willingness to 'move mountains' as key to his transfer from Nashville SC. Johnston was among the best right-backs in MLS last season across his 28 appearances and was rewarded with his first 18 senior caps for the Canadian national team. Following a couple of weeks of speculation, Johnston completed a move back to his homeland, with Montreal paying $1m of General Allocation Money (GAM) for his services. Nashville also retain a 10% sell-on clause starting at $1m if the defender is transferred again in the future. Johnston has been given a healthy pay rise following his move to Montreal, but he insists it was the feeling of being wanted that made the move so attractive.    The money   s as much about that as it is anything else,    Johnston said during a video conference (via the Calgary Herald).    You want to be somewhere where you feel like you   re wanted. And I always felt wanted in Nashville. It just felt like Montreal was willing to move mountains     and move anything possible     to come get me. And that was something that really stuck out for me and got me excited about this potential move.    Still just 23, a lot has changed for Johnston over the last 12 months, going from a relative rookie to the starting right-back for one of the strongest Canadian teams in recent memory. ? @_a_johnston #CFMTL pic.twitter.com/LowonbilI7 But as performance levels increase, so does pressure. For Johnston, that's no bad thing.    When I was in Nashville, if I made a mistake, people would say    he   s still a rookie, he   s still one of the young guys just out of college,        he said.    Now I   m a Canadian international. They paid a big transfer fee to get me, so the pressure is going to come. But, as a football player, you want that pressure."
