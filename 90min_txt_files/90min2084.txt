Paris Saint-Germain are determined to keep Lionel Messi and are convinced he will sign a new contract with them, sources have confirmed to 90min. The 35-year-old, now a World Cup winner following Argentina's victory over France in the 2022 final last weekend, is out of contract at the end of the season and PSG want him to finalise a new deal. 90min understands that PSG are willing to offer Messi a new long-term contract. But, as it stands, it is believed the seven-time Ballon d'Or winner is not looking to commit beyond the next 18 months. Major League Soccer's Inter Miami have already made moves to convince Messi to join them in Florida, but 90min is told by sources that he is likely to stay in Europe for two more seasons. Barcelona have made it known to Messi that they would like him back. 90min understands that his family and advisors have encouraged him to consider the option - but the main issue is Messi's relationship with president Joan Laporta, which turned sour when he left Camp Nou in 2021. Laporta himself has since openly tried to lure Messi back and reiterated that point this week after the player lifted the World Cup trophy.    Messi is the best player of all time. He   s Bar  a fan, his heart beats for Bar  a so the links are normal   , Laporta told Bar  aTV.    Will Messi return? He   s PSG player. We   d love to have Leo back here one day but we will see."
