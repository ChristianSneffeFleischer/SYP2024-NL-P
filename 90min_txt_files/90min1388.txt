Adrien Rabiot has admitted that he could yet sign a new contract with Juventus before his current deal expires in the summer.  The midfielder's current deal is due to expire in the coming months, and 90min understands that Tottenham, Liverpool and Manchester United have all asked to be kept informed of how talks between the player's representatives are going.  Following a torrid 2021/22 campaign in which Rabiot didn't score a single goal in 45 appearances for Juve, the French international has performed much better in 2022/23 by scoring nine in his 33 appearances to date.  Due to this upturn in form, Juve are keen to get the player to sign new terms at the club - something which, in conversation with Tuttosport, Rabiot admitted is aactually a possibility. "At the moment there are no updates, but surely we'll speak soon because the season will finish in two months," the 28-year-old said. "I am calm. There's a chance I leave, but I could also sign a new contract with Juventus. I am happy in Turin, I am doing a good job and on good terms with the directors, the teammates and the coach. He [Allegri] has helped me over the last two years, trusting me a lot. This is important to feel well and make the right decision for my future."
