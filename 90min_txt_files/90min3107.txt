Sevilla are in talks to re-sign left-back Sergio Reguilon, having previously had the player on loan during the 2019/20 campaign. Reguilon played 38 times for Sevilla during his season there and helped the club win the Europa League. Parent club Real Madrid then cashed in and he made the permanent switch to Spurs for around    30m     Manchester United were also interested. But the Spaniard   s future at Spurs has been increasingly uncertain. He was dropped midway through last season shortly after Antonio Conte was appointed manager, coinciding with the re-emergence of Ryan Sessegnon, while an injury also cut his campaign short. Fast forward to this summer and Reguilon was among a handful of players left out of the travelling squad for the pre-season tour of South Korea, with Ivan Perisic having arrived from Inter to add further competition for places. 90min understands that Sevilla are interested in having him return to Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan and talks are already underway. The 25-year-old, whose contract with Tottenham runs to 2025, has other offers from around Europe but would prefer to sign with Sevilla.
