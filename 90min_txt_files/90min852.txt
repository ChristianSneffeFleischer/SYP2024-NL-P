Aston Villa have opened talks over a deal for Athletic Club winger Nico Williams, sources have told 90min. Villa are in the market for at least one wide player, if not two, and had been looking at Barcelona duo Ferran Torres and Ansu Fati. Williams is also a player very highly-rated within the club and they are progressing in talks with Athletic. 20-year-old Williams has just 12 months left on his current deal at San Mames, and Athletic know that they would struggle to match any offer that arrives from the Premier League. Villa, though, are not the only English club showing an interest in Williams. 90min understands that Arsenal have appreciated him for a long time, and are keeping close tabs on the situation. It is also understood both Manchester City and Newcastle have enquired in recent months. feed Williams, who has come through the youth ranks in Bilbao, is considered one of the top young attacking prospects in Europe, and Athletic insist that they want to keep him beyond the summer transfer window. Director of football Mikel Gonzalez commented that both Nico and his brother Inaki are a key part of the club. "Nico, Inaki and his entire family very happy at Athletic...I see him happy in Bilbao," Gonzalez told Eldes Marque over the weekend when asked about Williams' future.
