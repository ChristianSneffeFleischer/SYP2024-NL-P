Real Madrid   s interest in Arsenal   s Kieran Tierney has solidified following a month-long review of the Scottish defender's performances, 90min understands. The Spanish giants have been keeping close tabs on Arsenal, with scouts initially checking in on the progress of England international winger Bukayo Saka. Saka did impress, but another player to catch the eye was 24-year-old left-back Tierney, who was watched in action throughout January and February.  Real are looking for defensive reinforcements, and they believe Tierney - who can also play centrally as well as at left-back - could be just the sort of versatile player they need for their squad going forward. Sources have told 90min that Real's highly acclaimed chief scout Juni Calafat has watched Tierney himself and liked what he saw, and now Real are very much considering a move for the defender. Elsewhere, Brendan Rodgers remains a huge fan of Tierney after they worked together at Celtic. The Leicester manager tried unsuccessfully to sign him in 2020 after his initial move from Glasgow to London was faltering.
