Mason Mount's representatives have agreed personal terms in principle with Manchester United ahead of a potential summer move, sources have confirmed to 90min. The 24-year-old is out of contract in 2024 and Chelsea have told the midfielder he will be sold if no extension is agreed. Talks over a new deal have stalled in recent months, though Chelsea always held out hope of persuading their homegrown star to remain. However, Mount's father Tony has become increasingly agitated with Chelsea's stance and handling of the situation, which has seen them explore options elsewhere. Liverpool, Arsenal and Newcastle have all spoken to Mount but Man Utd have jumped to the head of the queue to sign him. Sources have confirmed to 90min Mount's people are 'pleased' with the terms on offer and United's plans for him should he complete a move to Old Trafford. One issue could yet be the fee of any deal, something which has not yet been discussed between the two clubs. United are understood to value Mount at around  £50m but Chelsea feel he is worth more in the region of  £75m. feed Should Mount leave it would represent a major overhaul in the Blues' midfield as they are also selling Mateo Kovacic, who like Mount has a year left on his deal and has refused a new contract. They are also yet to finalise terms with N'Golo Kante, who could leave for nothing in the coming weeks. A new midfielder is one of the primary targets for United and Erik Ten Hag this summer, along with a new number nine and a defender. Chelsea insist they have not given up hope. Mount was due to meet the club with new manager Mauricio Pochettino this week, although it's believed the England international's issues with the club are so entrenched it will be difficult to persuade him to stay.
