Chelsea have launched a late transfer window bid for Ajax midfielder Edson Alvarez, and the Mexican has made it known that he wants to move, 90min understands. Alvarez has been the subject of interest from a number of clubs this summer, including Newcastle who spoke to Ajax earlier this month. But their approach at around    40m was rejected. The 24-year-old Mexico international accepted Ajax shunning Newcastle's approach, but the bid from Chelsea is a different matter after the Blues put a    50m ( Â£43m) offer on the table. Sources with knowledge of the situation have told 90min that Alvarez believes this opportunity is too good to turn down. He has just seen Antony finalise a move to Manchester United after demanding a move to the Premier League, and now he is ready try and pull of the same method to join Chelsea. However, with just over 24 hours of the transfer window remaining, a deal would have to move quickly. Alvarez is making it clear to Ajax he wants them to accept the offer. One issue for Ajax is that a KNVB administrative mistake earlier in the summer means that the transfer window for Dutch clubs closes 24 hour earlier than the rest of Europe, so they would likely not have any time to find a replacement if they did sanction Alvarez's exit.
