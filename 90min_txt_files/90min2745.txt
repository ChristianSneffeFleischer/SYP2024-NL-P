The transfer window in Dutch football will close 24 hours earlier than most of Europe's top leagues because of an error from the country's Football Association (KNVB). When confirming their plans to FIFA ahead of the summer, the KNVB decided to close their transfer window on August 31, seemingly not realising that the majority of Europe had opted for September 1 instead. The KNVB did not even realise their mistake until it was pointed out by Dutch news outlet Voetbal International, prompting the association to come out and admit they had made an error and were in talks with FIFA over a solution. However, FIFA have rejected the KNVB's request for an emergency window extension, meaning Eredivisie sides will have to have their business finished by the evening of August 31.    As previously communicated, there was little chance that the request would be honoured, because the FIFA regulations prescribe that no more changes can be made when the transfer window is open," a KNVB statement confirmed. "Other associations have made a similar request to the KNVB and they have all received a rejection.    The error leaves Eredivisie sides vulnerable to losing their players without being able to replace them on September 1, when the transfer windows in Europe's top leagues will still be open.
