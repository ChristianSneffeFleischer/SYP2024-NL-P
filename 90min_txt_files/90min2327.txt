Edson Alvarez has admitted he is 'disappointed' a summer move to Chelsea failed to materialise. The 25-year-old defensive midfielder was the subject of a late bid from Stamford Bridge as new Blues co-owner Todd Boehly looked to rebuild the side with a lavish spending spree. Alvarez even went as far as refusing to train with Ajax as he sought to force the transfer through, but Chelsea were unable to reach an agreement with the Dutch side and the Mexican was forced to remain in the Eredivisie for another season. "I am very disappointed about it," Alvarez told ESPN. "But I am convinced that one day another big club will come for me. This winter, or in the summer. For now I can only focus on Ajax." It was a tricky summer for Ajax, who saw stars Antony and Lisandro Martinez both follow former boss Erik ten Hag to Manchester United Other players such as Alvarez and defender Jurrien Timber were also linked with moves away, but Ajax held firm and were able to prevent their entire team from moving onto pastures new. Despite this turbulence, Ajax sit atop the Eredivisie after 11 games. However, their Champions League campaign is in tatters after Alfred Schreuder's side picked up just three points from their opening five group games.
