Manchester City see Sevilla defender Diego Carlos as one of their leading transfer targets this summer, with the Brazilian viewed as a more financially viable alternative to Kalidou Koulibaly. City have yet to meaningfully replace the presence of Vincent Kompany since the Belgian departed for Anderlecht. 19-year-old Eric Garcia has emerged as the first-choice partner to Aymeric Laporte, but Pep Guardiola is believed to be keen to shuffle his defensive options once the season is over, with the futures of John Stones and Nicolas Otamendi up in the air.  Koulibaly has been the obvious target, but even with his reduced asking price, he would set City back around  Â£75m. For a 29-year-old, off the back of a disappointing domestic season, City and a host of other clubs may see that as a little steep.  The best centre-backs in world football. Done. pic.twitter.com/QNnn3QfUTX The Telegraph say that is the case, anyway, as they claim that City's search for alternatives has led them to Seville, where they now see Carlos as one of their primary targets.
