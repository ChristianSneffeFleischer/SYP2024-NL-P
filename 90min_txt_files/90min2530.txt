PSV Eindhoven forward Cody Gakpo has confessed he spent the majority of the transfer window believing he would join Manchester United. The Dutch international was one of many forward targets for United boss Erik ten Hag but the Red Devils ultimately decided to sign just one, Antony from Ajax for    100m. Gakpo received plenty of interest late in the transfer window but ultimately opted to remain with PSV, and he has now opened up to club media about what happened this summer. "It was hectic. Days, weeks, months...I'm glad it's over," he confessed. "It was difficult [to deal with] because it was my first time to decide between staying or going. You hope for immediate clarity at the start of the window so you can focus on PSV or your new club but that didn't come. "At the start of the window, United registered their interest but not very strongly, so I was waiting for a bit, and then the end was approaching and the signals became more positive. I started thinking it could fall that way eventually. "The interest faded last week, so the whole window I worked towards that and then it faded. So then I was watching last week, thinking 'what is the right thing to do?'. "I feel at home here, in my own city. Everyone knows how I feel, but you have to look at all your options, but in the end I know I made the right choice." Once United's interest faded, Gakpo received significant offers from both Southampton and Leeds United, but he admitted he did not believe as though either move was right for him. "I spoke to other clubs, Premier League clubs which could be a good step, but there are more factors to consider, like the World Cup," he said.
