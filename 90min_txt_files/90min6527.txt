Brazilian legend Ronaldo has jokingly offered Alexis Sanchez a chance to rediscover his form... at Real Valladolid. Since leaving Arsenal for Manchester United in January 2018, Sanchez has had a notoriously difficult time as a footballer, scoring just five times in 45 appearances for the Red Devils, before being loaned out to Serie A challengers Inter. The 31-year-old has struggled with injury in Milan, however, and has scored just once in 17 games. He looks set to return to Old Trafford at the end of the season, though whether he will get another chance to impress under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer remains to be seen.  Still, if worst comes to worst, the two-time Copa America winner always has an offer in La Liga to fall back on.  Speaking in a Zoom press conference, former Real Madrid striker Ronaldo - who is now the majority owner at 15th-placed Real Valladolid - joked that Sanchez could join his side if things don't work out elsewhere. He is quoted by the Mirror as saying: "Alexis Sanchez has succeeded wherever he's gone. He has a lot of quality. "If he doesn't succeed at Inter, Valladolid will open their doors to him." While it's an eyebrow-raising prospect, Valladolid are just a little unlikely to be able to afford the wages of a player like Sanchez, whose United contract signed in 2018 put him on around  Â£400k a week. Valladolid do, however, have another former Premier League favourite on their books in Hatem Ben Arfa, while star defender Mohammed Salisu has been linked with a big move this summer.
