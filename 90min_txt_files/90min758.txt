Bayern Munich are close to completing the signing of South Korean centre-back Kim Min-jae from Napoli, 90min understands. Kim, one of the stand-out defenders in Europe last season, has a    50m release clause in his contract which becomes active in July and has rejected the offer of a new deal in Naples which would remove that clause. Manchester United have long been trying to win the race for Kim's signature but progress in negotiations with the 26-year-old's entourage has been slow, allowing Bayern to join the race. Bayern quickly voiced a willingness to trigger Kim's release clause and set about negotiating a contract with the South Korean, and sources have confirmed to 90min that the German side are close to getting a deal done. Indeed, Napoli believe Kim is set to join Bayern and are now waiting for his release clause to be triggered early next month. feed United remain in talks with Kim's entourage but have not made any real progress over the past week, with the belief now that the centre-back is heading to Germany. Bayern have targeted Kim as they brace for interest in French international Lucas Hernandez, who has agreed personal terms with Paris Saint-Germain. President Herbert Hainer recently confirmed Bayern's desire to keep Lucas but, given he is approaching the final year of his contract, refused to rule out a sale. With Kim now expected to head to Germany, Man Utd will have to look elsewhere and have a number of alternative targets under consideration, including Leeds' Robin Koch and Monaco's Axel Disasi. United are open to parting ways with Harry Maguire but the England international remains determined to stay and fight for his place at Old Trafford.
