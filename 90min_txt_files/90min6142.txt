Danny Rose has revealed his desire to pull on a Tottenham shirt one more time to have a final opportunity to play in front of the club's fans. The full back fell out of favour after Jose Mourinho took the Spurs hot seat, only featuring three times in the Premier League after the former Manchester United manager was appointed in November. Rose moved to Newcastle on loan in January, and admitted in July that his time in north London was likely reaching its conclusion. His Spurs contract expires in 2021, but the defender has now revealed he would happily see out the final year of his deal at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Speaking to the Second Captains podcast, Rose said: "I am very happy to stay at Tottenham and see my last ten or 11 months out, I would love to. There is nothing I want more than to play one more time in front of the fans. "My last game for Spurs was a 1-0 defeat to Liverpool and at the time I didn't know that was going to be or could be my last game for Spurs." Having spent 13 years with Tottenham, the club and fans hold a special place in Rose's heart. The England international cited his love for the supporters as a huge factor in his desire to play for Spurs again. "I want nothing more than to play in front of the Tottenham fans one more time, just to cherish all the moments we have had over the years with them.
