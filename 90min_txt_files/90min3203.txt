Barcelona president Joan Laporta has revealed that the club are 'flattered' that Robert Lewandowski wants to move to the Camp Nou this summer.  The Bayern Munich forward has made his intention of signing for Bar  a clear in recent months, even stating the following in mid-June: "I've asked the club for the go-ahead for a transfer. I think that in the current situation it's the best solution, especially as the club can still receive money from a transfer." Lewandowski's attempts to make a move happen have seemingly been appreciated by Laporta who, in an interview with Marca, thanked the forward for his interest.    Lewandowski is a Bayern player and I prefer to keep reserved on this matter," he said.    I have respect for Bayern and I would not talk about another club   s player. We thank him for wanting to come to Bar  a and we are very flattered.    Although the player is keen on a move, 90min understands that Bayern are standing firm with their     60m valuation with Barcelona's current bid falling way below that figure.  Barcelona's most recent offer for Lewandowski was in the    40m range, but sources close to Bayern believe an agreement closer to    50m could be reached.
