Juventus have turned down an approach from Chelsea for Federico Chiesa.   Big things are expected from Chiesa this season after he enjoyed a promising maiden campaign last time out, following his move from Fiorentina. The forward managed eight goals and eight assists in 30 Serie A games and also featured prominently in the Champions League.  His reputation was further enhanced by his displays for Italy at Euro 2020, where he was one of Gli Azzurri   s best attacking players. In what comes as a big surprise, Chelsea have made an approach for Chiesa. According to Christian Falk, the Blues offered    100m ( Â£85.2m) as the basis for negotiations, but Juventus have declined to enter talks.   It is not hard to see why. With Cristiano Ronaldo set to depart Turin at the end of next season, Juventus are set for a rebuild and they will want Chiesa to be central to that. Max Allegri will be overseeing this new era, following the departure of Andrea Pirlo at the end of last season.   Pirlo struggled during his first season in management, relinquishing the Serie A title and only just guiding Juventus into the the top four on the final day of the campaign. The Old Lady also struggled in Europe, crashing out of the Champions League to FC Porto in the round of 16.
