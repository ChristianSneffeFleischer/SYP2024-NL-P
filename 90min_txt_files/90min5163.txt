Tottenham can sign Milan Skriniar whenever they want, so long as they meet Inter's asking price of  £45m, according to Fabrizio Romano.  The arrival of Joe Rodon from Swansea has plugged the gap for the time being, but Spurs have been on the lookout for another centre-back since the departure of Jan Vertonghen, and are expected to re-enter the market either in January or next summer.  25-year-old Skriniar has been one of their main targets to that end and the club wanted to sign him in September, but the door was closed by Inter president Piero Ausilio towards the closure of the window.     We reiterated that Skriniar is not on the market and no offers have arrived in this sense, rather than reiterating that he will stay here I don   t know what to say,    he said in October.  According to transfer guru Romano, however, Inter's position has always been to sell if their asking price is met. He said on his Here We Go podcast that this hasn't changed, and that Spurs can get their man whenever they like - for  £45m.     Milan Skriniar   s situation hasn   t changed," Romano said.    Inter Milan needs money. If Spurs arrive tomorrow morning with  £45m, Inter will sell him.    The deal for Skiniar is up to Tottenham now.    90min understands, meanwhile, that Spurs are also looking at cheaper options, Gian Marco Ferrari (Sassuolo) and Kim Min-jae (Beijing Guoan).
