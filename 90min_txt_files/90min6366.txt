Valentino Lazaro is unlikely to return to Newcastle next season, with Magpies' boss Steve Bruce reluctant to pay the  £20m fee it would require to make the Austrian's loan deal permanent. The Inter loanee has been restricted to just nine appearances in the league for Newcastle this season, with the likes of Deandre Yedlin and Javier Manquillo regularly selected ahead of him. According to the Northern Echo, manager Bruce isn't willing to spend the  £20m necessary to bring Lazaro back to St James' next season. The right-sided midfielder has impressed a number of times and was said to be open to the idea of signing for Newcastle permanently, but will likely have to look elsewhere for his next move. With the Newcastle takeover saga still ongoing, it's currently unclear what sort of budget the club will have to operate with in the upcoming transfer window, so the club are hesitant on spending a fee around  £20m for someone who is largely considered a backup option.
