Real Madrid midfielder Isco is pushing for a move away from the club in January, though the Spanish giants have no interest in selling him for a cut-price fee. The 28-year-old has fallen down the pecking order at the Santiago Bernabeu and has been afforded just three La Liga starts by Zinedine Zidane this campaign. Rumours have circulated regarding the Spain international's future in the Spanish capital for some time now, and AS understand that he is pursuing a move away from the club in the January transfer window. However, despite Isco's current deal having little more than 18 months left to run, Los Blancos are in no hurry to offload their disgruntled midfielder, and will not entertain bids below his    60m ( Â£55m) valuation, while any loan offers will also reportedly be rebuffed. Interest in the midfielder has been rife of late, with a number of European behemoths monitoring his progress. Juventus, Milan, Sevilla, Everton and most recently Arsenal have all lodged their interest in Isco, though an offer has yet to be tabled for the former Valencia man. Having joined Real in 2013, Isco went on to become an integral part of the sides managed by Carlo Ancelotti and Rafael Benitez. He continued to play a key role in the Real starting XI following the arrival of Zidane in 2016, with Los Blancos going on to win one La Liga title and three Champions Leagues in just three seasons.
