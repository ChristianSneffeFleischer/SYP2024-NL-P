Blackburn Rovers have a huge decision to make in January over the future of Ben Brereton Diaz, with a number of Premier League giants ready to make their move, 90min understands. The 23-year-old's contract at Ewood Park expires at the end of the season and it's understood that he has told the club's hierarchy that he won't be extending his stay. That means promotion chasing Blackburn must now decide whether they want Brereton Diaz to spearhead their Premier League promotion charge - before losing him on a free transfer at the end of the season - or sell up in January when they can still command a fee. Brereton Diaz has nine Championship goals to his name, having bagged 22 goals last season, and scouts have been out in force over the past few weeks to watch him. 90min understands that among the clubs who have been in attendance are Manchester United, who headline a number of interested Premier League parties, while Tottenham, West Ham, Aston Villa, Crystal Palace, Brighton and Wolves have also scouted Brereton Diaz. Leeds, Bournemouth and Everton, meanwhile, are known long-term admirers. The Chilean's options don't stop there, as a glut of teams from across Europe are interested in prising Brereton Diaz away from England.  Serial Europa League winners Sevilla, who are struggling for form this season, are among those looking to offer him a pre-contract agreement in January, while Ajax, Union Berlin, Atalanta, Sassuolo and Salernitana are also showing interest. Brereton Diaz said on Tuesday night that he'd "hopefully" be staying at Blackburn until the end of the season, while manager Jon Dahl Tomasson said when asked about his future: "I think the club wants to keep him and of course, we should always try to keep Ben, want to keep him.
