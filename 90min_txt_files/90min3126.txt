Manchester United are close to signing former Lazio goalkeeper Thomas Strakosha on a free transfer, 90min understands. The 27-year-old is a free agent after leaving Lazio at the end of his contract and he'd previously been on the radar of Premier League new boys Fulham. But the Cottagers have ended up going in a different direction, having also considered hijacking West Ham's deal for Alphonse Areola, and are instead in talks to sign Arsenal's number two goalkeeper Bernd Leno. United, meanwhile, have allowed their number two Dean Henderson to join Nottingham Forest on loan, paving the way for a new goalkeeper to arrive at Old Trafford as understudy to David de Gea. Listen now to 90min's Talking Transfers podcast, with  Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey,  Harry Symeou  &  Toby Cudworth. On the latest show they discuss Cristiano Ronaldo's future at Manchester United, Newcastle preparing to break their transfer record for Moussa Diaby, Bayern Munich's interest in Chelsea target Matthijs de Ligt and more. Available on  all audio platforms  and the  90min YouTube channel. If you can't see the podcast embed, click  here  to download the episode in full! The Red Devils had explored a deal for Sam Johnstone, who himself was available on a free transfer after leaving West Bromwich Albion, but he recently signed for Patrick Vieira's Crystal Palace - where he'll stand a good chance of ousting Vicente Guaita as the club's number one.
