Chelsea have granted winger Callum Hudson-Odoi permission to explore a move away from Stamford Bridge this summer, 90min understands. The 22-year-old recently returned from a frustrating loan spell with Bayer Leverkusen which yielded just seven Bundesliga starts and has now entered the final 12 months of his contract with Chelsea. Following talks between the two parties, Hudson-Odoi is now exploring a move away from his boyhood club and sources have confirmed to 90min that contact has been made with teams from all across the globe. In England, Hudson-Odoi is understood to have attracted interest from Everton, Fulham and Nottingham Forest, but the opportunity to move to mainland Europe with clubs from France, Germany and Italy is also on the table. There is even interest in Hudson-Odoi from Saudi Arabia and Major League Soccer, and all options are being explored as it stands. feed Chelsea are currently looking for a permanent transfer but would be open to a loan with a mandatory purchase clause next summer - an option which would require a 12-month extension of Hudson-Odoi's current contract. Hudson-Odoi has managed 126 appearances for Chelsea since his debut in the 2017/18 season but struggled to hold down a permanent starting place and saw his momentum derailed by injury. An Achilles injury in April 2019 brought his progress under Maurizio Sarri to an abrupt end and a similar problem followed three years later, meaning his last Chelsea appearance came in March 2022 in an FA Cup victory over Luton Town. Chelsea are looking to rejuvenate their attacking lineup this summer and have voiced an interest in Lyon's Rayan Cherki.
