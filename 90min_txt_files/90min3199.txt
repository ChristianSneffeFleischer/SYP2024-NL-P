Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has lauded the club's capture of young attacking midfielder Fabio Carvalho from Fulham. The Reds had pursued the 19-year-old for some time, almost signing him in January before finally agreeing a transfer back in April, with the deal confirmed the following month. Carvalho was in scintillating form in 2021/22 as Fulham won the Championship title and secured promotion back to the top flight, scoring ten times and laying on eight more despite missing a significant chunk of the season with a toe injury followed by a bout of coronavirus. The Portugal Under-21 international was unveiled as a Liverpool player on Sunday after his move became official on 1 July. Speaking upon the announcement, Liverpool head coach Klopp expressed his delight at landing such a talented young player.    It   s great to finally be able to welcome Fabio and to introduce him properly to our supporters,    the German told the club's official website.    What a talent he is, hey? A player who can bring a stadium to its feet. He puts his personality into his performances, he is confident and adventurous with the ball, and he wants to make things happen.    He is a versatile player for sure and is very much an attacking threat with his creativity and dynamism.      It was a wonderful season for Fulham last year and Fabio was a worthy winner of the individual recognition he got as a result of that." However, Klopp also moved to temper initial excitement and expectation about what Carvalho might produce at the very start of his time at Anfield.    It doesn   t really need saying, but it is worth reminding everyone that he will of course need patience," Klopp continued.
