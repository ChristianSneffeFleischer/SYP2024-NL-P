Atletico Madrid president Enrique Cerezo has insisted the club are not interested in making any further signings, despite links to Manchester United forward Cristiano Ronaldo. Cerezo has already gone public to label a move for Ronaldo 'practically impossible', but the rumours have lingered as the United striker continues to push for a move away from Old Trafford in search of Champions League football. A section of Atletico fans even held up a banner voicing their displeasure towards the Ronaldo links - prompting a sarcastic response from the 37-year-old on Instagram. Meanwhile, Atletico have just completed a deal to sign right-back Nahuel Molina, and during his presentation, Cerezo sent a clear message that a move for Ronaldo was not going to happen. "With this signing, our sports management manages to add the last piece we were looking for," Cerezo said. "I repeat to our journalist friends, with this signing, our sports management manages to add the last piece we were looking for."
