Edwin van der Sar has confirmed that Ajax wasted little time in rejecting Arsenal's summer bid for centre-back Lisandro Martinez before his eventual move to Manchester United. The Argentine endured a tricky start to life in England but has enjoyed some excellent performances in recent weeks, living up to the expectations that came with his  Â£56.7m move from Amsterdam during the summer. Ajax had planned on keeping Martinez following the departure of manager Erik ten Hag to United, and Van der Sar has now confessed that a bid from Arsenal was rejected earlier in the window.    It was our opinion they should stay for another year,    he told The Times of both Martinez and winger Antony, who eventually moved to United as well.    We gave a firm    no    to Arsenal when they came first for Lisandro; we fought hard to keep him.    Scott Saunders  hosts  Graeme Bailey  and  Toby Cudworth  in the latest episode of Talking Transfers. The team discuss Chelsea's search for a new striker, the growing interest in Napoli rising star Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, Newcastle's plans for Bruno Guimaraes and more.
