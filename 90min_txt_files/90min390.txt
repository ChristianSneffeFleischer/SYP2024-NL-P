UEFA have confirmed Manchester United and Barcelona have been fined for failing to abide by their financial regulations. The European governing body drew up a lengthy list of clubs whose financial dealings between 2019 and 2022 would be monitored amid concerns over potential breaches of rules, with both United and Barcelona under observation. With all financial reports now submitted, UEFA have studied the numbers and ruled that the two clubs fell marginally short of requirements and have issued minor fines. United reported 'minor break-even deficits' and have been handed a    300,000 fine - three times as high as the other two clubs in the same situation, Konyaspor and APOEL FC of Turkey and Cyprus respectively. As for Barcelona, their fine of    500,000 stems from the misreporting of 'profits on disposal of intangible assets (other than player transfers) which are not a relevant income under the regulations'. feed A further nine clubs were monitored during the 2022/23 season after being set financial targets by UEFA, with French side Lille meeting the criteria and being removed from the watch list as a result. AC Milan, Monaco, Roma, Besiktas, Inter, Marseille and PSG all reached their targets for the 2022 financial year but will remain under observation to ensure compliance in 2023. Istanbul Basaksehir of Turkey fell short of their targets and have been hit with a    400,000 fine.
