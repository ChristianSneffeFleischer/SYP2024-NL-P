Sevilla have reached an agreement to sign former Real Madrid midfielder Isco, subject to a medical. The 30-year-old departed the La Liga champions upon the expiration of his contract at the end of last season, lifting the Champions League on five separate occasions while winning three La Liga titles and a Copa del Rey during his time in Madrid. A statement from Sevilla reads: "Sevilla FC has reached an agreement in principle with the player Francisco Rom  n Alarc  n Su  rez, known in football as Isco, for his incorporation as Sevilla FC's third signing for the 2022/23 season. "The attacker is already in Seville to undergo the medical examination this Monday. If all goes well, he will sign his contract for the next two seasons." Isco will be reunited with former manager Julen Lopetegui, who endured an ill-fated spell as Real Madrid manager in 2018. The midfielder made his breakthrough at Valencia, before joining Malaga in the summer of 2011. Isco played a starring role as the Andulasian outfit reached the Champions League knockout stages in 2013 under the guidance of Manuel Pellegrini. Real Madrid swooped to secure the Spaniard's signature at the end of that season, with Isco helping the club secure La Decima in Lisbon against Atletico Madrid before making over 230 appearances for Los Blancos.
