Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti has confirmed winger Marco Asensio is looking to leave the club this summer, Asensio was Real's third-top scorer last season but has plummeted down the pecking order under Ancelotti this year, with the boss making it clear there will be limited minutes for the 26-year-old if he chooses to stay. Talk of a departure had been minimal up to this point but Ancelotti has now confirmed Asensio is looking elsewhere. "I think he is looking at something to see if he can leave," the boss told Movistar. "If he does not leave, he will continue to be a Madrid player."
