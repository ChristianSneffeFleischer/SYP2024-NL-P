Jetro Willems has rejected a new contract offer from Eintracht Frankfurt, opening the door for a return to Newcastle. The Dutchman spent last campaign on loan at St James' Park, making 20 appearances before returning to his parent club in June after suffering a season ending ACL injury. Before he departed, Willems spoke warmly about his time in the north east, promising he would '100% return' if the opportunity presented itself. Newcastle's hope of re-signing the fan favourite have been given a boost by the 26-year-old turning down the offer of a new deal at Frankfurt. Willems' current contract expires in the summer and he has indicated to the Eagles' hierarchy that he wants to depart the club. The Magpies would be free to negotiate a pre-contract deal with Willems in January and according to his agent, the player would welcome a return to Tyneside.  "Jetro felt very comfortable at Newcastle and he said he felt like it was home, so of course he would be happy to go back if the chance came up," Sigi Lens told ChronicleLive. Many happy returns to @JetroWillems_15 on his birthday! ?? #NUFC pic.twitter.com/jmomrSJuZk "It is a great club and he had a great time in England. Newcastle were very good after the injury so it is something he would be happy with if the opportunity came up. He is fully fit and ready to play now."
