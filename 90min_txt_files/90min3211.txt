Troyes defender Giulian Biancone is due in England on Saturday for a medical ahead of a transfer to Nottingham Forest, 90min understands. The 22-year-old is a right-back by trade but has played anywhere across Troyes' defensive line and ended last season as a left-sided centre-back in a back three, helping his side avoid relegation from Ligue 1. His versatility has caught the eye of Forest boss Steve Cooper, who is preparing for the team's return to the Premier League with a handful of expensive signings, and sources have confirmed that Biancone is set to undergo a medical on Saturday ahead of putting pen to paper. Cooper, who deploys a three-man defence of his own at Forest, could choose to use Biancone at centre-back as 90min understands the newly promoted side remain keen to sign a new right-back to replace Djed Spence. Spence returned to Middlesbrough upon the completion of his loan with Forest, who were keen to re-sign him this summer, but the 21-year-old is close to joining Tottenham instead.
