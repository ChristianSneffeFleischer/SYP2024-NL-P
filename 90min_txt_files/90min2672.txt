Thiago Alcantara, Fabinho, Curtis Jones, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Harvey Elliott, Jordan Henderson and James Milner. In theory, that's not a terrible list of midfield options. In practice, when three of the players are injured, three are over-30, and you just watched three be overrun by a midfield which contained Scott McTominay, maybe these midfield options aren't so great. That's why basically every Liverpool fan on Twitter has been calling for their club to make a splash and sign a new midfielder before the deadline. And here's a few options Liverpool should consider: On Monday evening it was pretty clear that Liverpool lacked a real driving force in midfield. Nicolo Barella is exactly that. A driving force. A player who can drag a team upfield with one swift dribble up the park. Sure, it's not the most realistic option on this list but it might just be the best.  Another Inter player, but a very different one. While Barella is the box-to-box driving force, Brozovic is a midfielder who sits in and does the dirty work - winning midfield battles with his aggression and clever manipulation of the ball.He's been pretty successful in this role at Inter, bagging himself a Scudetto and a Coppa Italia in the last two seasons.  First off, let's just call a spade a spade: Youri Tielemans has been awful for about a year.  And he has been awful because he's thrown a bit of a wobbler and doesn't want to play for Leicester City anymore. That said, in the right situation - a club he actually wants to play for - Tielemans can thrive. Liverpool could be that club.
