Ajax forward Brian Brobbey, who was a summer transfer target for Manchester United, has admitted that moving to Old Trafford would be a dream come true. The 20-year-old was linked with a move to United, where he would have reunited with former manager Erik ten Hag, but he opted to rejoin Ajax on a permanent basis after returning on loan from RB Leipzig at the end of 2021. Brobbey had moved to Germany just five months prior but struggled to hold down a first team place at Leipzig, making just nine appearances in the Bundesliga. His return to Amsterdam, where he worked under Ten Hag, was hugely successful, and he scored seven goals in 11 games to help Ajax win a 36th Eredivisie title ahead of rivals PSV Eindhoven.  That form led to speculation that Brobbey could follow Ten Hag to Old Trafford, with a move to Manchester rumoured early in the transfer window. Ultimately, Brobbey decided to stay in the Netherlands, but has now admitted that Ten Hag had been in touch over a possible move.
