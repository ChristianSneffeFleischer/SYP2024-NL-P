Tottenham have agreed to meet Empoli's    20m asking price for goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario, 90min understands. Spurs had been keen to strike a deal for Brentford's David Raya but were reluctant to come anywhere close to the Bees'  £40m asking price and have since turned their attention to Italy international Vicario. Empoli have asked for a fee of    20m to part ways with their goalkeeper, who joined them permanently last summer and kept seven clean sheets in 31 Serie A appearances, and sources have confirmed to 90min that Spurs are happy to strike a deal at that price. Numerous Italian sides have been looking at Vicario, with Inter previously seen as favourites to land the 26-year-old as their replacement for the in-demand Andre Onana, but Spurs have moved quickly to try and fend off the competition. Talks have already been held between Spurs and Vicario, who is understood to be ready to move to England this summer. feed Vicario is now expected to arrive and take the place of Hugo Lloris, who has one year left on his contract but has confirmed his desire to leave Spurs in the coming weeks. Strengthening in goal has been a top priority this summer for Spurs and they had hoped to lure Raya across London, but Brentford stood firm on their  £40m asking price, despite the fact the Spaniard has just one year remaining on his contract. Raya, who has also been linked with the likes of Chelsea and Manchester United, recently admitted he was concerned his high price tag could prevent him from leaving this summer. Finding a cheaper goalkeeper will afford Spurs more flexibility in pursuit of other targets. Leicester midfielder James Maddison is high on the wish list but has been hit with a huge  £60m asking price.
