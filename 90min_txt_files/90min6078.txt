Juventus are not interested in pursuing a deal to sign Brescia's Sandro Tonali, despite previous reports linking them with a move for the highly-rated youngster. The midfielder is continually being linked with a big move this summer as clubs at the top of Serie A look set to fight for his signature. Juve's 'interest' isn't to be, however, according to Goal's Juventus correspondent Romeo Agresti. He confirmed the news in a tweet, quashing their interest despite seemingly being keen on breathing new life into their midfield. La #Juventus NON entrer   in corsa per #Tonali // Juventus will NOT join in the race to sign Tonali                @GoalItalia @goal Juve have been linked with a number of midfielders this summer and are set to sell Blaise Matuidi to Inter Miami, as they look to reshape the squad under the management of Andrea Pirlo. Aaron Ramsey's future has also been thrown into doubt, with reports suggesting that the Old Lady are prepared to sell him this summer after just one season in Turin. Tonali has attracted interest from a number of sides - including Juve's Serie A rivals Inter - following an impressive 2019/20 season. A defensive midfielder by trade, his performances in Serie A have been enough to catch the eyes of a number of clubs. His side's relegation to Serie B make his sale more likely. Despite Brescia being relegated, however, club owner Massimo Cellino has put a    40m price tag on Tonali's head according to reports in Italy (via the Daily Mail), with interest in the Italian youngster so high.
