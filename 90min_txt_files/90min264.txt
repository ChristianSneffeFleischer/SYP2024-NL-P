Fulham and Lazio are both battling for the signature of Chelsea winger Callum Hudson-Odoi, 90min understands. Hudson-Odoi was left out of Chelsea's pre-season squad to continue negotiations over a move away from his boyhood club, with everyone involved ready to part ways with summer. The winger has attracted interest from across the globe but sources have confirmed to 90min that Lazio and Fulham have both ramped up conversations with Hudson-Odoi to try and get a deal done. Lazio attempted to steal an early march on proceedings by reaching out to the player at a time when Fulham's transfer plans were in limbo due to uncertainty surrounding manager Marco Silva, whose decision to reject Saudi Arabian side Al Ahli has now allowed the Cottagers to focus on new signings. The Serie A side are led by former Chelsea boss Maurizio Sarri, who is keen on a reunion with Hudson-Odoi and can offer the 22-year-old the chance to play in the Champions League. feed Fulham, however, hope that the chance to remain in London will help them convince Hudson-Odoi to make the short trip from Stamford Bridge to Craven Cottage. With Silva now confirmed in place, Fulham have accelerated talks with Hudson-Odoi, who has managed 126 appearances for Chelsea since first making his debut during the 2017/18 campaign, and are pushing to get a deal done. Hudson-Odoi's entourage have also been spoken to by Crystal Palace but the Eagles have not advanced their interest at this point. Talks with Palace are completely separate to any negotiations over Frenchman Michael Olise, who has been earmarked for a return to Stamford Bridge this summer.
