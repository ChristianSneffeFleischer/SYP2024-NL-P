Nice manager Francesco Farioli has confessed Manchester United's interest in centre-back Jean-Clair Todibo could leave them powerless to keep the Frenchman. United are on the cusp of selling Harry Maguire to West Ham United for  £30m and have identified former Barcelona defender Todibo as a potential replacement for the Englishman. One of the top performers in Ligue 1 last season, Todibo is rated incredibly highly by everyone at Nice, including new manager Farioli, but while the boss wants to keep Todibo, he admitted he could not guarantee no business would be done. "I also have two vice-captains Khephren Thuram and Jean-Clair Todibo who are among the best players in the team," Farioli told the media. "We would like both players to stay until the end of the season, but you cannot escape the reality of the transfer window. We'll see what happens. As long as they're here, I'm enjoying having them." feed He continued: "Of course we would like Todibo to stay, but it can be complicated. We have to wait to see who will want to buy him and if everyone finds an agreement there.  "He is a leader, a very strong player mentally, he has improved a lot and he is ready to reach the very top level." United have drawn up a sizeable list of potential replacements for Maguire. Alongside Todibo, there is also interest in Torino's Perr Schuurs and Everton's Jarrad Branthwaite, while Bayer Leverkusen's Edmond Tapsoba is seen as an expensive alternative. The Red Devils have also been offered the chance to sign versatile Bayern Munich defender Benjamin Pavard, who is in the final year of his contract and is expected to be available for a fee similar to the  £30m United are in line to receive for Maguire.
