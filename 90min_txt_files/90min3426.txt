Barcelona manager Xavi is targeting more signings in the summer, with Thursday's Europa League exit conveying the need for more investment. Bar  a were favourites to win Europe's secondary competition but were 3-0 down by the 70th minute, with late strikes from Sergio Busquets and Memphis Depay not enough to turn the tie around. Though Andreas Christensen and Franck Kessie are set to sign for the Catalan giants in the summer, more options in the squad are required if they are to push on and compete again after a drop-off in performances, since arrested by Xavi's arrival. CCMA claim they are targeting defensive reinforcements in both full-back areas. A player to compete with Jordi Alba is required, while the possible departures of Dani Alves and Sergi  o Dest have also raised the importance of bringing in another right-back. Despite a promising start, Adama Traore's influence has waned with other attacking stars preferred and he is not expected to stay at Camp Nou beyond the summer. A new centre-forward may be needed, too. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has proven to be an excellent stop-gap, scoring eight goals in La Liga since his January move, but at 32 years of age his time at the top level may be coming to an end. Erling Haaland is admired in Catalonia, though 90min understands Bar  a will face competition from Manchester City, who are pressing ahead with transfer talks with Borussia Dortmund.
