West Ham are interested in signing Brentford winger Said Benrahma to replace Felipe Anderson, who has joined FC Porto on loan. Benrahma was part of the Bees side that fell agonisingly short in the 2020 Championship playoff final against Fulham. The Algerian was in terrific form all season long, registering 17 goals and nine assists in 43 league appearances.  Ever since Thomas Frank's side failed to secure Premier League promotion, Benrahma has been linked with a move to the top flight, but nothing has materialised as of yet.  That could change though, with the Standard reporting West Ham's interest in bringing the mercurial winger to the club - interest that will bolster David Moyes' attacking options after Anderson'sdeparture to Porto. The Brazilian will be hoping the move can reignite his stuttering career. After enjoying an impressive debut 2018/2019 season, the 27-year-old struggled last season. Anderson made 25 Premier League appearances but notched up just five direct goal involvements as West Ham narrowly avoided relegation. Benrahma has the potential to be a significant upgrade and the Hammers will be hoping to get a deal over the line before the domestic transfer window slams shut on October 16.  The Brentford man is not Moyes' only target, however. It is understood that West Ham are also interested in Watford centre-back Craig Dawson. The 30-year-old only arrived at Vicarage Road last summer, but he's been told that he can leave Hertfordshire as new Hornets boss Vladimir Ivic looks to reshape his squad after relegation last year.
