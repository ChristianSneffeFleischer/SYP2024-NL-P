Leeds United are in advanced talks to sign midfielder Michael Cuisance from Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich. Leeds have signed players in a number of positions to bring their squad up to Premier League standard, but still lack some extra legs in midfield and have turned their attentions to the 21-year-old. Foot Mercato first reported that Leeds had made a 'concrete' move to sign Cuisance ahead of other interested parties such as Marseille. The interest has since been reported on further by Fabrizio Romano, who states Leeds have submitted a    20m ( Â£18.1m) bid for the midfielder and already agreed personal terms until June 2025. Leeds have agreed personal terms with Cuisance to the delight of head coach Marcelo Bielsa, who is believed to be a huge admirer of the 21-year-old, but do still face some competition from Marseille. The French side are only interested in a loan deal, however. The news of an imminent departure for Cuisance escalated this weekend when it emerged he had been left out of the Bayern squad this weekend during their shock 4-1 defeat to Hoffenheim. Head coach Hansi Flick didn't entertain the speculation in his post-match press conference, stating as quoted by Leeds Live: "Musiala was in the squad instead of Cuisance because he did very well recently."
