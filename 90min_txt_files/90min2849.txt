Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel has said that he is targeting further signings this transfer window to help the Blues reach a 'new level'. Tuchel has repeatedly insisted that Chelsea are in a state of transition following Todd Boehly's takeover of the club, but does not want to compromise on expectations. Speaking to Sky Sports after Saturday's gritty 1-0 win at Everton, Tuchel revealed that the west Londoners are still looking to bring in more players this month. "If we can add, we add. Maybe not necessarily midfielders as the first option but we are open for everything and I think we can use new energy, new legs and fresh input to bring us to a new level," he said. "If not, then we will push this team but I think we could use some input and more quality. We are on it but we will not tell you!"
