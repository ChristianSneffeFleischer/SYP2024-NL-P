Leeds United are confident they will strike a deal to sign Weston McKennie on loan from Juventus, 90min understands, but the two sides remain in talks over the terms of a purchase clause. McKennie is out of favour in Turin and has agreed to join fellow United States national Jesse Marsch at Elland Road, with Leeds first suggesting a loan move due to the financial restraints stemming from Georginio Rutter's    30m move to the club earlier this month. Juventus are happy to accept a loan and have made that clear to Leeds, with the two clubs also discussing a future permanent transfer that could be worth close to    30m. The Serie A side are pushing for Leeds to agree to an obligation to sign McKennie permanently, but the Whites are favouring an option instead. While a final agreement has yet to be reached, the expectancy is that the two sides will strike a deal in the near future to make McKennie the next reinforcement for Marsch.
