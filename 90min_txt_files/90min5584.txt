West Ham United are lining up a move for Club Brugge star Hans Vanaken in the summer transfer window, but the Hammers will have to part with a substantial fee to land the exciting midfielder.  Coach David Moyes is desperate to add some reinforcements to his squad, having lost the opening two games of the season, and he is particularly keen to inject some goals into his midfield alternatives.  So, Vanaken could be the ideal candidate to save West Ham this season, given he has scored four times and assisted twice in Club Brugge's opening six matches. The Belgian star has also played his way into the national team of late, and his admirers are growing rapidly.  But a source close to the Hammers has stated that the east London club are preparing a bid for the 28-year-old, ahead of the transfer window's closure on October 5, according to Football Insider. However, Vanaken's current contract runs until the summer of 2024, meaning David Sullivan and David Gold will have to stump up a significant sum of cash to land the goalscoring midfielder.  He is considered to be one of the best in his position in Belgium, and boasts an impressive scoring record, bagging 74 goals in 250 appearances and also notching 56 assists. These statistics are hard to ignore for a club like West Ham, who are severely lacking goals in their side - other than the recently prolific Michail Antonio.
