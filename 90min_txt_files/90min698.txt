The agent of Achraf Hakimi has admitted that the right-back would be interested in a return to Real Madrid this summer. Though a Morocco international, Hakimi was born and raised in Madrid, coming through the youth ranks at Los Blancos and playing 17 times for the first team. Hakimi joined Borussia Dortmund on a two-year loan in 2018 before signing for Inter on a permanent transfer. He established himself as one of the best attacking full-backs in the world, but then left for Paris Saint-Germain after just one season at San Siro due to the Nerazzurri's financial issues. At PSG, Hakimi has continued his ascension and it is an area of the pitch that Real Madrid have struggled to fill in recent seasons. In an interview with AS, Hakimi's agent, Alejandro Camano, opened the door to a return to the Santiago Bernabeu. feed "Achraf has been away from Real Madrid for five years, but it is always his home, somewhere in his heart the club is there," Camano said. "If Real Madrid want to sign him, we will listen. If you ask him you will see that he is a Real Madrid fan, but our project now is that of PSG. "Great players always see Real Madrid as a target. How many players would want to go there? Achraf lived it, and has been formed with the club's values." Hakimi was given preliminary charges of rape by prosecutors back in March following an alleged incident at his Paris home. He is currently allowed to leave French territories but cannot make contact with the accuser.
