Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain are both hopeful that French footballing authorities will sanction Hakim Ziyech's loan move, sources have confirmed to 90min. The deal for Ziyech was expected to go through ahead of the transfer deadline closing on Tuesday evening. However, the paperwork to complete the deal was not filed in time. Though there was an issue on both PSG and Chelsea's ends, there was also a problem with the computer system at the LFP - French football's governing body. PSG are appealing the decision and they firmly believe that due to the technical difficulties, the move should be approved. They have been locked in talks with the LFP over the appeal and a decision is expected to be made via the authorities' legal committee on Wednesday.
