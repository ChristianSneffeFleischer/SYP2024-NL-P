LA Galaxy and FC Barcelona finally confirmed the transfer of right back Julian Araujo.   The Mexican national team right back secured his long-desired move to La Liga, earning a club-record $4m transfer to Barcelona on Friday     over two weeks past the January window closing. The defender   s move from LA Galaxy to Barcelona initially fell through during deadline day after FIFA confirmed the documentation for the transfer was filed too late. Despite both teams filing an appeal for the deal, the global football governing body denied the case.   Barcelona director of football Mateu Alemany confirmed a 'system error' caused his club to miss the midnight deadline at the end of the transfer window by a matter of just 18 seconds.   But after several attempts, Araujo finally sealed his transfer to Spain's top division. "Julian joining FC Barcelona is a great story of a young kid from Southern California coming into the LA Galaxy Academy, through LA Galaxy II and excelling with the first team,    said LA Galaxy head coach and sporting director Greg Vanney. "As we continue to evolve as a club, we   re leaning heavily into the LA Galaxy Academy development side. We are going to help develop players who can play at the biggest clubs in the world, but can also help the LA Galaxy win championships. We wish Juli  n all the best in the next phase of his career." The defender signed a deal through the 2026 campaign. The Galaxy will retain a sell-on percentage of the transfer fee if Araujo is sold to another club. The move is a dream come true for the player, who affirmed his desire to move abroad in an exclusive interview with 90min.      I definitely want to go to Europe. It   s my dream. My goal is to go to Europe. I want to reach my highest potential and I feel like going to Europe is going to help me do that,    he said to 90min.
