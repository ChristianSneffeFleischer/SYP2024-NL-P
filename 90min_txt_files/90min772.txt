Manchester United are continuing talks with David de Gea over a new contract, though they are also keeping a watchful eye on the goalkeeper market, sources have told 90min. The Spaniard's deal expires at the end of the month, and the Red Devils revealed last week that they are still locked in negotiations with the 32-year-old when announcing their retained list. 90min reported earlier this month that De Gea had received a lucrative offer from the Saudi Pro League, but was expected to turn it down in favour of staying at Old Trafford. But less than a fortnight remains on De Gea's current deal and he is still yet to reach an agreement with Man Utd. In the meantime, 90min understands that Man Utd have been weighing up a move for a new goalkeeper in the transfer market. feed Man Utd's top targets are Porto's Diogo Costa and Brentford's David Raya. The latter is currently in talks with Tottenham, who are unwilling to meet the Bees'  Â£40m asking price, but the Red Devils could stump up that sum and scupper Spurs' plans. Erik ten Hag also remains a huge fan of Andre Onana having worked with the Cameroonian at Ajax. 90min first reported in February that Inter may need to sell him in order to balance their books, while Chelsea have cooled their recent interest in the 27-year-old. Should De Gea sign a new contract, then it is less likely that Man Utd spend a huge amount on a new goalkeeper. Bayern Munich's Yann Sommer is a target for if the Spaniard does sign on.
