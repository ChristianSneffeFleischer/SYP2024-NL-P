Manchester United target Antony will likely stay at Ajax this summer, according to the Dutch champions' new head coach Alfred Schreuder.  The Brazil winger has been a target of Man Utd's for some time, with 90min reporting in March that they were keeping tabs on him even prior to Erik ten Hag's arrival from Amsterdam. The Red Devils have been locked in talks regarding Antony but are not close to agreeing a fee, and Schreuder has poured more cold water on Man Utd's hopes by insisting Ajax have already shifted enough players - including Lisandro Martinez to Ten Hag's new side - this window already. When asked if he is afraid of Antony leaving, Schreuder replied: "No, no. We have sold a certain amount of players and I am expecting nobody else to leave. We talk on a daily basis. It would be very bad for us if we would lose another starting player." 90min understands Man Utd have been offered the chance to re-sign Memphis Depay from Barcelona, though he is not currently a target under consideration.
