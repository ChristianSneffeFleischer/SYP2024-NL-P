Tottenham Hotspur have confirmed the signing of Alejo Veliz from Rosario Central, subject to international clearance and a work permit. The 19-year-old has put pen to paper on a contract until 2029 and becomes Spurs' seventh permanent addition of a busy summer transfer window. The club announced the arrival of Micky van de Ven from Wolfsburg earlier on Tuesday. "It's like I'm touching the heavens," Veliz said during his announcement video. feed Veliz will take the number 36 shirt and joins Tottenham for a  Â£13m fee. 90min reported last week that Spurs were going to win the race for the highly-rated striker, with AC Milan, AS Roma, Nottingham Forest, and Salernitana also interested in his signature. While Veliz arrives to bolster Spurs' attacking options, his arrival is unlikely to have much bearing on the future of Harry Kane. 90min understands that Kane will stay put in north London for the 2023/24 season if a move away does not transpire before the new Premier League campaign begins this weekend. Bayern Munich have had three Kane bids rejected by Tottenham and are contemplating making a fourth, while the German champions are also beginning to look at alternate options.
