The 23-year-old has signed a five-year deal with the newly crowned European champions and will wear the number 22 shirt at the Allianz Arena in 2020/21. #ServusMarc ?We are delighted to announce the signing of Marc Roca! #MiaSanMia @marcroca21 pic.twitter.com/QmdqtNSNSV Speaking on his move, Marc Roca told Bayern's official website:    I   m very happy.
