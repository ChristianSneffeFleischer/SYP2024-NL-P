Chelsea are among the sides to have been scouting Porto goalkeeper Diogo Costa in recent games, 90min understands, with the Blues set to address their goalkeeping situation in the summer. World-record signing Kepa Arrizabalaga was dropped following the arrival of Edouard Mendy in 2020, but the Spaniard has been a regular starter under Graham Potter because of a handful of injury issues for Mendy. Both Kepa and Mendy, aged 28 and 30 respectively, are out of contract in 2025 and so Chelsea are approaching the point at which decisions will have to be made about the future of the two stoppers. While the club's current focus is on securing the future of midfielder Mason Mount, whose deal expires one year earlier in 2024, sources have confirmed to 90min that Chelsea's recruitment team are making plans to address their goalkeeping situation going forward. With a new signing a possibility, Chelsea scouts have been active across Europe and 90min understands that Blues representatives have been in the stands to watch Costa in recent weeks. 23-year-old Costa, who is also of significant interest to Manchester United as they prepare to make a decision on David de Gea's future, was Portugal's starter at the World Cup and has kept 13 clean sheets in 25 games this season, including three in the Champions League Chelsea have taken in Costa's recent performances alongside scouts from both United and Tottenham, but the Blues' recruitment team have also been looking at potential options from inside the Premier League.
