Fulham and Barcelona could announce an agreement for the Premier League outfit to sign defender Jean-Clair Todibo in just a matter of hours, after the Cottagers offered to pay    18m as well as add-ons for his services.  Fulham have looked to take a different and more measured approach to the transfer market this summer, in comparison to their activity when they were last promoted for the 2018/19 season.  But while they have now brought in eight players this summer, they have yet to strengthen in perhaps the most concerning area of all, in central defence. After the Cottagers were brushed aside 3-0 by Aston Villa, vice-chairman Tony Khan took to Twitter to apologise for the lacklustre display and insisted that the club are doing everything possible to sign a new centre-back. His remarks didn't go down well with many, but it was a clear indicator that Fulham are fully aware of their defensive problems.  One name who has been mentioned is Barcelona's Todibo, and SPORT now report that a deal is close. In fact, the south-west Londoners have offered around    18m as well as further add-ons for the 20-year-old, and the report claims that an agreement between the two clubs could be reached within a matter of hours.  Todibo is keen to play regular first team football this term, something that Ronald Koeman cannot guarantee him. With the summer transfer deadline fast approaching, Bar  a have now accelerated their plans to offload Todibo as they look to continue raising funds, while also granting the defender his wish of regular playing time.  But should he make the switch to Craven Cottage, it is 'very likely' that la Blaugrana will insert a buyback clause into any deal.
