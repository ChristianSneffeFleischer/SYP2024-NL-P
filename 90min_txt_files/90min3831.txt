Young German talent Florian Wirtz has his heart set on a move to Bayern Munich - but the Bavarian giants will have to play the long game if they want to get their man. Wirtz has become the latest prodigy to emerge from Bayer Leverkusen's academy, following in the footsteps of the likes of Kai Havertz and Leroy Sane. While the 18-year-old enjoyed a breakthrough campaign for the Werkself last season, scoring an impressive eight goals and providing the same number of assists, he has started 2021/22 in absolutely electric form - netting four times and laying on four more in just five Bundesliga games and becoming the youngest player to reach ten goals in the history of the German top flight. Although the attacking midfielder missed out on a place in Joachim Low's plans for Euro 2020, he has since established himself in Hansi Flick's new-look Germany squad. As is customary whenever a young German shows even the slightest bit of talent, Bundesliga juggernaut Bayern Munich are among a host of clubs said to be interested in the player.  Liverpool, Manchester United and Arsenal are the Premier League who have been linked with Wirtz in the past, but according to Christian Falk (via Fabrizio Romano's Twitch channel), the teenager is most attracted to Die Roten. Informal talks have been held with between Bayern's sporting director Hasan Salihamidzic and Wirtz's father and agent Hans-Joachim, and his son's eyes supposedly 'light up' at the prospect of a move to the Allianz Arena. However, speaking to Bild earlier this week, Wirtz Sr. said that his son had no plans to leave Leverkusen any time soon.
