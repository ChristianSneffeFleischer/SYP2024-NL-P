Tottenham's managing director of football Fabio Paratici has poured water on suggestions that Spurs could overhaul their squad in the January transfer window following Antonio Conte's arrival as head coach. The former Chelsea and Inter manager signed a deal until the summer of 2023 on Tuesday, replacing Nuno Espirito Santo in the dugout in north London. Conte's first game in charge of Tottenham comes at home to Vitesse in the Europa Conference League on Thursday, for which Paratici took the pre-match press conference due to the quick turnaround in coaches. After thanking Nuno and his staff for their services to the club, Paratici explained that the club believe in the abilities of the current playing squad. When asked if he's spoken to Conte about potential transfers yet, Paratici said: "Not at all. We trust in our players. We are focused to be better and like a team. "We don't speak about players until now. We have to be focused on our team. I think the team is competitive. We have very good players so we don't speak about players now. It's not the right time." Paratici was also dismissive of talk that Conte's arrival could convince Harry Kane to stay at the club. The England captain was heavily linked with a move to Manchester City in the summer, but the Premier League champions never submitted an offer close to Spurs' valuation and Kane remained at the club. It was reported on Tuesday that Kane was impressed by the level of ambition Tottenham showed in hiring Conte and he is excited to work under him, but Paratici said the appointment is not just about helping and appeasing Spurs' talisman.
