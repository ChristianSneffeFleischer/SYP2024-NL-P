Bayer Leverkusen have contacted Manchester United over a January deal for defender Brandon Williams, according to reports in Germany. Williams enjoyed a breakthrough campaign last season, making 36 appearances in all competitions. He primarily operated as a left-back, although he is equally as comfortable on the right, but has found first team action harder to come by during 2020/21, featuring for just 246 minutes in all competitions this season.  Leverkusen are on the lookout for a replacement for Santiago Arias, who suffered a season ending injury back in October. The Colombian only joined Die Werkself on loan in the summer and managed just one appearance before suffering a broken leg and ankle ligament damage while on international duty.  According to Sky Sports, Bayer have earmarked Williams as a potential replacement, and are interested in taking him to Germany on a permanent basis. United, however, are only willing to sanction a loan move. Leverkusen have enjoyed an extremely impressive start to the season and currently sit second in the Bundesliga, just two points adrift of leaders Bayern Munich. Despite losing talisman Kai Havertz to Chelsea in the summer, Peter Bosz's side look well placed to return to the Champions League next campaign but are mindful that they needed added depth in their squad. If they continue to pursue Williams, they will face competition for his signature from Southampton among others. The Saints were keen to recruit him in the summer, only for United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to block an exit from Old Trafford.
