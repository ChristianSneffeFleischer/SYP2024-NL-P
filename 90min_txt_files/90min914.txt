Borussia Monchengladbach sporting director Roland Virkus has made it clear that they are prepared to sell midfielder Manu Kone to Liverpool for the right price. Having already landed the bargain signing of Alexis Mac Allister from Brighton, Liverpool are hard at work trying to find another new midfielder. Kone has attracted plenty of interest from across Europe but the Reds have stepped up their pursuit of the 22-year-old in recent weeks by opening talks with his representatives. While Gladbach are understood to be keen to keep hold of Kone, director Virkus has admitted that the club will sell him, or any other player, if their valuations are met. "Our attitude is well-known," Virkus told kicker. "If there are sums involved that a club like Borussia has to think about, we will do it." feed Kone is by no means the only option under consideration by Liverpool, who have also spoken to the representatives of fellow Frenchman Khephren Thuram, who discussed his future recently and insisted he was in no rush to leave Nice. Chelsea's Mason Mount, Bayern Munich's Ryan Gravenberch, Wolves' Ruben Neves and former Leicester man Youri Tielemans are all on Liverpool's lengthy shortlist as well as the Reds seek to continue their midfield rebuild. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, James Milner and Naby Keita have all left the club this summer, with the latter inking a deal to return to the Bundesliga with Werder Bremen. Arthur has also returned to Juventus after his loan expired. Another midfielder, 20-year-old Fabio Carvalho, will be allowed to leave on loan this summer amid frustrations over his limited minutes last season.
