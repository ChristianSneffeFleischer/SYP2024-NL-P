Flamengo have confirmed the arrival of Brazilian midfielder Andreas Pereira on a season-long loan from Manchester United. The 25-year-old spent last season with Serie A side Lazio, who declined to take up their option to sign Pereira permanently after watching him offer up just one goal and four assists in 33 appearances in Italy. Pereira entered the final two years of his contract this summer and United had hoped to find a permanent buyer, but the midfielder snubbed other offers in favour of a return to his native Brazil with Flamengo, who did not propose a permanent move. Now, Flamengo have confirmed on their official website they have brought Pereira in one a 12-month loan which will also include the option to sign him full-time next year. There is no official mention of where that fee stands, but according to The Athletic, it could be close to    20m ( £17m). He joins a Flamengo side who also added Chelsea winger Kenedy on loan earlier this month, as well as everyone's favourite Football Manager wonderkid, striker Gabriel Barbosa. Pereira has managed 75 appearances for United, the last of which came towards the end of the 2019/20 season, when it looked like he could be set for a career resurgence under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.
