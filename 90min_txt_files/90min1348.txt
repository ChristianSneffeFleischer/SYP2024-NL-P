Leeds United sporting director Victor Orta has confirmed the club's interest in landing in-demand Barcelona teenager Ilias Akhomach. The teenager, who turns 19 in April, is out-of-contract this summer and Barca have accepted he will be leaving Camp Nou. Barca will allow him to depart on a free, but will insist on a percentage of any future profits from the club he joins. Leeds are very keen on the right winger, but they not alone with their interest, and 90min understands that Arsenal, Brentford, Brighton and Wolves also have an interested in bringing him to England. Sevilla, Monaco and AC Milan are also keen on the young Catalan, but Leeds are hopeful that Akhomach will opt for Elland Road. READ NEXT manual    He is a footballer whose contract ends, and there are many teams in the race to get his services,     Orta told Relevo.    It   s going to be complicated. A player with so much talent, in such a special contractual situation, is going to be very difficult. We   ll see who gets him.      He is a decisive player, a Spanish talent, trained in Barcelona that puts you in another echelon.    But I do not know. He has earned the ability to choose his next sporting step and the one he chooses will surely be good for him, for his family and for his camp, that will surely help him make the right choice.    Leeds and Barcelona do already have a good off-field  relationship having done deals for Junior Firpo and Raphinha in recent seasons.
