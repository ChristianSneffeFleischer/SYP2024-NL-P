Shakhtar Donetsk owner and president Rinat Akhmetov has donated a substantial chunk of Mykhailo Mudryk's transfer fee to providing supplies for Ukraine's war effort. 22-year-old Mudryk joined Chelsea in a deal worth  £87m on Sunday, after the Blues hijacked a move to Premier League rivals, and leaders, Arsenal. Mudryk was introduced to Chelsea's supporters during the half-time interval of the 1-0 win over Crystal Palace, having become one of the most expensive players of all time. Shakhtar had held out for a number of weeks over their valuation of Mudryk despite Arsenal's best efforts to lower his price, and were eventually rewarded when Todd Boehly opened his war chest of Chelsea money to agree a deal that could be worth  £87m if all add-ons and bonus payments are triggered. The deal represents a huge windfall for Shakhtar, but Akhmetov confirmed in a statement that  £20m of the fee will go towards providing Ukraine's soldiers with medical supplies and treatment for the ongoing conflict with Russia.
