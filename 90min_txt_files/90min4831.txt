Manchester United have cut short starlet Tahith Chong's season-long loan move to German outfit Werder Bremen, so the winger can spend the rest of the campaign at Club Brugge in Belgium.  The Dutch youngster has not enjoyed a particularly successful spell in the Bundesliga, making only 13 league appearances and completing a full 90 minutes on only one occasion.  He was an unused substitute in Werder Bremen's 1-1 draw with Schalke on Saturday - as he was in their previous three outings - so the Red Devils have decided to pull the plug on the deal.  Man Utd confirmed that they have terminated Chong's loan with the German side, and have immediately negotiated a move to Club Brugge, which was announced on Saturday evening.

It's been a pleasure to represent this club [Werder] for the last few months," he wrote.  "Even though it wasn't long, I learnt a lot and I leave the club with some great memories and friendships. Good luck for the rest of the season.    Both the player and his parent club will be hoping to see some major progress over the next few months, after he signed a new contract in March 2020 to tie his future to Old Trafford.
