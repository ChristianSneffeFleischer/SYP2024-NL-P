Franck Kessie's agent has hit out at journalist Gerard Romero for 'unfounded news' regarding the midfielder's Barcelona future.  Kessie signed for La Blaugrana last summer following the expiration of his contract at Serie A club AC Milan, but he struggled for gametime in his first season at Camp Nou.  The Ivorian was restricted to just seven La Liga starts during the 2022/23 campaign, although he was able to contribute perhaps the most memorable Barca goal of the season - a last minute winner against Real Madrid in March that all-but sealed the league title for the club.  Following a season of few minutes, Kessie has been consistently been linked with a move away from Barca this summer, particularly by journalist Gerard Romero who recently reported that Xavi Hernandez personally called the midfielder to discuss his departure from the club.  feed That report has now been emphatically rebuked by Kessie's agent who took to Instagram.  "Dear Gerard Romero, we have remarked for the umpteenth time that you have published unfounded news concerning one of our clients (Franck Kessie)," he posted. "Despite ourselves, we inform those who follow us and able all those who follow you that you have never once given exact information regarding Kessie. Ethically we find that it's a totally wrong way of doing one's job. So please stop publishing unsubstantiated and misleading information presented as news regarding our client." This is the third time that the player's agent has moved to rubbish rumours around Kessie's future. Back in March, he denied reports that his client would leave Barcelona, and then once again in early June by writing 'fake news' on a story about the Ivorian's future.
