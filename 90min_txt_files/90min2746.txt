Chelsea remain in talks with Leicester City over a deal to sign centre-back Wesley Fofana and are prepared to increase their latest offer for the Frenchman, 90min understands. Fofana is Chelsea's top defensive target but the Blues have already been knocked back with two bids, the last of which was worth close to  £70m, with Leicester long making it clear that a fee of over  £80m would be needed to convince them to do business. Sources close to the situation have confirmed to 90min that while Fofana is unhappy with his high price tag, Leicester are not prepared to budge and will continue to demand a fee similar to the  £85m that took Harry Maguire to Manchester United in 2019. Fofana has informed Leicester of his desire to join Chelsea this summer and the Blues are hopeful of making that a reality with an improved third bid. Foxes boss Brendan Rodgers has stressed publicly that he does not want to sell Fofana but, after definitively ruling out a sale, later admitted that a bid offer would have to be considered by those in charge at the King Power Stadium. Leicester are looking to make one big sale this summer to balance the books and fund their own summer spending. As it stands, back-up goalkeeper Alex Smithies is the only new face at the club.
