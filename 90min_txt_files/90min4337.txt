Leeds have lost their legal battle with RB Leipzig over the Bundesliga side's claims they went back on their agreement to sign Jean-Kevin Augustin permanently after securing promotion last year. The Frenchman moved to Elland Road on loan in January 2020, with the deal understood to have included a clause that meant Leeds were obliged to purchase Augustin for an agreed fee of as much as    21m ( Â£18m) if Marcelo Bielsa's side won promotion to the Premier League. The youngster failed to really have an impact at the club - making just three Championship appearances without scoring a goal - and the two sides subsequently agreed not to extend his stay in England after the lockdown-impacted season carried on past the loan's expiry date in June. Leeds went on to secure promotion once the season had restarted, and RB Leipzig believe the terms of their original deal meant the Whites should have purchased Augustin, though the West Yorkshire club dispute that as their promotion took place after the loan deal's expiry date they were no longer bound to its terms. A legal battle has ensued and RB Leipzig have now taken to their official Twitter account to announce FIFA have ruled in their favour. There's been no word yet on what the ramifications of the ruling will be, though it may mean that Leeds are forced to stump up the originally agreed fee.
