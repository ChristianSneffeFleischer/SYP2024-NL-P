Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund have reached an agreement for the transfer of Jude Bellingham, who is now undergoing a medical in the Spanish capital. 90min confirmed last month the deal between the two sides was close and an agreement is now in place. Real have agreed to pay an initial    100m plus adds-ons which could amount to 30% of that fee - sources have told 90min that Dortmund are 'very happy' with the agreement reached between the two parties which will make Bellingham the fourth most expensive player of all time. Bellingham is already in Madrid to undergo medical tests, allowing the England star to continue rehab on a knee issue which hampered the end to his season with Dortmund. The injury looks set to rule him out of the Three Lions' forthcoming Euro 2024 qualifiers against Malta and North Macedonia despite being included in Gareth Southgate's squad. manual The agreement between Real and Dortmund comes after contract terms were finalised with Bellingham at the beginning of May. The transfer is also welcome news for Bellingham's former club Birmingham, who are due around 5% of the deal.
