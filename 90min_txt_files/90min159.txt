Manchester United goalkeeper Nathan Bishop has joined Sunderland on a permanent transfer, ending his three and a half year spell at Old Trafford. Bishop was 20 years of age when he joined United from Southend United in January 2020, having already played 31 times in League One over several seasons with the Shrimpers. The goalkeeper linked up with United   s Under-23 squad, before then playing a full season on loan at Mansfield in League Two in 2021/22. He leaves without making a competitive first-team appearance. The 23-year-old now joins a Sunderland side targeting a return to the Premier League after reaching the Championship playoffs last season. The likelihood is he will provide competition and cover for established Black Cats number one Anthony Patterson. "You see the direction that the club is going, playing young players and allowing them to express themselves and push on in a great league," Bishop said of Sunderland. "I think that is so exciting, so I want to come in and earn the right to play for such a great team and a great club." feed Bishop most recently hit the headlines during United   s pre-season tour, featuring in the friendly against Wrexham in San Diego. He was involved in an unfortunate collision with Paul Mullin that left the Wrexham striker with a punctured lung. There was backlash from opposing fans, while Wrexham manager Phil Parkinson also slated Bishop for his involvement in the incident. But the goalkeeper apologised to Mullin and was also personally contacted by Wrexham co-owner Ryan Reynolds to thank him for how he handled things. Manchester United are left with Andre Onana, Tom Heaton and Dean Henderson are their first-team goalkeepers, although the latter   s future remains uncertain. Czech pair Matej Kovar and Radek Vitek have also played a part with the senior squad during pre-season.
