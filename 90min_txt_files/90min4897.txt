Manchester United are said to be interested in Real Sociedad defender Robin Le Normand, though they are unlikely to make a move for him until the summer due to his high release clause.  Le Normand has performed well this season, helping La Real record one of the best defensive records in La Liga. Imanol Alguacil's side are currently fifth in the table, with the summer addition of David Silva proving a masterstroke so far.  According to the Daily Mail (via Grada3), Le Normand's fine start to the season hasn't gone unnoticed, with United monitoring him closely. It has long been reported that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is not entirely happy with his defensive options and a host of centre-backs have been linked with the club over the past 12 months.  Le Normand is the latest named to be mentioned but the Red Devils would need to spend big in order to secure his services. He currently has a hefty    75m ( £66.3m) release clause, after signing a new contract in the summer, and La Real are unlikely to let him depart for anything less.  The Basque club have shown themselves to be no pushovers in the transfer market in the past, selling Diego Llorente for a whopping  £18m to Leeds United in September. Alvaro Odriozola was also sold for  £27m a few years back, and they have managed to keep hold of Mikel Oyarzabal despite strong interest from Manchester City.
