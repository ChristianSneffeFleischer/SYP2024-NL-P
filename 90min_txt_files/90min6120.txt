Newcastle are eager to improve their attacking options for next season and are interested in signing Bournemouth duo Josh King and David Brooks this summer. The Magpies' potential  £300m Saudi-backed takeover fell through last week, leaving Mike Ashley at the helm, although the Cherries' relegation to the Championship means the aforementioned pair are set to be available on the cheap. The Daily Telegraph report that it may take a fee in the region of  £30m to prize the dynamic striker away from the south coast, with Steve Bruce's transfer budget for the current window believed to be around that mark. Bruce is keen on bolstering his attacking options this summer despite splurging  £40m on club-record signing Joelinton a year ago. The Brazilian failed to find his feet in his debut campaign and, despite the innovative efforts of Allan Saint-Maximin, the Magpies averaged a mere goal a game in the Premier League last time out - though Bruce's switch to a 4-2-3-1 after the restart helped the side reap more rewards. There's no doubting the Tynesiders are in desperate need of alternate creative and striking options ahead of the 2020/21 season, and Bruce has identified the Bournemouth duo as his two prime targets. King enjoyed two double-digit scoring campaigns for the Cherries in the Premier League and emerged as a January target for Manchester United. However, he struggled for form last time out and was only able to muster six goals, two of which came after the restart.
