New Manchester United signing Casemiro has admitted he is looking forward to playing alongside Cristiano Ronaldo again this season. The pair enjoyed significant success together at Real Madrid and have now reunited at Old Trafford, although their link-up could be short-lived as Ronaldo has asked to leave the club this summer in search of Champions League football. The list of suitors for Ronaldo is not a long one, however, and as it stands, the 37-year-old appears likely to remain at United for at least another season. That would be good news to Casemiro, who opened up on his relationship with Ronaldo in a recent interview with ESPN. "Cris...we're talking about a player who, in my opinion, is one of the best of all time," Casemiro said. "The illusion of being able to play with him again...he knows the respect I have for him. "I hope he stays, because he is a player who gives you leadership, gives you a lot of goals, is a winner and is very important to us.
