Man Utd are close to signing Marcel Sabitzer from Bayern Munich on a loan deal until the end of the season, 90min has learned. United have moved for Sabitzer on transfer deadline day following the news that Christian Eriksen will be out until late April or early May with an ankle injury sustained in the FA Cup win over Reading on Saturday. The Dane's injury leaves United light in the midfield department, with Donny van de Beek also out for the remainder of the season with an injury of his own. Sabitzer, 28, boarded a flight to Manchester from Munich on Tuesday evening after an agreement of a straight loan deal was largely fleshed out between the two clubs, and the player has also agreed personal terms. 90min reported earlier in the day that Sabitzer was "very excited" about the potential move to Old Trafford. The club were not planning to move for a new player prior to the deadline, though the severity of Eriksen's injury has convinced Erik ten Hag to push for United to act, as they chase a place in the Premier League's top four and attempt to win their first trophy since 2017. They are currently competing on four fronts.
