Barcelona have confirmed defender Samuel Umtiti has joined Italian side Lecce on loan for the 2022/23 season. Once one of the best centre backs in the world and still only 28 years of age, the Frenchman started confidently at Camp Nou following his move from Lyon in 2016 and was soon an important member of a Barca side that would win two La Liga titles. However, the World Cup winner consistently struggled with injuries, with a knee problem being particularly damaging, and he has since been usurped in central defence by the likes of Ronald Araujo, Eric Garcia, Andreas Christensen and Jules Kounde. Barcelona have confirmed there is no permanent buy option in Umtiti's loan move to Serie A minnows Lecce, who will pay a small part of his reported    20m per year gross salary. Barca will also receive a bonus each time he plays. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey,  Toby Cudworth  and  Harry Symeou  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Antony attempting to push through a move to Man Utd, Frenkie de Jong and Pierre-Emerick Aubayemang's futures at Barcelona and Arsenal's interest in Pedro Neto.
