Despite weeks of speculation linking him with a move to both Manchester United, Chelsea and Everton, Moises Caicedo now appears to be on the verge of joining Brighton. Speculation surrounding United's interest in the Independiente del Valle starlet has circled for a number of weeks, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer seemingly keen to bolster his midfield options. The Red Devils looked set to lodge a  Â£4.5m bid for the 19-year-old, however, with a concrete bid yet to be placed, Everton recently emerged as shock favourites to seal a deal. Well, that's all changed. Metro report that Brighton are now in pole position to land Caicedo, with an agreement already reached between the two sides. As of yet, there's no indication as to whether personal terms have been agreed between the player and the Seagulls - and given Caicedo's allegiance towards United, he'll no doubt be keen to hold out and see if Solskjaer does intend to table a bid - however, the two clubs certainly seem to have come to an agreement on the youngster's future. Caicedo hasn't been short of Premier League admirers over recent months, with Newcastle also said to have been keeping tabs on the teenager, while interest hasn't just been limited to these shores, with both Milan and RB Leipzig also monitoring his progress. Should Graham Potter secure the Ecuador international's signature it will reflect something of a coup for the club considering the interest he has attracted from across Europe. Brighton's sudden interest in the dynamic midfielder could be the latest indication that Yves Bissouma's time at the Amex is set to come to an end.
