Bayern Munich CEO Oliver Kahn has warned Benjamin Pavard that public pressure about a future transfer will not work against the Bundesliga side. Pavard, whose contract expires in 2024, has yet to agree an extension to his current deal and has publicly admitted on more than one occasion that he would be prepared to listen to offers from elsewhere, with Serie A side AC Milan even namedropped as a possible landing spot. However, Kahn has now warned Pavard that speaking publicly about his future is no way to resolve his situation. "Nobody can start their departure with statements, especially not in public," Kahn told Sky Germany. "We won't allow that. "Benjamin knows what he has in Bayern. We also know what we have in him. We can classify and manage the emotions of the players, which sometimes go up and down."

He recently confessed that he will only consider offers as a central defender, despite the vast majority of his Bayern career being spent as a right-back.
