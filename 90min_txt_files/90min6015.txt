Exclusive - Manchester United's plan to send Dean Henderson out on loan next season remains unchanged, a decision that the player is in favour of.  The 23-year-old spent the last two years with Sheffield United where he carved out a reputation as one of the most talented goalkeepers in England. During the 2019/2020 season, Henderson registered 13 clean sheets, enough to see him nominated for Premier League Young Player of the Year. Back in March, it was reported that United planned to recognise this impressive form by offering the England Under-21 international a lucrative new contract, before loaning him back out during the 2020/2021 season.  90min has now been told that this remains the plan and David de Gea's place as United number one remaining safe for another season. Although Henderson will once again be sent out on loan, it is unlikely he will return to Bramall Lane.  Chris Wilder is close to tying up an  Â£18.5m deal for Bournemouth goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale which seems to confirm they are out of the race. No less than a dozen clubs have registered their interest in taking Henderson on loan. Chelsea, meanwhile, are among a number of sides who want to sign the keeper permanently, although United will not sell as they view him as a key part of their future.
