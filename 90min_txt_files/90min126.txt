West Ham United are locked in talks with Ajax over a deal for Mexican midfielder Edson Alvarez, 90min understands. Alvarez has emerged as one of West Ham's top targets this summer, and is the choice of recently appointed technical director Tim Steidten. Steidten and manager David Moyes have been struggling to agree on targets throughout the summer. That has now seen West Ham switch focus to Alvarez after failing to seal deals for Southampton's James Ward-Prowse and Manchester United's Scott McTominay. West Ham, despite the record sale of Declan Rice, have yet to make a breakthrough in the transfer market and that plight was highlighted at the weekend as they were hammered 4-0 by Bayer Leverkusen - ironically Steidten's former club. He has now pushed ahead with a move for Alvarez in an attempt to get something done before the start of the Premier League season next weekend. feed Now, West Ham have made an initial offer  £25.9m for Alvarez. Although that isn't considered enough by Ajax, who are seeking just over  £30m, talks have continued and are at an advanced stage. Alvarez was a target for Chelsea last year and almost joined Borussia Dortmund earlier this summer, before that deal fell through to give West Ham the opportunity to try and land him. 90min understands the Hammers are looking to bring in up to six players before the summer window closes and getting the Alvarez deal over the line is seen as a key breakthrough in the transfer market.
