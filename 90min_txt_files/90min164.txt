Barcelona are ready to make a fresh bid for Manchester City full-back Joao Cancelo, sources have confirmed to 90min. Barca showed an interest in the Portugal international during the January transfer window, but were unable to get a deal over the line and he eventually joined Bayern Munich on loan for the rest of the 2022/23 season. Bayern chose not make the move permanent and Cancelo has since returned to City. The German champions have instead turned to Cancelo's City team-mate Kyle Walker and they are still hoping to sign him. Cancelo has little desire to remain at City and the feeling at the club is mutual. Pep Guardiola has not changed his stance in wanting him moved on from the club. Arsenal have shown an interest in Cancelo and they remain keen on the full-back, but it is Barcelona who are now stepping up their efforts. feed Barcelona's finances are still far from secure and any deal will need to be sanctioned by La Liga. However, the likely sale of Ousmane Dembele to PSG means that they will have room to manoeuvre and a new right-back is seen as one of their priorities. Speaking after their pre-season win against AC Milan, head coach Xavi said: "The right-back is a position that we should look at again, and reinforce. We have players who adapt but they are not in their natural positions. We will see how everything turns out and how we also fit into financial fair play." Real Vallodolid's Ivan Fresneda is an option they are also considering, but Cancelo is believed to be their main priority and they are ready to push ahead with a move. Barcelona would ideally like a loan with an option to buy for Cancelo, who still has four years left on his current deal at City. 90min understands that Cancelo's camp have already spoken with Barcelona and personal terms will not be an issue.
