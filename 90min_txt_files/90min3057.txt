Barcelona and Bayern Munich are close to finalising a deal for Robert Lewandowski, 90min understands. The two clubs have been locked in talks for weeks, but Bar  a are now in a position to agree terms with the German champions. Lewandowski's agent Pini Zahavi has been working hard to get the two clubs to strike a deal, having already reached a broad agreement with Bar  a over what is believed to be a three-year contract. 90min understands that Zahavi had been keeping the likes of Chelsea and Manchester United updated on Lewandowski's situation should the move to Catalonia fall through, but 90min understands both clubs have been told that he is indeed heading to Camp Nou. Barcelona completed the re-signing of Ousmane Dembele and finalised the move of Raphinha from Leeds this week, and sources in Spain have confirmed to 90min that a deal for the Polish superstar is expected to be finalised over the weekend. Bar  a president Joan Laporta, who earlier this month praised Lewandowski for trying to force his way to Camp Nou, refused to comment on Friday at the unveiling of Raphinha. "I   ve nothing to say on Lewandowski deal. I   m not gonna comment this negotiation, we have to respect FC Bayern," said Laporta. "I really respect Bayern and Lewa is their player." It is expected that Barcelona will pay a fee in the region of    50m plus add-ons for Lewandowski.
