PSG have confirmed the signing of Lieke Martens from Barcelona following the conclusion of her contract with the Catalan club. Martens has signed a three-year deal with PSG, keeping her in Paris until 2025. The Netherlands winger - regarded as one of the finest players in world football - announced her departure from Barcelona on Thursday, bringing an end to her five-year stay with the Spanish champions. During her time with Barcelona, the club blossomed into a women's football powerhouse. Martens won three league titles, three Copas de la Reina trophies, and was a pivotal part of the side that won a maiden Champions League title during the 2020/21 season. "Paris Saint-Germain is proud to announce the signing of Lieke Martens for the next three seasons," a statement on PSG's official website reads. "The club welcomes Lieke to the Rouge et Bleu family." The 29-year-old joined Barcelona from Rosengard in 2017, and went on to score 73 goals in 156 appearances for the club. During her time in Spain she also scooped the 2017 Best FIFA Women's Player award, having been instrumental in the Netherlands Euro 2017 triumph on home soil. "After five beautiful years at this fantastic club in this beautiful city I have decided to part ways with the club and start a new adventure," Martens wrote on Instagram when confirming her Barcelona departure.
