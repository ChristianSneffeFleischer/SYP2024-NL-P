Tottenham have rejected AC Milan's opening bid for erratic defender Serge Aurier. Spurs are currently in the market for a new right-back with a  £15m move for Wolves' Matt Doherty edging closer.  Although this may open the door for Aurier's departure, Tottenham were not tempted by Milan's opening offer for the 27-year-old.  According to Sky Sports the Rossoneri's first bid was swiftly rejected with the clubs remaining some way apart in their valuations of the Ivory Coast international. Bayer Leverkusen are also believed to be eyeing up a move for Aurier, who is contracted until 2022. Aurier signed for the Lilywhites for  £23m from Paris Saint-Germain back in August 2017, and has gone on to make 83 appearances for the club in all competitions. Towards the beginning of last season he found himself out of favour with Mauricio Pochettino omitting him for the starting XI.  Since the Argentine was replaced by Jos   Mourinho, he has enjoyed an extended run in the first team. However, Spurs could still be willing to part for him for the right price, particularly if they are able to seal a deal for Doherty before the start of the season. Although Milan have so far had no luck prising Aurier away from north London, Stefano Pioli is set to be boosted by the re-signing of Zlatan Ibrahimovic. The legendary Swede rejoined his former club on a short term deal in December.
