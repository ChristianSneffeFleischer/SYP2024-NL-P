Barcelona winger Raphinha has confirmed he has no desire to leave Camp Nou this summer, vowing to stay at the club for 'many more years'. The Brazil international bagged ten goals and 12 assists in a solid debut year at Barcelona and has been identified by both Arsenal and Newcastle as a possible summer transfer target. While Barcelona want to keep Raphinha around, their need to raise money and trim their wage bill has led to reports that the 26-year-old could be sold for the right price, but that is something the winger himself is clearly not interested in. "I will stay at Bar  a next season and the season after next, and the season after that, I have many years on my contract and I hope to serve those years and many more," he told Club Del Deportista. He added: "Barcelona is a city I love, we Brazilians are very happy here." feed Raphinha came under criticism for a slot start to life in Catalonia. He managed just one goal and one assist in his first ten outings in La Liga but soon developed into one of Xavi's most dependable players, and Raphinha was keen to praise the manager for his continued faith. "My first six months were difficult. It was a start to the season in which I scored few goals, made few assists, and didn   t play a direct role in the team," he explained. "But then I started to adapt better, my teammates helped me a lot. "We have a coach who knows perfectly the way Barcelona play, someone who knows the club inside out. Xavi knew what he could do with this group."
