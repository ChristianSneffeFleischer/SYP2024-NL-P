Barcelona are showing interest in Atalanta star Robin Gosens as they target a new left-back to provide competition for, and perhaps ultimately replace, long-serving Jordi Alba. The squad at Camp Nou is in desperate need of fresh blood after another poor season by the club   s extremely high standards, and the left side of the defence is an area that has been identified. Local publication SPORT writes that Bar  a are looking at Gosens, who has impressed with Atalanta again in 2020/21 and has been named in Germany   s squad for Euro 2020. The 26-year-old has thrived as an attacking wing-back with the Serie A side. He joined them in 2017, having previously been based in Netherlands since he was a teenager, but has really come into his own since 2019 and has scored 22 goals in the last two seasons alone. Gosens can also play in a more conventional back four and his versatility would give Bar  a coach Ronald Koeman plenty of options in what will be a crucial 2021/22 season. Bar  a famously have financial difficulties, although a number of other expected signings     Sergio Aguero, Memphis Depay and Eric Garcia     would arrive as free agents without a transfer fee. Gosens is said to be valued at    40m by Atalanta, who may be open to player exchanges. He will also soon enter the final year of his contract, which means the right time to sell could be now. But Bar  a are not the only club that have taken an interest in Gosens. Juventus, AC Milan and Inter are all described as having    made contact   , while there could also be competition from Manchester City. Left-back remains a problem position for the Premier League. It is said that Bar  a are looking to sell current understudy left-back Junior Firpo, which will both create space in the squad and raise funds. Alba may also be asked to take a pay cut.
