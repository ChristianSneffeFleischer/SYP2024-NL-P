Fulham's hopes of signing Arsenal right-back Cedric and Everton midfielder Abdoulaye Doucoure have been dealt a blow with both deals stalling, 90min understands. The Whites had been hopeful of completing the double swoop early in the January transfer window, but have work to do in order to finalise both signings. The west London side had agreed a fee with Arsenal over Cedric, but the Gunners are refusing to pay for half of his wage packet as Fulham had hoped. Both teams want to finalise a deal, however, and are working on solutions. Fulham were also unaware that Doucoure is currently earning over  Â£100,000-a-week at Everton. They are offering to cover less than half of that total and there is some distance with the Toffees regarding this issue. Doucoure is also wanted by former club Watford, who could make a loan offer with an obligatory purchase clause should they be promoted back to the Premier League.
