Malo Gusto is pushing for Lyon to sanction a January move to big-spending Chelsea, 90min understands. The 19-year-old is one a number of high-profile transfer targets for Graham Potter's Blues, who have already been backed heavily in the winter market by chairman Todd Boehly. Chelsea have substantially forked out on the likes of Benoit Badiashile, David Datro Fofana, Andrey Santos, Mykhailo Mudryk and Noni Madueke this month, but still appear determined to add more fresh faces to their squad. A central midfielder remains a priority for Chelsea, but 90min understands that the club are hopeful of completing a deal for teenage full-back Gusto. Chelsea's interest in Gusto was first revealed by 90min back in October, when he was also scouted by Arsenal, Barcelona, Manchester City and Manchester United, and there's a growing confidence that a deal for the teenager will be done. Listen now as  Scott Saunders  hosts  Graeme Bailey  and  Toby Cudworth  to discuss the latest transfer news. On today's agenda: Dusan Vlahovic, Anthony Gordon, Enzo Fernandes, Amadou Onana, Malo Gusto, Nicolo Zaniolo, Pedro Porro, Weston McKennie, Milan Skriniar, Maiximo Perrone & more!

Gusto himself is pushing for Lyon to agree a fee with Chelsea, with the Ligue 1 giants looking to extract as much value as they can get from a player who has less than 18 months on his contract. Lyon's preference is to keep Gusto until the end of the season - president Jean-Michel Aulas has even stated as much on his Twitter account - but sources have told 90min that the player would prefer to move to west London in January rather than wait for the summer.
