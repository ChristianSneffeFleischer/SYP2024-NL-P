Lionel Messi is unwilling to discuss a new contract with Paris Saint-Germain until after the World Cup later this year, with the French club keen to extend the legendary forward's deal by another year. Arsenal have reached an agreement to sign utility man Oleksandr Zinchenko from Premier League rivals Manchester City for  £30m. Negotiations are ongoing on personal terms. City have no intention of selling Bernardo Silva to Barcelona this summer amid reports that they have set a price tag of less than  £70m. One player who will be joining the Blaugrana is striker Robert Lewandowski, with the Pole finally on the verge of signing from Bayern Munich having travelled to Catalonia for a medical, and an agreement in principle has been confirmed. Die Roten are preparing a bid worth in excess of    30m for Rennes' Mathys Tel, who would help to replace the prolific Lewandowski. However, Bayern have once again distanced themselves from a possible move for Manchester United superstar Cristiano Ronaldo, who wants to leave Old Trafford this summer. United manager Erik ten Hag is prepared to play the long game to land Barca midfielder Frenkie de Jong this summer, telling the hierarchy to get the deal done.

Real Madrid are close to selling Japanese forward Takefusa Kubo to Real Sociedad, although they will keep 50% of his rights.
