Barcelona are still open to selling midfielder Miralem Pjanic this summer, while French defender Samuel Umtiti is negotiating a pay cut to remain at the club. Both were linked with an exit throughout the transfer window as La Blaugrana looked to drastically reduce their wage bill - a large factor in the club's staggering financial turmoil and inability to register Lionel Messi before his departure. Although the transfer window has shut in the majority of European countries, Bar  a are still looking to move 31-year-old Pjanic on. His agent is speaking to sides in Turkey and Russia, where clubs can still negotiate deals until 7 and 8 September respectively, according to RAC1, . The Bosnia and Herzegovina midfielder arrived at Camp Nou from Juventus in a deal worth around    60m last summer, with Arthur Melo moving in the opposite direction. However, he has never been in favour under Ronald Koeman, playing just 619 minutes of La Liga action last term.  Pjanic has been one of the high-earning contingent of the squad thought to be on the way out earlier in the summer, and it still looks like a possibility. Meanwhile, another of that group in Umtiti is likely to remain at the club. The 27-year-old has struggled with injuries since his arrival from Lyon in 2016 and has failed to register more than 14 La Liga appearances in any of the past three campaigns.
