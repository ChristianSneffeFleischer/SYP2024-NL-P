West Ham United manager David Moyes has provided an update on the club's pursuit of Manchester United defender Harry Maguire. 90min reported on Wednesday that the two clubs had agreed terms on a  Â£30m transfer fee after the Hammers agreed to up their wage offer. Ahead of West Ham's Premier League season opener away to Bournemouth, Moyes was asked for the latest on the saga. "We've had a bid accepted from Manchester United, but while he's not our player I'm not in a position to discuss him," he replied. feed While Maguire has not officially left the club yet, 90min understands Man Utd are stepping up plans to bring in a replacement centre-back. Bayern Munich's Benjamin Pavard has been offered to the Red Devils and has made it clear in recent months that he wants to continue his playing career at centre-back as opposed to right-back. Nice's Jean-Clair Todibo, Everton's Jarrad Branthwaite, Torino's Perr Schuurs and Bayer Leverkusen's Edmond Tapsoba are all on Man Utd's shortlist. Maguire was stripped of the club captaincy this summer and removed entirely from Man Utd's leadership group, with Bruno Fernandes being promoted to skipper. West Ham, meanwhile, have finally made some movement in the transfer market after a quiet summer window. They recently completed the signing of Ajax midfielder Edson Alvarez, with Southampton captain James Ward-Prowse set to follow.
