West Ham United have spoken to Sevilla about a deal for long-term target Youssef En-Nesyri, 90min can confirm, and have held talks over the signing of Lorient forward Terem Moffi. The Hammers are struggling at the wrong end of the Premier League table after losing 11 of the 18 games they've played so far this season, winning just four and drawing three. David Moyes' side have scored only 15 goals in that time - the joint-fourth worst record in the division - despite forking out big money in the summer on the likes of Gianluca Scamacca and Lucas Paqueta, and that lack of return has placed huge pressure on the shoulders of the former Everton and Manchester United manager. 90min has long understood that West Ham are in the market for another forward to provide competition for Scamacca and Michail Antonio, and sources have confirmed that contact has again been made with struggling Sevilla over En-Nesyri. Listen now as  Scott Saunders  hosts  Graeme Bailey  and  Toby Cudworth  in the latest episode of Talking Transfers. This week they discuss Man Utd   s interest in Mohammed Kudus, Enzo Fernandez and Chelsea, Jude Bellingham's decision and Mykhaylo Mudryk's preferred move. Available on  all audio platforms.

The 25-year-old first appeared on West Ham's radar in the 2021 January transfer window and an interest has been maintained since, even though the Moroccan World Cup star - who played all seven games in Qatar and scored two goals en route to a surprise semi-final appearance - endured a disappointing 2021/22 season. Talks have been held about a potential loan deal but it's unclear at this stage whether En-Nesyri would be interested in moving to London Stadium.
