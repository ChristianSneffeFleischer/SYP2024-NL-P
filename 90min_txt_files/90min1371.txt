Anthony Elanga has confessed to feeling frustrated towards his reduced role at Manchester United this season. The 20-year-old winger was a regular starter towards the end of last season but has tumbled down the pecking order under Erik ten Hag, starting just five Premier League games and struggling for minutes in cup competitions as well. There were plenty of rumours suggesting Elanga could leave United in January, with the likes of Barcelona and Borussia Dortmund both touted as suitors, but a move ultimately failed to materialise and the Sweden international has remained on United's bench. "It is frustrating," Elanga told Afton Bladet. "You want to play. It is important. But if you don't play, it's not up to me but up to the coach. "I have spoken to Erik and it is private between the two of us. I know what he wants me to do and I can just keep training hard. When the opportunity comes, I just have to be ready to take it.

Elanga also confessed that talks were held over a move away from Old Trafford in January. "There was talk about it, but right now I'm focusing on United," he stressed. "We still have a big season ahead of us and need to finish it as well as possible.  "That was in January, now I can't focus on it. The best I can do is focus on the rest of the season, then I get to talk to the club. I love the club, but it's important for me to play. I'm still young. We have spoken to the club and they know what is required and I know what is required." LISTEN NOW
