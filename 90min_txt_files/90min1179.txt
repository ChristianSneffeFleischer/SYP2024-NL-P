Borussia Dortmund sporting director Sebastian Kehl has been quizzed on reports that Real Madrid are nearing the signing of Jude Bellingham. 90min reported on Wednesday that following a key meeting between Bellingham's father and Real Madrid chief scout Juni Calafat earlier this week, the midfielder is closing in on a move to the Santiago Bernabeu. Liverpool pulled out of the race to sign Bellingham in April as their squad-wide rebuild takes shape, leaving Los Blancos and Manchester City as the main contenders for his signature. Dortmund also held out hope he would sign a new contract but with a fair release clause to kick in for the summer 2024 window. 90min has long stated that while Dortmund will cooperate with Bellingham to help him seal the transfer of his choosing, they will stand firm and demand a club-record fee - this currently stands at    144m, which was paid by Barcelona for winger Ousmane Dembele in 2017. Sources have now told 90min that although the footballing world now expects Bellingham to head to Spain, Dortmund have not yet heard from the 19-year-old or Real Madrid to confirm his plans. feed Sporting director Kehl was asked by Sky Sports Germany of Real Madrid's advancing interest, but was dismissive with his answer. "We want to become champions here in Bundesliga, it's out total priority. We're subordinating everything else to that right now," he said. Dortmund moved top of the Bundesliga just under a fortnight ago but conceded first place back to Bayern Munich after a controversial 1-1 draw at Bochum in which they were denied a stonewall penalty in stoppage time - the DFB Referee Committee admitted not awarding the spot kick was an error.
