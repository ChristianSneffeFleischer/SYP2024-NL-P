Leicester City midfielder Adrien Silva is attracting interest from Sampdoria, with the Serie A outfit in touch with his representatives regarding a move.  Silva joined Monaco on loan back in January of 2019, before once again re-joining the Ligue 1 outfit for the 2019/20 season. The midfielder made 25 appearances in all competitions last term, grabbing two assists. There was growing belief Monaco would make the move permanent, but they opted against this.  While Silva is now back with Leicester, he is expected to leave the King Power Stadium this summer as he isn't part of Brendan Rodgers' plans. Former club Sporting were previously linked with a move for the 31-year-old, but Gianluca Di Marzio now reports that it's Sampdoria who are attempting to secure his services.  The report claims that the side, managed by Claudio Ranieri, are in touch with his representatives to try and bring him to the club. At this moment in time, there is no agreement in place, but Sampdoria are working to try to reach one.  Silva has struggled to really make much of an impression at all at Leicester since officially joining the club in January 2018. The Portuguese agreed to sign for the Foxes the summer prior, but he wasn't officially registered until after the deadline had passed.  In total, he made just 21 appearances in total for the Premier League club before departing for Monaco. Now in the final year of his contract, the club will likely allow him to leave for considerably less than the  Â£24m they paid for his services.
