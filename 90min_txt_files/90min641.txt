Arsenal fans rejoice! Declan Rice is getting closer to north London. The West Ham skipper has been a major summer target for several months and only the structure of a proposed British record deal following a  Â£105m bid from the Gunners needs ironing out. Manchester City's withdrawal from the race was also a crucial domino to fall. It's a potentially transformative addition that'll undoubtedly raise expectations, and here's what shirt numbers Rice could wear for Arsenal once he joins the club. feed Declan Rice has exclusively worn the 41 shirt since he broke into the West Ham first-team. The digits have become so iconic for the Hammers in recent seasons that emerging youngster Keira Flannery wears the same shirt for the women's team because of him. Explaining why he's continued to stick with this number throughout his Hammers career, Rice told Gary Neville on The Overlap: "When you're in the U23s, you've obviously got the first-team squad numbers and then it starts to get to the higher numbers when you're in the U23s. "I was given 41, I remember when I went to Seattle on my first trip with the first team, I just got given 41 and you know what, it's stayed with me since." For England, though, he's primarily worn the 4 shirt. Although, he's also donned 7, 16, 5, 17, 18, and 16 - the rules regarding shirt numbers at the international level are much more strict, especially at major tournaments.  While it is an unconventional number, Rice could stick with 41 at Arsenal. During that same interview with Neville, the 24-year-old said: "To be honest with you, I've been having this conversation with my Dad, regardless of what happens in my career, I think I might stay with the 41." The number was taken by Mauro Bandeira, an academy graduate, last season. Rice shouldn't have any trouble convincing the youngster to give it up.
