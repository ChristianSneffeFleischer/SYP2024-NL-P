Bayern Munich sporting director Hasan Salihamidzic has denied that Manchester United made a bid for winger Kingsley Coman in the summer.  It was reported back in July that the Red Devils had held talks with Die Roten regarding the Champions League final hero as a move for priority target Jadon Sancho was proving tricky. Reports even suggested that the Frenchman was keen on a move to Old Trafford to link-up with compatriots Paul Pogba and Anthony Martial. Leroy Sane's switch to Bavaria, meanwhile, also cast doubt in the mind of Coman over his role in Hansi Flick's side and the number of opportunities that he'll be granted. Nevertheless, Bayern chief Salihamidzic has said that the 24-year-old was never going to leave Munich even if United had approached the German giants.    "There was nothing, and we wouldn't have looked into it either," he told German outlet Bild.  "His goal in the Champions League final should explain enough why we are relying on him wholeheartedly."   Speculation regarding Coman's future arose following comments made by the 24-year-old about the possibility of playing with Pogba. "If I could choose a player, I would like to have [Paul] Pogba for Bayern," he said in July. "This would be fantastic. He has unbelievable abilities and is a fantastic midfielder. "Apart from this he is not only important on the pitch. He has huge marketing value. He stays in people's minds."
