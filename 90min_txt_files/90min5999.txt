Luis Suarez has revealed that he wishes to remain at Barcelona, amid rumours linking the striker with a move away from the club. Barca are currently in crisis with their humiliating 8-2 Champions League exit at the hands of Bayern Munich this month representing the culmination of years of mismanagement. In the wake of that defeat, Blaugrana president Josep Maria Bartomeu sensationally confirmed he would be open to selling almost all of the current playing squad, including Suarez.  In an interview with Spanish newspaper El Pa  s (via Ol  ), the Uruguayan hit back at these comments, insisting that Bartomeu would need to speak with him directly if he wanted him to leave. "There is talk of some names that the president gave, of changes that can be made, but no one told me that they want to do without me; if this is the desire of the club, it would be good if the person in charge that he chooses speaks directly to me," he said. "I have been in the club for six years. Enough time to say what they think. Better so filter if I am one of those who want me to leave. It remains to be seen. "I also want the best for the club and my idea today is to continue, but if from the club they think that I am expendable, I have no problem speaking with those who decide."
