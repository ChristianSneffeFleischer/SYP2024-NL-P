Ansu Fati insists he wants to stay at Barcelona despite interest from a number of Premier League clubs this summer.  The 20-year-old has long been considered one of the most talented young players in world football, but has struggled with a number of serious injury concerns throughout his short career to date. Fati has missed 88 games due injury issues, one of which kept him out of action for close to a full year back in 2020.  Although largely back to full fitness in recent times, the youngster was little more than a peripheral figure for Xavi Hernandez's La Liga title-winning team during 2022/23 season - being limited to 12 starts in the league and just two in Europe.  90min reported back at the start of May that this lack of game time led to Barcelona informing the player that he would be allowed to leave the club during the summer transfer window. Wolves and West Ham United were the two clubs with an interest in the player's services, with Jorge Mendes trying to engineer a move to the former, however sources confirmed at the time that Fati was not keen on joining lower-Premier League teams.  feed Now the player has given an update on his future, stating that he fully intends to stay at La Blaugrana this summer. "I have a contract with Barcelona and my intention is to continue to improve and grow here. That is my intention. I have a contract and I   m happy. Both at my club and with the national team", Fati told Mundo Deportivo.  Fati came off of the bench for Spain as the beat Croatia in the Nations League final on Sunday evening via a penalty shootout.
