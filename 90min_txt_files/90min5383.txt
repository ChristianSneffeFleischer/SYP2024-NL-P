Now, the St. James' Park outfit have confirmed the news. Saint Maximin told the club's website "I've played for a lot of clubs - Monaco, Nice, in Germany, but Newcastle, I feel like it's my home. The supporters give me a lot of love, the coach too, and my partners on the pitch. "Everybody gives me love and when you have this, I feel it's my home and I hope this stays my home for a long time. "Every club I'd been before, the fans loved me - but not like the Newcastle fans. That's really important, because for me, you have the football and everything, but you have the human and they give me something different. So if I can give back to the supporters and to the club with a new deal, I'm really happy." Manager Bruce added: "We're absolutely delighted that he's committed his future here. We're delighted to be keeping him - and he's delighted to be staying. "I'm sure the supporters will be delighted with the news. He's had an introduction now to what life in the Premier League is like and with Allan, the world is at his feet. He can go as far as he wants to go, because he's got the talent to do it."
