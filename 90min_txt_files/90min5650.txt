Reigning Serie A champions Juventus are poised to terminate the contract of German midfielder Sami Khedira.  The 2014 World Cup winner is in the final year of his contract with Juventus but has been blighted by injuries for much of his career, which have only worsened with age. Khedira has failed to hit double digits for league starts in either of the last two campaigns. Despite winning the Serie A title - the club's ninth consecutive Scudetto - Juventus parted ways with manager Maurizio Sarri following a surprising Champions League exit at the hands of French side Lyon. A week after being appointed as Juve's Under-23 coach, Andrea Pirlo was given the first-team position despite his non-existent managerial experience. Less than six weeks in the job, Pirlo has already decided Khedira is an expendable asset according to Goal. Initially Khedira was adamant that he would see out the final 12 months of his deal in Turin although his departure is looking ever more likely. Manchester United - tempted by his availability on a free transfer - have been linked with the 33-year-old by The Sun. Juventus may have been the dominant force in Italian football for the best part of a decade, but even they are not impervious to the economic constraints of the coronavirus pandemic. Removing Khedira's salary from their sizeable wage bill - as well as his contributions on the pitch - is also a consideration in this decision. While the club and Khedira are yet to come to a concrete agreement over the termination of the player's contract, Juve will reportedly save a sum in the region of  Â£5.5m with his departure.
