Manchester City are interested in signing Sassuolo midfielder Manuel Locatelli this summer, but face competition from both Juventus and Milan.  Locatelli has impressed for Roberto De Zerbi's side this season, missing just one game through suspension and helping them mount a surprise bid for Champions League qualification. No midfielder has registered a higher progressive passing distance in Serie A this season and he is also leading the way for combined tackles and interceptions.  According to the Daily Mail, his impressive form is attracting the interest of City, who may view him as the ideal replacement for Fernandinho, whose deal expires at the end of the season. Locatelli is under contract until 2023 and it would take in excess of  Â£30m to prise him away from Sassuolo, a club at which he has rebuilt his career. After bursting onto the scene for Milan during the 2015/2016 season, Locatelli gradually fell out of favour. Eventually he made the switch to the Neroverdi in 2018, initially on loan before joining permanently.   Milan are also said to be interested in bringing him back to San Siro, with Juventus similarly sniffing around the midfielder.  The player's agent, Stefano Castelnuovo, said: "We have a great relationship with Sassuolo, the club is really ambitious. We'll see what happens. If a nice offer comes, it would be good for everyone to find an agreement. We'll be always grateful to Sassuolo.
