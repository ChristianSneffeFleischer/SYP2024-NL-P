Borussia Dortmund prodigy Youssoufa Moukoko has remained coy on rumours of an impending transfer, telling the media they will 'find out' where his future lies. The 17-year-old, who turns 18 on the opening day of the World Cup, has been in sparkling form for Dortmund this season, subsequently earning a call-up to Hansi Flick's Germany squad. However, with his contract at the club set to expire in the summer of 2023, Moukoko could be set for pastures new with Europe's elite interested in his signature. In a recent interview, Moukoko said he was happy in his current environment at Dortmund - but did not rule out the possibility of leaving the club.    I will decide whatever happens," Moukoko said. "I feel the confidence of the coach and I feel very comfortable in Dortmund. "In the end, you will find out if I stay or not." In a press conference in Qatar, Moukoko was interrupted by Manuel Neuer, who told the striker to 'come to Bayern'.
