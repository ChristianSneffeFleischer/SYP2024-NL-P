Chelsea have launched a bid worth  £48m for Southampton's in-demand midfielder Romeo Lavia, sources have confirmed to 90min. The Blues are looking to bring in a couple of midfielders this month to bolster Mauricio Pochettino's options and Lavia has emerged as one of their prime targets. Chelsea are already in talks with Brighton & Hove Albion over Moises Caicedo and have seen a number of bids for him rejected, but 90min understands that, while those talks are continuing, they have now also made a move for Lavia. Chelsea have long been interested in Lavia, with their interest driven by their co-director of recruitment and talent Joe Shields - the man who took Lavia to Southampton in 2023. feed Southampton, who have agreed to sell their captain James Ward-Prowse to West Ham Untied for  £30m, are demanding  £50m for Belgian starlet Lavia and Chelsea's offer is short of that at  £48m, but it is the largest bid they have received so far this summer. Liverpool have been in pole position for Lavia, but they have seen three bids for the teenager rejected, with their latest offer for the 19-year-old being worth  £45m. Sources believe that Southampton are now more than confident that their  £50m asking price will be met by one of Lavia's suitors and they won't be accepting less.
