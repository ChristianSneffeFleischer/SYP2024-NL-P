Leicester City are closing in on the signing of Atalanta full-back Timothy Castagne.  The versatile defender plays mainly on the right     making him the perfect cover for the currently-sidelined Ricardo Pereira     but can also cover on the left, a spot which is up for grabs at the King Power thanks to the departure of Ben Chilwell earlier in August.  He has recently become a Belgian international after catching the eye of head coach Roberto Martinez, winning seven caps for his country. Football Insider report that there has been a breakthrough in talks recently, with the Foxes looking to get their business done before the start of the season on 12th September rather than waiting until the end of the transfer window the following month. The 24-year-old has two years left to run on his current contract but is expected to be allowed to depart Atalanta for the right price this summer, reported to be around  Â£20m, after scoring twice and providing three assists in all competitions throughout the last campaign.  Premier League rivals Tottenham Hotspur were also interested in signing the versatile defender after Castagne told  Belgian newspaper La Derniere Heure that he wouldn't be able to turn down a move to Spurs last month, revealing his interest in a move to the English top-flight. The interest may have been a stumbling block for Leicester     until Spurs signed Matt Doherty last week, filling their perceived need at right-back and cutting off the Castagne option.
