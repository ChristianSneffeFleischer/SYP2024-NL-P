Arsenal are leading the race to sign West Ham midfielder Declan Rice but are not yet prepared to meet the Hammers' asking price for their captain, 90min understands. West Ham expect to receive plenty of offers for Rice, who is also attracting interest from Chelsea, Manchester City, Manchester United and Bayern Munich, now that their Europa Conference League campaign has come to an end. Club chairman David Sullivan has confirmed the Hammers have promised to part ways with Rice this summer, with the 24-year-old ready to move on. An asking price of  £100m has been placed on Rice's head and West Ham believe the midfielder could end up commanding a higher fee if a bidding war can be sparked. 90min understands Arsenal are wary of paying so much and instead value Rice at closer to  £90m, and the Gunners would be looking to strike a deal that would see them pay an initial  £80m with add-ons to take the price higher. feed That difference in valuation has left the door open for one of Rice's many suitors to come to the negotiating table, but sources have confirmed that Arsenal remain confident that they will win the race for Rice's signature. Those in charge at the Emirates Stadium believe Arsenal is Rice's preferred destination and there is confidence that will help the Gunners fend off any competition if a transfer battle arises. Despite not yet finding a side prepared to meet their demands, West Ham have conducted serious work in anticipation of losing Rice and have drawn up a shortlist of targets to pursue if and when they end up cashing in on their captain. A late move for Ajax midfielder Edson Alvarez has been launched, while Manchester City's Kalvin Phillips and Fulham's Joao Palhinha are both admired.
