Bayern Munich are leading the race to sign Atletico Madrid's Saul Niguez with the midfielder keen to secure a move away from the La Liga leaders this summer. The Spain international has found himself slipping down the pecking order at the Wanda Metropolitano this season, with competition for places from the likes of Marcos Llorente and Thomas Lemar seeing Saul lose his status as an automatic starter in the Atleti XI. The 26-year-old has started just 14 of Diego Simeone's side's 27 La Liga outings, and with Die Roten reportedly lodging their interest in acquiring his services the midfielder has now stated his intention to leave the club at the end of the season. AS claim that Bayern's interest is the 'definitive reason' for Saul deciding to leave Atletico, though the fees speculated in the report seem some way off. The midfielder's current deal - which was signed back in 2017 - contains a release clause of  £150m, but AS claim that Atletico would be willing to accept an offer in the region of between    35-50m ( £30-43m). While Bayern's interest and his lack of playing time have been listed as Saul's main sources of frustration with the club, he's also said to be disgruntled at the lack of movement regarding a new deal in Madrid. #  LTIMAHORA?
