It's the second international break of the season, which means it's the perfect interval for players who have made a good start to the campaign to be linked with a big-money transfer in the coming windows. The subject of the latest rumour to do the rounds? RB Leipzig attacker Christopher Nkunku. In fairness, it's not surprising to see the Frenchman's name in the headlines; while Leipzig have made a poor start to 2021/22, on a personal level Nkunku has shone. The 23-year-old has already rattled in nine goals in all competitions so far, laying on three assists to boot. That tally includes an impressive hat-trick against Man City in Champions League Group A, although those heroics were to no avail as the Citizens won 6-3 at the Etihad back in September. According to Foot Mercato, City are among three of Europe's biggest clubs who are keeping tabs on Nkunku following his lightning start to the campaign. Chelsea and Real Madrid are also touted as potential suitors for the Paris Saint-Germain academy graduate. The report claims the player's agent Pini Zahavi believes his client is ready to take the next step in his career, and Los Blancos could make their move next summer. Zahavi also represents Real's David Alaba and has built a good relationship with the club after the Austrian moved to the Bernabeu in a free transfer in the summer. Meanwhile, Thomas Tuchel would supposedly be interested in a reunion with a player he gave regular game time to during his spell with PSG, but it may be that this is a convenient link amid the struggles of Chelsea's existing creative players so far this season. No evidence is given to back up the claim that Man City are interested too. Two for Nkunku          A #Bundesliga brace for @C_Nk97 in @RBLeipzig_EN's thumping win. ? pic.twitter.com/qlBHKMc526
