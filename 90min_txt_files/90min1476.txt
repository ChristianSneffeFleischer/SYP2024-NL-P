La Liga president Javier Tebas has warned Barcelona that they will be blocked from signing any new players until they make drastic cuts to their wage bill. Barcelona sold off a number of club assets to raise money for a transfer spree that saw the likes of Robert Lewandowski, Raphinha and Jules Kounde arrive at Camp Nou last summer, but stricter financial controls imposed by La Liga will prevent the Blaugrana from doing anything similar this year.    As of today, Barcelona doesn   t have any room in its budget to spend in the upcoming transfer window," Tebas told the Financial Times    Business of Football summit.    Barcelona has been involved in questionable behaviour which has had an impact on La Liga and we are acting accordingly. We have ruled that they can no longer sign more players.    They sold off    700m ( £620m) in TV rights and tried to find different ways to solve the situation but they won   t be able to do that next season. We have strict economic controls. At the end of each window, we tell all the clubs in La Liga what they can spend.

They have to reduce their investment in players and we have encouraged them to sell players because, for every amount they raise in sales, they can spend 40% of that.
