Frank Lampard has reiterated his desire to see Callum Hudson-Odoi become a success at Chelsea, amid doubts over his future following an influx of new signings. Hudson-Odoi was heavily linked with a move to Bayern Munich last year, but a move failed to materialise and instead he signed a new five-year deal at Stamford Bridge. But Hudson-Odoi has managed just four substitute appearances following the Premier League's resumption, fuelling speculation that he may be unhappy with his bit-part role at the club.  Indeed, The Independent suggested that the England winger may consider his future at the club if things don't change, but that notion was swiftly shot down by the Daily Mail, who indicated that sources close to the player had refuted such claims. Whatever the truth may be, head coach Lampard has now urged Hudson-Odoi to keep focused and knocking on the door for opportunities, speaking in his latest pre-match press conference. "I spoke about Callum a lot. He needs to keep training at the highest level which is actually what I've seen him doing," Lampard said. "He's a young player with great talent, great potential and I want to see that potential come through". Following the signings of both Timo Werner and Hakim Ziyech, competition for places in Chelsea's forward line is high. And with Kai Havertz also strongly linked with a move to Stamford Bridge, opportunities could become limited for some. ? ? ? ? ? ?  ? pic.twitter.com/5PnSrJjo15 Lampard has welcomed the competition, however, insisting that his players must continue to show hunger to keep their spot in the starting 11.
