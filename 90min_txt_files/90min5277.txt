West Ham's interest in promising defender Frederik Alves has been threatened by fresh interest from Serie A outfit Torino. The 20-year-old made 22 appearances last season for IF Silkeborg as they were relegated from the Danish Superliga, and has been capped for Denmark's Under-21s side on four occasions. Silkeborg had already previously announced on their website that Alves was due to leave the club in January, with only residence and work permits to be signed off on, although they refused to comment on which club had met the conditions to succesfully sign the centre-back.  4-1 sejr og sikke en pr  station fra ham her!??

BT claimed that the Hammers were close to agreeing a deal in the region of  Â£1.2m, with Alves expected to sign a contract that would keep him at the Olympic Stadium until 2024. New information from Calciomercato, has, however, complicated these original reports, with a brief but concise update claiming that Torino are ready to challenge the east London club for Alves, and have expressed an interest in the player.  Back at 100%?
