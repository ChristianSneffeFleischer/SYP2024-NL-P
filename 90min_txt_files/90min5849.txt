Lyon captain Memphis Depay has denied rumours saying he wanted to leave the club this summer, scoffing at suggestions that he could reunite with former Netherlands boss Ronald Koeman at Barcelona. The Dutchman returned from a cruciate ligament rupture sustained in December to play a pivotal role in Les Gones' impressive progression to the Champions League semi-finals, toppling Juventus and Manchester City along the way. He ended last season with a stellar tally of 15 goals in 21 games and started the 2020/21 campaign in fine fettle with a hat-trick in Lyon's 4-1 victory over Dijon in their opening game of the Ligue 1 season. The Dutchman, however, has previously been linked with a move to Barcelona, rumours which have been amplified following the arrival of former Dutch national team boss Ronald Koeman.  Depay, though, has declared that he is willing to see out his contract with Lyon until 2021. "I never said I wanted to leave [Lyon]," Depay told NOS (via Marca). "When I say something, many times it is distorted. "I still have a year left on my contract, I am a captain and we have a good team. I feel good about myself and my goals," he added. The 26-year-old also revealed the appointment of Koeman in Catalonia has done little to affect any decision regarding his future. "I have not spoken with Koeman yet," the former Manchester United man admitted. "He was involved in my recovery [from a cruciate ligament tear], he came to Rome to see me and when I was training in the Netherlands he was also with me, so the relationship is good.
