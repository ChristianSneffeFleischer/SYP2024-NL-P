20-year-old Santos striker Marcos Leonardo is being watched closely by a number of clubs from across Europe at the Under-20 World Cup, 90min understands. Leonardo, who already has over 140 senior appearances for his club, started both of Brazil's first two group games, scoring twice in a 3-2 defeat to Italy before adding another goal in a 6-0 win over the Dominican Republic. His performances so far have only increased the excitement around Leonardo, who has long been on the radars of some of Europe's elite clubs, many of whom have sent scouts to the Under-20 World Cup for further reports on the striker. Indeed, sources have confirmed to 90min that Juventus, Paris Saint-Germain and Roma are all watching the 20-year-old, while there is plenty of Premier League interest as well. feed West Ham, who failed with a bid in the January transfer window to sign Leonardo, have been represented at the tournament in Poland to keep tabs on Leonardo, while Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester United, Newcastle and Tottenham are all known admirers. Chelsea, who have stepped up their South American scouting with recent acquisitions of Andrey Santos and Kendry Paez, have taken a liking to the striker during their checks on teammate Santos. Leonardo has racked up 42 goals and ten assists for Santos, with his 13 strikes last season good enough for fifth place on the Serie A scoring charts. The 20-year-old, who cites Cristiano Ronaldo as his idol and has been compared to South American icon Sergio Aguero, is under contract in Brazil until the end of 2026.
