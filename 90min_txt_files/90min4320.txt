Nabil Fekir will set suitors Arsenal back 'a lot of money' this summer, according to Real Betis sporting director Antonio Cordon. Fekir has long been linked with a move to north London and they seem undeterred by his underwhelming production in recent times. During the 2017/2018 season the attacking midfielder was electric for Lyon, registering 18 goals and seven assists, form that attracted strong interest from Liverpool.  However, over the past two seasons he has managed just 12 La Liga goals for Betis. But while his productivity has waned, the club still consider him one of their most important players.  According to AS, Manuel Pellegrini views Fekir as someone he wants to build his attack around next season. His importance has also been espoused by Betis' sporting director.  Asked about the interest in Fekir, Cordon said: "In no club in the world is there is a non-transferable player. For us, it is a cornerstone to have him and keep him, if someone wants to come for him, they will have to pay a lot of money." Finances are not the only roadblock for a potential deal either; it is thought that Fekir has no desire to leave Betis during the upcoming transfer window.
