Leeds United's move for Bayern Munich prospect Michael Cuisance has fallen through, according to reports in Germany. It was widely reported earlier this week that the 21-year-old was poised to sign for the Whites with a fee of around  Â£20m agreed and a medical arranged. However, numerous journalists including Sky Germany reporter Max Bielefeld are now claiming that the deal is off. The reasons why negotiations collapsed have since been disputed. Fabrizio Romano has claimed that, at the last minute, the two clubs had a disagreement about the terms of payment as well as the insertion of a buy-back clause. Meanwhile, David Ornstein has reported that the player failing a medical was the real reason that the Whites pulled out of the deal. It is probable that Ornstein's version of events is the more accurate, with Romano likely being briefed by Bayern who wish to protect their player's value for a future sale. Cuisance has struggled to make an impact in Bavaria since signing from Borussia Monchengladbach in 2019, making just nine appearances for Hansi Flick's treble winning side last term. He's found playing time similarly hard to come by this season, being restricted to several cameos from the substitutes bench. This lack of first team opportunities meant Cuisance was keen to manufacture an Allianz Arena exit, but it now seems he him have to wait a bit longer to depart the club.
