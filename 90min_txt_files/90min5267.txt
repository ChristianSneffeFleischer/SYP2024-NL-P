Real Madrid striker Luka Jovic has finally agreed to pay the Serbian government a fine of    30,000 in order to avoid a six-month jail sentence, after he breached lockdown rules in March.  Jovic - who endured an extremely tough first season in Madrid in 2019/20 - was given permission by his club to travel home during lockdown in March. However, he was later pictured out on the streets celebrating his girlfriend's birthday despite the 14-day self-isolation measure still being in place.  El jugador del @realmadrid Jovic pacta con la fiscalia Serbia pagar 30.000      por saltarse el confinamiento el pasado mes de marzo y evita as   la posibilidad de ir a la carcel This led to major criticism from the Serbian government, while Real Madrid also weren't best pleased either. Serbian prosecutors were pushing for a six-month prison sentence for Jovic, but COPE's Melchor Ruiz has now reported that the saga appears to have finally drawn to a close after the 22-year-old agreed to pay the    30,000 fine.  Jovic hasn't exactly hit the ground running this campaign either. Having taken the 2019/20 season to settle in and adjust to his new surroundings, there was an expectation that he would raise his game and look to prove his worth to the Madrid faithful. Jovic has made five appearances in all competitions so far, but is yet to find the back of the net.
