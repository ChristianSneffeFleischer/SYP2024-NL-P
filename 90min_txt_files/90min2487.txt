Bayern Munich director Hasan Salihamidzic has doubled down on his insistence that the German side have not spoken with Tottenham striker Harry Kane about a possible transfer. Kane was on Bayern's radar this summer following Robert Lewandowski's exit and reports have even suggested the Bundesliga side are trying to convince Kane to run his contract down to facilitate a move in 2023 - something the club have already rejected. Salihamidzic has now gone one step further by stressing that they have never even spoken to Kane about a transfer, either this summer or next year.    I haven   t spoken to anyone in Harry Kane   s camp," Salihamidzic told Sport1.    We have faith in our players. Serge [Gnabry], Sadio [Mane], [Eric Maxim] Choupo-Moting and also [Mathys] Tel.    These are guys who should grow into it. We have eight players for four positions. In the end you have to see what the market has to offer and we didn   t find anyone is better than what was already in our squad.    Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  and  Toby Cudworth  bring you a brand new episode of Talking Transfers. The team discuss the fallout from the summer transfer window, Gavi's contract situation at Barcelona, Chelsea's midfield issues, Antony's suitability at Man Utd and more.

Kane's previous frustrations over Spurs' failure to challenge for silverware are well-known. The England striker pushed to join Manchester City last summer but instead remained at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, where he has worked closely with new manager Antonio Conte.
