Juventus have made contact with the representatives of Valencia's Ferran Torres, with one source claiming that talks are at an 'intensive stage' ahead of a proposed summer move to Turin. With six goals and seven assists in all competitions this season, Torres has been the standout star for  Los Ches, but his form has been unable to prevent them embarking on a run of just two wins in 13 matches - resulting in Albert Celades recently being sacked as manager.  No es momento de rendirse. Hay que pensar desde ya en el Villarreal! A post shared by  Ferran Torres (@ferrantorres7) on Jun 25, 2020 at 1:41pm PDT Torres has an  Â£87m release clause in his contract - one that runs until 2021 - and if Valencia are unable to tie him down long-term then they may seek to cash in this summer to avoid the risk of losing the 20-year-old for free. That has prompted a number of clubs to be linked, including the likes of Borussia Dortmund and Manchester United.  Just how concrete United's interest is is debatable given their interest in another attacker (need I say who?), but nevertheless, according to Onda Cero (via the Daily Mail), it is Juventus who have jumped to the front of the queue. The Spanish radio station claim that talks between the two clubs are now 'entering a genuinely intensive stage'. Juventus have recently been deploying Federico Bernardeschi on the right hand side of attack, but with Miralem Pjani   leaving for Barcelona, the (potential) addition of Torres may see the Italian move back into a central attacking role.
