Barcelona club president Joan Laporta has confirmed plans for when fans expect to see new signing Vitor Roque play.  La Blaugrana confirmed the    40m signing of Roque from Athletico Paranaense on Wednesday, fending off interest from the likes of Arsenal, Chelsea and Bayern Munich in order to secure the highly-rated youngster's signature.  The 18-year-old has signed a long-term deal at the club but will remain at Paranaense until 2024, something which was confirmed by president Laporta during an interview with Mundo Deportivo. "We have this feasibility plan and it is scheduled for January or June unless the foreseen circumstances improve, although they could still occur," Laporta said. feed Laporta also revealed what he expectes of Roque, who recently became Brazil's youngest ever player - beating a record previously held by Ronaldo. "Goals.  It is a very own style.  You can't compare it to Ronaldo or Romario, he is a player who gets into the penalty box and can shoot with both feet anywhere inside that area," he added. "I can't say that he is a Romario because he plays differently than a Romario, which was from a cartoon.  He has a lot of power and although he is very young, he can be compared to Ronaldo, who we had with a spectacular force of nature.  He is powerful and he is Brazilian."
