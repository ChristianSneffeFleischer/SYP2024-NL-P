Legendary former Barcelona and Inter striker Samuel Eto'o could be set for a remarkable return to professional football - in Spain's third tier. The 39-year-old announced his retirement from the game in September 2019 following a spell in Qatar, however a return to the country where he made his name may now be on the cards. Tercera Division side Racing Murcia are keen to bring the Cameroonian to southern Spain and draw him out of retirement, with a deal in the balance according to the club's president. Murcia, who were only promoted to Spain's third division last season, benefit from investment from the UAE and Mexico. Speaking to Radio Marca (as quoted by Sport Bible), club president Morris Pagniello said: "At this time of the morning I would say that the signing of Samuel Eto'o by our team is at 50-50. "Next week we will know if we can sign Eto'o. If not, we have a Plan B prepared. We have several investors in Mexico and the Emirates who can financially compensate the operation." Eto'o spent 12 years of his illustrious career in Spain, playing for Real Madrid, RCD Mallorca and Barcelona, winning La Liga three times and the Champions League twice with the latter and scoring 130 goals in 199 appearances in the process. The prolific front was ushered out of Bar  a by Pep Guardiola in 2009 in a controversial deal that would see him swapped for Inter's Zlatan Ibrahimovic, but Eto'o would have the last laugh as he secured another Champions League title under Jose Mourinho in 2010. In total he bagged 427 goals for club and country, in a career that spanned Spain, Italy, Russia, Turkey, Qatar and of course England, where he had spells with Chelsea and Everton.
