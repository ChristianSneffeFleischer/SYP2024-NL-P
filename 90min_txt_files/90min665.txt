Bayern Munich forward Sadio Mane has made a decision on his future following interest from the Saudi Pro League, 90min understands. Mane traded Liverpool for Bayern last summer and endured a troubling campaign as he struggled for form and ended up getting suspended by the club in April after a bust-up with Leroy Sane. The Senegal international was often used in a central role to compensate for the sale of Robert Lewandowski to Barcelona, but managed only seven Bundesliga goals, missed a chunk of the season with a leg injury and didn't start any of the final three league games as Bayern snatched the title. Mane could be forgiven for wanting a swift exit and a fresh start elsewhere, but he won't be following Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema and former Liverpool teammate Roberto Firmino to Saudi Arabia. feed The 31-year-old had been a target for the Saudi Pro League as it seeks to rival European football's established elite by poaching high profile names - albeit predominantly ageing ones. However, 90min understands that Mane is not even engaging with proposed talks and has no ambition to move to Saudi Arabia at this time. Bayern are hoping to recruit at the top end of the pitch going into 2023/24. The 11-time back-to-back Bundesliga champions have shown interest in France international Randal Kolo Muani, but have made an offer totalling    70m for Tottenham striker Harry Kane - although Spurs have denied receiving it and are adamant that such a bid would be rejected anyway. Landing a new 'number nine' could actually be a boost for Mane if it means being able to more consistently play in his favoured position wide on the left.
