PSG forward Edinson Cavani is keen to clinch a move to La Liga, according to his teammate Ander Herrera. Cavani is poised to bring his seven-year stay at Le Parc des Princes to a close this summer, with the 33-year-old's PSG contract expiring at the end of June. The Uruguay forward has been linked with a move to the likes of Manchester United, Inter and Atletico Madrid, with a move the the latter falling through in January as the two clubs could not agree a fee. Despite missing out on a move to La Liga in January, according to Cavani's teammate Herrera, the forward still has a desire to play in the top flight. The former Manchester United man told Diario AS [via the Daily Mail]: "I know Cavani wants to play in Spain. He loves the league and the country, he asks me about it a lot. However, since we left Paris I've not spoken to him about his situation." Cavani returned to his native Uruguay following Ligue 1's cancellation as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, with PSG securing their third successive league title. He is expected to travel back to France over the coming weeks to sort out his future. Cavani has seen injuries restrict his game time at PSG this season, starting just six times in the league all campaign. The striker has still found the net four times, but with Mauro Icardi making his move from Inter to PSG permanent at the end of May, his time on the pitch could be limited further next season.
