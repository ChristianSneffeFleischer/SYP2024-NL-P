Manchester United are among a number of clubs who sent scouts to watch highly-rated Benjamin Sesko over the weekend, 90min understands.  The 19-year-old is one of the most coveted young strikers in Europe right now thanks to his fantastic performances in the Austrian Bundesliga with Red Bull Salzburg. Sesko put in another impressive showing on Sunday, bagging a hat-trick in the final 10 minutes of his side's 4-2 win over Rapid Wien - a win which saw Salzburg estend their lead atop of the table to nine points.  90min understands that that game-winning performance was watched by Manchester United as well the likes of Tottenham, West Ham, Leicester, Wolves, Leeds and Inter.   manual While Sesko is already due to join Salzburg's sister club RB Leipzig this coming summer, Manchester United still view the player as a potential target - in theory the Bundesliga side could sell him and make a profit without him playing for them. As well as Sesko, sources confirmed to 90min that United scouts were also checking out full-back Amar Dedic and Danish talent Maurits Kjaergaard. Both players have become Salzburg regulars this season, with the former even breaking into the Bosnia & Herzegovina squad in 2022.
