Mesut Ozil's agent has confirmed that if his client moves to Turkey this month, he is only willing to join Fenerbahce.  Ozil is widely expected to depart Arsenal in January and bring a torrid few years to an end. The attacking midfielder has barely featured over the past two seasons with Mikel Arteta even leaving him out of the Gunners' 25-man Premier League squad at the beginning of the campaign.  Fenerbahce and MLS side DC United have both been reported to be leading the race for his signature recently, however 90min understands that the Turkish side have agreed a deal to sign him on loan this month, before recruiting him permanently when his contract expires at the end of the season.  Recently, Ozil said that he would like to play in both Turkey and the United States before he retires. His agent, Erkut Sogut, has since said that the only Turkish club he would consider joining is Fener, while also giving an update on the progress of negotiations.  "Mesut Ozil can now meet with any club he wants, sign a contract. Whatever is best for Mesut,"  he told beIN sports (via Asist Analiz). "Mesut only lacks match fitness. There is no training lacking. Mesut is fit for now. Everyone knows that Mesut is from Fenerbahce. He announced it yesterday. Mesut is not just a football player. Mesut is Fenerbahce.
