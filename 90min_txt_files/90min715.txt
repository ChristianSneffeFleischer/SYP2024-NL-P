We all know transfer fees have been going through the roof over the last decade. In fact, there seems to be no limit as to how high transfer fees can soar. It's one thing to shine brightly enough to be bought for tens of millions of pounds, but it is arguably more impressive to consistently command eye-watering sums of money across multiple moves. We're going to look at the players who have had the most spent on them in transfer fees during their career. manual Obviously. Zlatan Ibrahimovic had to feature here and just three or four years ago he would be ranked much higher. The Swedish star, who recently retired, has played for many of the biggest clubs in the world. Naturally, that means he has moved more than average and the fees have been larger than average. Money has been paid for Ibrahimovic's services on seven different occasions, with the biggest fee being the    69.5m (plus Samuel Eto'o) Barcelona paid Inter for him in 2009. Transfer Date Fee Malmo to Ajax July 1, 2001    7.8m Ajax to Juventus August 31, 2004    16m Juventus to Inter August 10, 2006    24.8m Inter to Barcelona July 27, 2009    69.5m Barcelona to AC Milan August 28, 2010    6m (loan fee) Barcelona to AC Milan July 1, 2011    24m AC Milan to PSG July 18, 2012    21m There was a time when it seemed Ousmane Dembele would light up European football for many years. Things have not quite panned out that way, mainly due to injuries, but he has still had some superb moments and there are plenty of years ahead of him.  Only two fees have ever been paid for Ousmane Dembele and one of them was absolutely massive. He joined Barcelona in 2017 for what was the second-biggest transfer fee ever paid at the time. Transfer Date Fee Stade Rennes to Borussia Dortmund July 1, 2016    35m Borussia Dortmund to Barcelona August 25, 2017    135m It is not quite to the same extent as Ibrahimovic, but Angel Di Maria has played for some very big clubs during his career. He has moved for a fee four times in his career, and three of them were very big at the time. Transfer Date Fee Rosario to Benfica July 27, 2007    8m Benfica to Real Madrid July 1, 2010    33m Real Madrid to Manchester United August 26, 2014    75m Manchester United to PSG August 6, 2015    63m This is a name that could well rise up the list in the future, although the idea of him leaving PSG for free in 2024 is very, very plausible now. Kylian Mbappe has only ever moved for one fee, but it was an absolute monster. If he goes for a price again, it could well be bigger depending on the circumstances. Transfer Date Fee Monaco to PSG July 1, 2018    180m Mbappe's France teammate, Antoine Griezmann, has racked up the same figure, but he has moved more frequently than his junior compatriot. Griezmann has moved for money on three occasions, although that is set to become four at the end of June when he signs permanently for Atletico Madrid. Transfer Date Fee Real Sociedad to Atletico Madrid July 28, 2014    30m Atletico Madrid to Barcelona July 14, 2019    120m Barcelona to Atletico Madrid August 31, 2021    10m (loan fee) Barcelona to Atletico Madrid July 1, 2023    20m (upcoming) Philippe Coutinho has had a very odd career. Without reaching the heights predicted in his youth, the trigger-happy Brazilian has still achieved plenty. He has had money paid for him on five occasions, and one of them was the record sale of a Premier League player. He still has time to achieve more at his current home, Aston Villa. Transfer Date Fee Vasco U17 to Inter July 23, 2008    3.8m Inter to Liverpool January 30, 2013    13m Liverpool to Barcelona January 8, 2018    135m Barcelona to Bayern Munich August 19, 2019    8.5m (loan fee) Barcelona to Aston Villa July 1, 2022    20m The hardest quiz question in football: Who does Alvaro Morata currently belong to?  The Spanish striker has been bouncing around a handful of big teams for years and to be fair, he has generally managed to score goals at every club he has played for. Money has been spent on him six times, and he is likely not far away from another move soon. Transfer Date Fee Real Madrid to Juventus July 19, 2014    20m Juventus to Real Madrid July 1, 2016    30m Real Madrid to Chelsea July 21, 2017    66m Chelsea to Atletico Madrid January 28, 2019    18m (loan fee) Chelsea to Atletico Madrid July 1, 2020    35m Atletico Madrid to Juventus September 22, 2020    20m (loan fee) He had to feature. There are two moves in particular that take Ronaldo to third on this list and one of them made him the most expensive player in the world for a short while. Ronaldo has been purchased on four different occasions, although his figure is now likely to stay the same given he is at Al Nassr in Saudi Arabia. Transfer Date Fee Sporting to Manchester United August 12, 2003    19m Manchester United to Real Madrid July 6, 2009    94m Real Madrid to Juventus July 10, 2018    117m Juventus to Manchester United August 31, 2021    17m The most expensive player in the world is not even at the top of the list. It is incredible really, but Neymar has only moved twice in his career so far. He is so high on the list because the two moves in question have been absolute whoppers. Transfer Date Fee Santos to Barcelona July 1, 2013    88m Barcelona to PSG August 3, 2017    222m Romelu Lukaku is not going to go down as one of the absolute greats of football, but he finds himself at the top of this list. He can be a devastatingly effective forward when the conditions are right for him, but his dips in form are too frequent.  That is part of why he is top of this list, as he has never quite settled anywhere. That being said, his level has always been high enough that he is worth paying a handsome fee for. Transfer Date Fee Anderlecht to Chelsea August 8, 2011    15m Chelsea to Everton September 2, 2013    3m (loan fee) Chelsea to Everton July 30, 2014    35.36m Everton to Manchester United July 10, 2017    84.7m Manchester United to Inter August 8, 2019    74m Inter to Chelsea August 12, 2021    113m Chelsea to Inter
