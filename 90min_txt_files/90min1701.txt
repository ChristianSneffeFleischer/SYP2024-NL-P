Brighton & Hove Albion have rejected a second bid from Arsenal for Moises Caicedo, sources have confirmed to 90min. Arsenal, like Chelesa, had their first offer for the Ecuadorian midfielder, worth around  £60m, rejected late last week, after which point Caicedo made public his desire to leave the club this month. Brighton reacted by allowed Caicedo time-off until after the window closed, as they maintained their stance that their prized midfielder was not for sale. Arsenal, though, have returned with an offer worth  £65m plus  £5m in add-onds but Brighton wasted no time in replying with a firm 'no'. Brighton insist that they will not be forced into selling Caicedo and have refused to either put a price-tag on him.
