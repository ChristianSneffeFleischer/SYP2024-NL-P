Arsenal are on the verge of confirming the signing of Ben White from Brighton, with the defender undergoing a medical this weekend. The  £50m deal will be a record sale for Brighton, while it would make White the third-most expensive signing in Arsenal history behind future teammates Nicolas Pepe ( £72m) and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang ( £56m). The Daily Mail write that the deal will be announced in due course with White completing a medical following his holiday at the conclusion of Euro 2020. White was a late call-up to Gareth Southgate's 26-man squad after Trent Alexander-Arnold pulled out with injury, though he did not play a single minute at the tournament as England marched on to the final. Arsenal have been on the hunt for defensive reinforcements after veteran David Luiz was released, while  £30m signing William Saliba has been loaned out for a third time, joining Marseille on a season-long deal. It's been a fairly busy window for the Gunners so far. They recently confirmed the signing of Albert Sambi Lokonga from Anderlecht in a deal worth around  £15m, while left-back Nuno Tavares signed from Benfica for just over half that amount.
