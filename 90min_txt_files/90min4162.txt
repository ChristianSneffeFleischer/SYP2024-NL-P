While many assumed Carlos Tevez would be hanging up his boots after announcing his departure from Boca Juniors in June, the Argentine player is rumored to have very different plans. During his last press conference with Boca Juniors, the 37-year-old left the door open to joining a new club.      I don   t know if to say that I will retire because I might wake up in three months with the urge to play and return to the pitch. If I do though, it will not be with a Boca jersey, not anymore,    Tevez told reporters. The striker kicked off his football career with the Argentinian club at the age of 16 in 2001. He went on to play four seasons with the team before transferring to Brazil, while he later thrived in England and Italy. He eventually made his way back to his roots in 2015 and then again in 2018.   Since his recent press conference, speculation began to soar regarding the player   s future. According to ESPN, three Major League Soccer sides are interested in the former Manchester City and Juventus forward.  Among those rumored teams is David Beckham   s Inter Miami, a club with five other Argentinians in the roster. Despite Inter Miami   s recent sanctions capping the club from overspending, the club currently maintains the financial muscle to offer the player a lucrative deal before retiring.     ESPN   s Augusto C  sar also mentioned the possibility of Atlanta United as Tevez has connections to current head coach Gabriel Heinze. The two spent six years together playing for the Argentinian national team after Tevez made his debut in 2004. Despite the bond, Heinze casually brushed off the rumor in a recent conference.   "I don't have anything to say because I haven't spoken to Carlos in a very long time," Heinze told media.
