Tottenham Hotspur wing-back Matt Doherty is on the verge of joining Atletico Madrid on loan for the rest of the season, sources have told 90min. Spurs had been looking to shift some of their current right-sided options this month to make room for Pedro Porro, who will join from Sporting CP on deadline day after a tough few weeks of negotiations. Djed Spence is in France ahead of finalising a straight six-month loan to Rennes, and 90min understands that Doherty is now on his way to Atletico Madrid. The Irishman will similarly leave Spurs on a standard loan deal, which Atletico Madrid will confirm once centre-back Felipe completes his move to Nottingham Forest. Listen now as  Scott Saunders  hosts  Graeme Bailey  and  Toby Cudworth  to discuss why Joao Cancelo looks set to join Bayern Munich on loan from Man City, Arsenal's ongoing pursuit of Moises Caicedo & the futures of Pedro Porro, Enzo Fernandez, Youri Tielemans and more.
