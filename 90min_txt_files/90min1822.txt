Newcastle striker Chris Wood is set to undergo a medical at fellow Premier League club Nottingham Forest as he nears an initial loan switch, 90min understands. 90min had reported earlier on Thursday that the Magpies are prepared to sanction Wood   s exit this month. He has fallen behind Callum Wilson and Alexander Isak in the St James    Park pecking order, with the latter making his return from injury in the last couple of weeks. Wood, who was a  Â£25m capture from Burnley only 12 months ago, has scored only two Premier League goals for Newcastle this season and has had to make do with all but four of his 18 appearances coming from the bench. Leeds had enquired about the New Zealand international, who played at Elland Road from 2015 to 2017. Everton, Southampton and Bournemouth have also been keeping tabs on him. But it is Nottingham Forest, having already entered talks, who have taken things on. 90min understands the deal will take the form of a loan with a view to permanent summer transfer.
