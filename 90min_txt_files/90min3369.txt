Barcelona president Joan Laporta has revealed that the club will discuss a potential short-term contract extension with Dani Alves, whose current deal expires at the end of the season.  Alves has proved that he still belongs at the top level since returning to Camp Nou in January, making 16 appearances in all competitions and establishing himself as Xavi's go-to right-back.  Despite recently turning 39, the defender continues to turn out for the Brazilian national team too, for whom he has now played for 123 times - just 19 shy of all-time appearance maker Cafu.  Alves has hinted that he would be open to penning an extension. Laporta has now added his input, confirming that the club would negotiate with the player soon.
