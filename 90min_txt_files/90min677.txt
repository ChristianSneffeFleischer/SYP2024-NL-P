Brighton are the latest club to show interest in Ajax star Mohammed Kudus, 90min understands, with Manchester United already exploring a possible deal in recent months. Kudu scored three goals in the Champions League group stage, including against Liverpool, during the first half of 2022/23 and then went on to impress at the 2022 World Cup with Ghana. During the tournament, 90min reported that Arsenal, Tottenham and Newcastle all made enquiries, with Liverpool already aware of his ability and Everton retaining interest after failing to get a proposed  Â£15m deal over the line last summer. Borussia Dortmund, PSG, Lyon, Napoli and Atletico Madrid were also keeping tabs on the player   s progress in Qatar. United began exploring a possible transfer for the versatile attacking player in January when they were trying to source a replacement for Cristiano Ronaldo. Ultimately, however, the Old Trafford preferred a cheaper option at that time and recruited Wout Weghorst on loan. feed But Erik ten Hag remains keen on a new forward and has already worked extensively with Kudus, who has operated as a number 10, number nine and on the right flank for Ajax this past season, owing to two years already spent together in Amsterdam. 90min understands that United remain keen on Kudus now and don   t view the 22-year-old as an alternative to Mason Mount, for whom three bids have been rejected by Chelsea, given that their interest in the Ghanaian dates back a number of months already. But there will be increased competition for his signature. Brighton are not only interested, but have also established contact with the player   s representatives and held early talks.
