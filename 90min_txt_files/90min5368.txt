Burnley winger Dwight McNeil has committed his long-term future to the Clarets by singing a new four-year contract that promises to keep him at Turf Moor until 2024. The fresh terms also include an optional further 12 months until the summer of 2025. The 20-year-old emerged from the Burnley youth ranks in 2018 and has become an increasingly key player in Sean Dyche   s team over the last two seasons.  A new long-term contract for Dwight McNeil ? A post shared by  Burnley Football Club (@burnleyofficial) on Oct 16, 2020 at 5:03am PDT Last season, McNeil started all 38 of Burnley   s Premier League games and jointly led the Clarets in assists alongside Ashley Westwood. He also scored two goals of his own.    I   m delighted to sign a new contract. I love playing for the club and it   s a club I want to be at,    McNeil told Burnley   s official website.    It   s a great position to be in and I couldn   t have asked for more help from the lads, to be honest. My focus was always to be a Burnley player and carry on doing what I   m doing because I love the club, I love the team and playing for the gaffer and that   s what I want to carry on doing.    McNeil made his Burnley debut as a last-minute substitute on the final day of the 2017/18 campaign, before again linking up with the first-team for Europa League qualifiers that summer. The left-sided star made his full Premier League debut soon afterwards against Manchester United, the club that had released him as a 14-year-old, before he then made a decisive impact in 2-0 win over West Ham in December 2018 and never looked back.
