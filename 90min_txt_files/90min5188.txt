Milan are closing in on an agreement with star goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma over a contract extension. The 21-year-old's current deal at the club expires at the end of the season, meaning the Rossoneri have left it incredibly late to wrap up a new contract for their star shot-stopper.  Donnarumma has emerged as one of Serie A's finest goalkeepers after establishing himself as a regular in a declining Milan side as a 16-year-old during the 2015/16 campaign. He's gone on to become Italy's number one and has already made a remarkable 216 appearances in Rossoneri colours.  His impressive consistency has continued into 2020/21, with Milan enjoying a superb start to the season under Stefano Pioli. Donnarumma's kept three clean sheets in seven league appearances, conceding just five times, as his side currently top the table.  A priority of the Rossoneri this season, though, has been to ensure the precocious Donnarumma signs a new deal at the club, with Calcio Mercato reporting that a renewal is edging closer.  His is set to be worth    7m net per season, so a slight pay rise from the current    6m. The report adds that the extension has been delayed due to the request of the Italian's agent, Mino Raiola, who wanted to ensure his client was signing for a competitive Milan, one able to contend for Scudetti and fight for silverware.
