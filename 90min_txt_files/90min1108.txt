Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag has fielded questions over Marcus Rashford's prolonged contract saga. Rashford's deal was set to expire this summer but the Red Devils triggered a one-year extension clause earlier in the season, giving them further time to thrash out terms over a fresh contract. Though talks are ongoing, the forward has not yet committed his long-term future to Man Utd and there has been minor but growing unrest among fans that their star forward could leave. Ten Hag was asked about Rashford's contract situation ahead of Saturday's trip to Bournemouth and if he knew the reasons why a new deal hasn't been signed yet. "Yes, I know [why], but I don't talk about the process. Let the process go," Ten Hag replied. "Once again, this is not important at the moment for me or Rashy. For him, it is to get more goals this season and he is playing a wonderful season and the team is playing a wonderful season. We have to get into the Champions League and focus on that. "Marcus wants to stay and we want him to stay, so I think we will find each other."
