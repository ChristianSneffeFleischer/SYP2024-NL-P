Moukoko. who is out of contract at the end of the season, has publicly stated that a decision will be made about his future soon, but sources close to the club and player have told 90min that he's yet to finalise his plans. Dortmund remain hopeful that Moukoko will commit to the club long-term deal - even though talks over a new contract have been going on for the best part of a year - but a host of top teams from around Europe are keeping an eye on his situation, hopeful that they can lure him away.
