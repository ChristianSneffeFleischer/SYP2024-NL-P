Isco is keen to stay at Real Madrid this summer, despite falling out of favour with Zinedine Zidane.  The Spaniard was instrumental in Zidane's first reign as Los Blancos boss - starring in the 2017 Champions League final victory over Juventus - but has failed to convince the Frenchman since he returned for his second stint last March. Isco made 30 appearances in all competitions last term, scoring three times and adding a mere two assists.  The 28-year-old is one of the players the Spanish supergiants are looking to get off their books this summer, but Mundo Deportivo reports that it's the player's desire to remain in Madrid. Thus, Zizou isn't convinced the club will be able to offload Isco in the current window. Although, Real are ready to convince the Spaniard to depart by telling him that he'll continue to play a rotational role next season.  No club, however, has contacted Los Blancos or Isco's agent (his father) regarding a potential transfer as of yet. The midfielder's contract at the Bernabeu expires in the summer of 2022, meaning he could force a low-cost transfer at the end of next season, or even walk on a free when his contract's up.  But why would such a gifted footballer want to waste his prime playing a minimal role in a rebuilding side?  Nevertheless, it's understood that Los Blancos' valuation of the player - which is believed to be between    40m and    50m - has put off clubs pursuing a deal amid the financial constraints triggered by the coronavirus pandemic.
