Fulham's hopes of bringing in Justin Kluivert hang in the balance after he was refused a work permit, 90min understands. The Cottagers had hopes of signing the winger prior to Thursday's transfer deadline, but they are fading fast. Kluivert has not been granted a work permit despite being a two-time Netherlands international and playing 31 times for Nice last season. Fulham have been shocked by this development and while they are still looking at ways to complete the deal, they are also ready to explore other options ahead of the window shutting on Thursday. Versatile Marseille forward Bamba Dieng is admired at Craven Cottage and 90min recently reported on widespread Premier League interest in the 22-year-old. Fulham are in talks over a possible deal for Dieng, though Everton too are in discussions with Marseille. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  &  Toby Cudworth  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Lucas Paqueta's move to West Ham, Chelsea's plans to sign Anthony Gordon, Wesley Fofana and Arsen Zakharyan and the latest from Old Trafford.
