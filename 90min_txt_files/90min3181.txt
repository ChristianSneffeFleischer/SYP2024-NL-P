Barcelona could make a shock swoop to sign Cristiano Ronaldo this summer with club president Joan Laporta and the player's agent Jorge Mendes holding talks. Chelsea are also considering a move for Ronaldo, although the 37-year-old is not thought to be 100% convinced over whether a move to Stamford Bridge is the correct next step. Paris Saint-Germain have been linked with Ronaldo too, in a move that would see CR7 link up with long-time rival Lionel Messi. The forward is willing to take a significant wage cut to secure his Old Trafford exit.  Chelsea are in advanced talks to sign England winger Raheem Sterling, who Manchester City value at around  £50m. Timo Werner, Christian Pulisic and Hakim Ziyech, who has loan interest from AC Milan, could be heading in the other direction at Stamford Bridge with further changes expected under Chelsea's new ownership.  Tottenham have enquired about the possibility of signing Memphis Depay from Barcelona this summer. The Blaugrana could allow the Dutchman to leave for  £20m as they look to balance their books. Spurs remain interested in signing Pau Torres, despite the imminent arrival of Clement Lenglet on loan.  Eder Militao and Rodrygo have each agreed new long-term deals with Real Madrid. Both contracts include a    1bn release clause.  Marco Asensio is waiting to see if Liverpool make a bid for his services before committing his future to Real.
