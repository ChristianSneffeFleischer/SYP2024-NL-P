Pogba is now set to embark on a second spell at another club: Juventus. Sources have told 90min that the World Cup winner has agreed a four-year deal at the Allianz Stadium. Despite having had offers from both Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain, Pogba has opted to rejoin Juve due to his family's love for the city of Turin. On the footballing side, Pogba was also enthused by Juventus' proposal of building a competitive team around him and the opportunity to work with esteemed manager Max Allegri again. The midfielder arguably enjoyed the two best club seasons of his career under Allegri between 2014 and 2016, winning two league and cup doubles, reaching the UEFA Champions League final, and earning a spot in the FIFPro World XI.
