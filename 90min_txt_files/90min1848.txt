Leicester City's initial offer for Argentina forward Nicolas Gonzalez has been knocked back by Fiorentina, sources have told 90min. The Foxes are determined not to get dragged into a relegation dogfight following a rather miserable 2022/23 season so far. With that in mind, Leicester have been busy trying to bring in Gonzalez to add further quality and depth to their frontline. 90min reported on Monday that personal terms have now been agreed with the 24-year-old. However, 90min now understands that Leicester's opening bid of  Â£30m has been turned down by Fiorentina. Leicester will not give up on a deal and are expected to return with another offer for Gonzalez, who has scored five goals in 13 games for La Viola this season. Fiorentina have publicly insisted that they are not inclined to sell Gonzalez or World Cup star Sofyan Amrabat, while Atletico Madrid are also interested in signing the former. However, they are currently unwilling to match Leicester's financial package, which includes doubling Gonzalez's wages. Due to previous Financial Fair Play constraints, Leicester were only able to make two senior signings in the summer of 2022 - backup goalkeeper Alex Smithies on a free transfer and Wout Faes from Reims.
