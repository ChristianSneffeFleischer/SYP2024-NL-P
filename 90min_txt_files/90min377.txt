Bayern Munich honorary president Uli Hoeness has spoken about the club's hopes of signing Harry Kane this summer. Tottenham Hotspur have rejected two bids from the Bavarians for their star striker already this window and are insistent that he will not be sold. 90min understands that Spurs chairman Daniel Levy did meet with Bayern CEO Jan-Christian Dreesen this week, but does not intend to do business with any team regarding Kane, who is now into the final 12 months of his contract. Bayern are readying a club-record bid for Kane worth more than    80m and head coach Thomas Tuchel revealed on Saturday that they are ready to go 'all in' for the right transfer target. Speaking to the press shortly after Tuchel, Hoeness - who retains a place on Bayern's supervisory board - made candid comments about Kane, Levy and Tottenham. feed "He [Kane] signalled very clearly that his decision was made. And if it stays that way, we'll get him," Hoeness insisted. "Levy is clever. First we have to get him to name a price. He plays for time, is a great professional. I appreciate him very much. But on the other side [at Bayern] there aren't any people who have been doing this since yesterday. "He wants to play internationally [in Europe]. Tottenham won't be there next season, unlike our club. He now has another opportunity to come to a top club in Europe. "What we really like about Kane is that his advisors, that is his father and his brother, are very pleasant. So far they have always stood by what they have promised. And if it stays that way, then that's okay."
