West Ham are prioritising a move for Club Brugge midfielder Hans Vanaken before the transfer deadline next week.  The Hammers have endured an indifferent start to the 2020/21 campaign, losing two of their opening three Premier League encounters before falling to a 4-1 at Everton in the fourth round of the Carabao Cup on Wednesday night.  The club have been pretty inactive in the transfer window up until this point, with their move to secure box-to-box midfielder Tomas Soucek on a permanent basis from Slavia Prague the only bit of business West Ham have conducted thus far.  That is set to change, though, with the east Londoners poised to welcome Soucek's former teammate Vladimir Coufal to the London Stadium after agreeing a  £5m deal with the Czech giants. The Hammers have also reportedly tabled a  £20m bid for Napoli defender Nikola Milenkovic in their hunt for defensive reinforcements.  Belgian news outlet HLN, meanwhile, reports the Premier League side are looking to wrap up a deal for Club Brugge creator Vanaken, although a deal is proving tricky. West Ham are said to have had a    15m bid rejected by the Belgian giants for the 28-year-old, who notched 16 goal contributions in 29 league appearances last time out and has started the 2020/21 campaign with four goals and a pair of assists in seven games.  Brugge value Vanaken much higher than West Ham's initial    15m offer and are keen to keep him on their books this summer. The Belgian has been a pivotal part of title-winning and Champions League-entering Brugge sides since his arrival from Lokeren in 2015.
