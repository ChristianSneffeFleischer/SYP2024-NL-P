Barcelona defender Clement Lenglet is undergoing a medical ahead of a loan move to Tottenham Hotspur, 90min can confirm. Spurs reached an agreement with Barca over a season-long deal for the Frenchman at the end of June, and he has now arrived in north London to go through the formalities before completing the switch. Head coach Antonio Conte has been on the lookout for a left-footed centre-back to fit his three-at-the-back system and Tottenham turned their attention to Lenglet after being rejected by Inter's Alessandro Bastoni. The Frenchman spent the majority of last season on the fringes of the starting lineup at Camp Nou, often only being afforded appearances off the bench. As such, he has been deemed surplus to requirements for the time being. However, contrary to what was previously believed, there is no option to buy included in the loan agreement and it will instead be a straight one-year loan for the 27-year-old - although there is likely scope for that to be re-negotiated at a later date.
