Everton are among the Premier League clubs showing an interest in Aston Villa forward Danny Ings as the January transfer window picks up pace, 90min understands. Ings joined Villa for  Â£25m as recently as 2021 but has struggled to have the same kind of impact he had at former club Southampton, for whom he scored 22 Premier League goals in 2019/20. His 12 league goals in 18 months as a Villa player only matches his tally from his final season with the Saints. The 30-year-old, who previously made his name at Burnley and had an injury-ravaged spell at Liverpool, has only started one of the five Premier League games new boss Unai Emery has taken charge of since his appointment at the start of November. Ings did score twice in an important 2-1 victory over Brighton in that sole start, yet has had to make do with substitute appearances against Manchester United, Liverpool and Tottenham. He has also been named on the bench again for Wednesday night   s midlands derby against Wolves. Everton have struggled in front of goal this season, scoring only 14 times in 18 league games. But the Toffees are not the only club interested in a potential deal for Ings. Southampton are also keeping watch, as are Bournemouth. All three clubs are in the Premier League   s bottom six and are in desperate need of attacking firepower.
