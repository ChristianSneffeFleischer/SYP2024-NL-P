Manchester United are in talks over a potential deal to sign Jack Butland from Crystal Palace, sources have told 90min. The Red Devils are in the market for another goalkeeper, particularly after Martin Dubravka's loan from Newcastle was cut short. Their search has led them to Palace, and 90min understands that they asked the Eagles about the availability of both Sam Johnstone - who came through United's academy - and Butland. Palace informed them that only Butland is available for departure. United and Palace are now working to complete a deal immediately. Butland's contract is up at the end of the season and Erik ten Hag is keen to add a deputy to David de Gea to his squad this month. The 29-year-old joined the south London side from Stoke for a fee of around  Â£1m in 2020, and while he has largely acted as a backup to Vicente Guaita for most of his time at Selhurst Park, he has made 15 appearances in all competitions this season. Butland was part of England's Euro 2012 and World Cup 2018 squads, earning nine senior caps for the Three Lions.
