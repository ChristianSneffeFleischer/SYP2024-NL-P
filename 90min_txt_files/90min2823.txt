Arsenal have confirmed midfielder Lucas Torreira has left the club to join Turkish giants Galatasaray on a permanent deal. The Uruguayan was a quick hit at the Emirates - once scoring in a north London derby victory over Tottenham - but soon fell out of Mikel Arteta's starting XI and spent time away at Atletico Madrid and Fiorentina on loan. His exit has now been finalised and he will join a Galatasaray outfit who have also recruited former Napoli forward Dries Mertens. Arsenal's statement reads: "Everyone at Arsenal thanks Lucas for his contribution during his time with us. We wish Lucas and his family the best of health and happiness in their new chapter with Galatasaray. "The deal is subject to the completion of regulatory processes." Galatasaray themselves have revealed Torreira has signed a four-year contract with the club, with Arsenal receiving    6m as a transfer fee.
