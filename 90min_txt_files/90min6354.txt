Manchester United have 'entered the race' to sign Ben Chilwell, with Manchester City and Chelsea still both interested in the Leicester defender.  The England international has been ever present for Brendan Rodgers side this season, making 33 appearances and helping the Foxes mount an unlikely Champions League qualification bid.  His performances have long seen him linked with a move away from the King Power Stadium with Manchester City and Chelsea believed to be his most likely destinations. The Blues are in dire need of a new left-back and are willing to sell a number of first team players in order to finance the deal. City, another of Chilwell's long-term admirers, are lining up the 23-year-old to replace Benjamin Mendy who has endured another injury plagued season.  As well as interest from these two Premier League giants, the Sun report that United have now entered the fray, as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer looks to build a squad capable of challenging for the title next season.

United have experience negotiating with the Foxes, recruiting centre-back Harry Maguire from the club for a world record fee last summer.
