Southampton have held talks with Dinamo Zagreb over a potential deal for star winger Mislav Orsic, 90min understands. The 30-year-old scored one of the goals of the 2022 World Cup during Croatia's third-place play-off victory against Morocco with a brilliant looping finish into the top corner. He has also gained a reputation as a big-game player for Dinamo Zagreb, scoring important goals against Tottenham, West Ham and Chelsea in European competition in recent seasons. Sources have told 90min that Southampton are hoping to wrap up a    10m deal for Orsic, who is keen to make the move to St. Mary's. Bournemouth, Everton and Nottingham Forest have also been in contact with Dinamo Zagreb in recent weeks. 90min also understands that Southampton remain in talks with Lorient over the signing of striker Terem Moffi. While there is plenty of rival interest in him from England and across Europe, the Saints remain favourites to secure his signature.
