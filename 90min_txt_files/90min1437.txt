Brighton and Hove Albion are set to offer Kaoru Mitoma a new long-term contract at the club, 90min understands.  Mitoma has been one of the breakout stars of the 2022/23 Premier League season, scoring six goals in 12 starts as Brighton have mounted an unlikely top four challenge.  The 25-year-old's form since the turn of the year has been particularly impressive as he's managed eight goal contributions from the left flank in that period - including a famous FA Cup winner against Liverpool at the Amex Stadium.  READ NEXT manual This fantastic form is not set to go unrewarded by his current club as 90min can reveal that Mitoma is set to be offered a huge pay rise and a long-term extension. Initial talks between the club and the player's representatives are underway, and there is optimism around agreeing terms as Mitoma is said to be very happy in Brighton.  Mitoma was of interest to Arsenal during the January transfer window but the Seagulls quickly made it clear the Japan international was not for sale, unlike Leandro Trossard, who was permitted to move to the Emirates Stadium. As well as Mitoma, Solly March is also set to be rewarded with a new contract. 90min understands that an agreement is not far away for March following another stellar campaign with the coastal club which has yielded five goals and five assists.
