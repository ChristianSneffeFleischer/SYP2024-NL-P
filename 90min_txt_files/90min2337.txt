Tottenham Hotspur are not worried about the prospect of Son Heung-min leaving the club amid reports linking him with the likes of Real Madrid, 90min understands. Son has endured a difficult start to the 2022/23 season at club level, but remains one of world football's most feared forwards and placed 11th for the 2022 Ballon d'Or. Prior to the start of his 2021/22 Premier League Golden Boot-winning campaign, the South Korean signed a new contract in north London running until 2025. But German outlet Sport1 reported this week that he is considering a new challenge in his career and that he was being watched closely by Real Madrid, while Bayern Munich and PSG were also touted as potential destinations. However, 90min understands that even if Son were to want out of Spurs, the club would not consider his departure for another couple of years at least.
