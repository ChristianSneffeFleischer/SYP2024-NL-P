Marseille have announced an agreement in principle to sign Morocco international Azzedine Ounahi from fellow Ligue 1 club Angers. Ounahi burst onto the scene as one of the Atlas Lions' main stars in their run to the 2022 World Cup semi finals. A number of clubs had been tracking the midfielder in the previous year and their interest grew thanks to the 22-year-old's sterling performances against the likes of Spain and Portugal. Leicester opened talks with Angers but their offer of around    28m wasn't enough to land the Foxes the midfielder. They were soon joined by Napoli and Leeds in making bids, but Marseille have gazumped the lot of them and announced the deal. Their statement reads: "Olympique de Marseille announces an agreement in principle with Angers SCO, for the permanent transfer of Azzedine Ounahi to the club." 22-year-old Ounahi has made 17 appearances for Morocco, scoring two goals. His towering performance against Spain drew particular praise from Luis Enrique, who said: "My God, where does this guy come from? I was pleasantly surprised by their number eight. I don't remember his name, I'm sorry." On this edition of Talking Transfers, Scott Saunders hosts Toby Cudworth & Graeme Bailey to discuss some of the latest transfer news.
