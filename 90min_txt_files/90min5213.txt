Manchester City's search for a long-term successor to Sergio Aguero has led to Benfica scoring sensation Darwin Nunez. 32-year-old Aguero, who is out of contract at the end of the season, remains an important member of Pep Guardiola's side, but 90min revealed earlier this week that the club are aware that the Argentine only has a few years left at the highest level. City do already have Gabriel Jesus on their books, but the club's hierarchy are concerned whether the Brazilian is capable of becoming their next talismanic striker. Erling Haaland and Lautaro Martinez are top of their wish list should they dip into the transfer market, but the Telegraph add that Benfica striker Nunez is also a player of interest. The 21-year-old joined Benfica just two months ago for  £21.8m, and he's already shown glimpses of his potential. Nunez has scored just once in the league, but has four Europa League goals to his name in just three games - having netted a hat-trick against Lech Poznan in a 4-2 win. Nunez also has six Benfica assists to his name, as well as two international goals for Uruguay; indicating that he's a more rounded modern forward, rather than an out-and-out finisher. Inter's Romelu Lukaku is said to have been a player that City were considering in the summer, but it's mooted that a move was put on ice in the summer after the Nerazzurri placed a  £93.75m price tag on the prolific Belgian. Harry Kane is another name thrown into the mix, but Tottenham's reluctance to sell - and their own lofty ambitions - are huge stumbling blocks for City to overcome.
