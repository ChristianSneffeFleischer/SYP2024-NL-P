Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta has all but confirmed that star academy striker Folarin Balogun will stay at the club and sign a new contract. The 18-year-old was expected to leave the Emirates Stadium this summer after failing to get assurances over first-team minutes going forward. Reports suggested that he could be set to sign for a Bundesliga club on a free transfer, but he's now expected to pen a new deal with the Gunners. Manager Arteta essentially confirmed the news during his pre-match presser ahead of the Europa League quarter-final second leg against Slavia Prague, insisting he was always confident the player wanted to stay.

We want him to stay at the club so we are very close." Premier League sides Manchester City, Everton and Crystal Palace had all expressed an interest while sides from abroad like VFB Stuttgart and Monaco were also keen on bringing him in to their club. Reports suggested that Bayer Leverkusen were closest to agreeing a pre-contract agreement with the striker, who scored his first professional goal earlier this season in the Europa League against Molde, but it seems Arteta was able to convince him to stay.
