Fulham have offered Barcelona icon Gerard Pique a chance to return to England, according to reports in Spain.  Barca are poised for a significant squad overhaul this summer following a humiliating 8-2 Champions League quarter final defeat to Bayern Munich.  The vast majority of the Blaugrana squad have been put up for sale with club president Josep Maria Bartomeu suggesting that only Marc-Andre ter Stegen, Clement Lenglet, Frenkie de Jong, Nelson Semedo, Ousman   Demb  l  , Antoine Griezmann and Lionel Messi are guaranteed to survive the mass clear-out.  Pique admitted after Bayern defeat that it could be time for him to move on and Fulham have wasted little time in offering the Spaniard a way out of Catalonia. According to Libero (via Sport), the  Cottagers are keen to add some experience to their squad and think Pique fits the bill.  Whether or not the Premier League newbies have the financial power or prestige to tempt the centre-back to west London remains to be seen. Pique does have some experience in English football, making 23 appearances for Manchester United before returning to boyhood club Barcelona in 2008. Since arriving back at Camp Nou he has won a host of major honours, including eight La Liga titles, six Copas del Rey and three Champions League crowns. He's also decorated on the international stage, lifting the European Championships in 2012 and also winning the 2010 World Cup.
