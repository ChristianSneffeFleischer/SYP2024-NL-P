Chelsea have agreed a deal to send young midfielder Andrey Santos on loan to Brazilian side Palmeiras, 90min understands. Santos joined from Vasco da Gama in January for an initial  Â£18m but, due to his previous club's standing in the second tier of Brazilian football, did not immediately qualify for a work permit to play in England. After playing a starring role at the South American Under-20 Championships, Chelsea had hoped that Santos would be granted a permit by the FA's Exceptions Panel but the Blues' appeal was knocked back. With Santos not qualifying for a work permit at this point, Chelsea have agreed a loan deal to send the teenager back to his homeland with Brazilian giants Palmeiras, who have fought off interest from a number of teams to secure Santos' signature. Santos will join Palmeiras on a 12-month loan deal but Chelsea have negotiated the option to terminate the move in the summer and bring the 18-year-old back to Stamford Bridge early. On this edition of Talking Transfers, part of the 90min podcast network,  Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  &  Toby Cudworth  discuss the Premier League's managerial merry-go-round with the latest on the situations at Leeds United and Southampton.

With Palmeiras playing top-flight football and also featuring in the Copa Libertadores after winning the domestic title last season, the expectation is that Santos will qualify for a permit in England by the time this agreement comes to an end. There was no shortage of interest in the services of Santos, who finished joint-top scorer of the international competition to cement his place as one of the brightest prospects not only in South America, but anywhere in the world.
