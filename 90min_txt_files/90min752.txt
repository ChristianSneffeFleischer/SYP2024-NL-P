Newcastle United are in talks over a potential deal for Milan midfielder Sandro Tonali, sources have confirmed to 90min. A new defensive midfielder is among Newcastle's top priorities for this summer's transfer window and they have been exploring numerous options. They were linked with Inter's box-to-box midfielder Nicolo Barella, but it soon transpired that Newcastle's  £50m valuation of him was well off Inter's price tag and the player himself showed little desire in making a move. However, 90min understands that Newcastle have also been doing their homework on Tonali, who unlike Barella is open to the prospect of moving to England. feed Newcastle are in talks with the player's representatives as they want to make sure that he has a desire to move to Tyneside before making a firm offer, and early talks have gone well. Tonali, who is due to captain Italy at this summer European Under-21 Championships, is attracted by the option Newcastle are presenting to him. Newcastle are now ready to step up talks with Milan and are ready to offer  £50m for Tonali, who enjoyed an outstanding campaign in Serie A last season, registering seven assists from midfield. The Magpies are also continuing talks over a deal for James Maddison, but as it stands they are not prepared to meet Leicester's asking price of  £60m.
