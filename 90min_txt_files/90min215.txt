Ajax sporting director Sven Mislintat has confirmed that they have received enquiries over versatile midfielder Mohammed Kudus. 90min reported earlier in the week that Chelsea had reached out to Kudus' representatives to strike an agreement over personal terms, while Arsenal, Manchester United and Brighton also retain interest in the 22-year-old. "There are clubs that have informally enquired about him," Mislintat told Ajax Life. "I don   t expect an offer very soon, although you know that things can be different in the football world. Perhaps the interest in not as serious as everyone thinks." feed In a separate interview with Aglemeen Dagblad, Mislintat acknowledged that Ajax could lose both Kudus and West Ham target Edson Alvarez, but warned suitors that the Dutch outfit will not sell without first finding a replacement. "There is no fixed deadline, but there are agreements we must have to get replacements if we have not already done so proactively," he explained. "Their stay or sale also depends on what we will do next. "The best thing for is if Kudus and Alvarez stay, then we keep two top players. But it is also possible that one goes, or both. "It is important for us that the relationship with the players remains good. This can be done by being transparent and applying good principles. As we get closer to the deadline, the transfer fee, for example, goes up."
