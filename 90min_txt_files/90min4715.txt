As one of the greatest strikers England has ever produced, it seems almost criminal that Harry Kane's trophy cabinet is still empty. The 27-year-old has twice suffered the agony of being a beaten finalist with Tottenham - in the 2015 League Cup and the 2019 Champions League - and the lack of silverware throughout his career so far has led many to suggest he could be looking for a way out of the club. Kane has regularly insisted he's happy to remain at Spurs as long as they are progressing - something they don't really look to be doing (sorry Tottenham fans). Despite reaching the final of the Carabao Cup and confirming their place in the last 16 of the Europa League, Spurs' dreams of a Premier League title tilt have long gone down the pan, and Jose Mourinho's side look to have a mountain to climb if they're even to secure a place in the top four this season. However, despite the club seemingly failing to hold up their end of the bargain in terms of making progress, The Telegraph report that they expect Kane to remain at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium beyond this summer. Daniel Levy has refused to set an asking price for his prized possession, remaining adamant that he wouldn't be forced into selling his star striker. Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain are two clubs who have regularly been linked with a move for Kane in recent times, but with the pair engaged in a tussle over the services of Kylian Mbappe, Spurs may be able to steer their frontman clear of any further transfer speculation.
