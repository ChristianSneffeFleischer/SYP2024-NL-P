Juventus midfielder Adrien Rabiot has admitted interest in a transfer to the Premier League, but insists he does not have a preferred club that he would like to join. Rabiot has had a fine World Cup with France and had also found some form at club level in the final few weeks before the Serie A calendar was put on hold. The 27-year-old, who briefly spent time in Manchester City   s academy, was the subject of interest from Manchester United during the summer transfer window prior to their capture of Casemiro. A transfer was agreed with Juventus, but there was no such concord with the player   s camp. Rabiot will soon enter the final six months of his Juventus contract, making him eligible to negotiate a pre-contract agreement with another club. His impressive World Cup campaign could also serve to drive up interest in the former Paris Saint-Germain talent.    Premier League attracts me. I've always said I'd like to play there - will it be at the end of my contract at Juve? I don't know,    the player told reporters this week.    I don't have favourite team in England, no team where I   d necessarily like to play.

Speaking earlier at the World Cup in November, Rabiot hadn   t ruled out a new contract with Juventus, although he acknowledged how his France form could bring suitors to his door.    If I   ll stay with Juve? I don   t know yet and it   s not the moment to talk about it,    he said.
