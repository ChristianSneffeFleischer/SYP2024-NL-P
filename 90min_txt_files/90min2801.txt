Bernardo Silva has admitted that while he is happy at Manchester City, he has 'no idea what's going to happen' in the future. 90min understands that Barcelona are intent on signing Silva this summer, though City have made it clear he is not for sale and have denied claims from the Catalan press that a deal has been agreed with the Blaugrana. Silva was similarly linked with a move away last year when Atletico Madrid showed an interest in him, and speaking to ESPN, the 28-year-old revealed he is content at the Etihad Stadium but could leave in future. "I've always said that I'm happy here, but I have no idea what's going to happen. We'll see, honestly," he said. "My relationship with the club is very honest. I've been open with them and they know what I want. If I stay, I'm very happy, and I will always respect this club and give all my best. If not, it's football and we'll just see what happens."

It was then pointed out to Silva that Gabriel Jesus and Raheem Sterling were both allowed to leave with little fuss already this window, and he insisted that City are always open to letting players go if they are unhappy.
