Jose Mourinho wants Tottenham Hotspur to sign Southampton star Jannik Vestergaard in the summer transfer window, as the Portuguese boss aims to bolster his defensive options for the coming season.  The Spurs coach has made a new centre-back his top priority for next year, after a stream of individual mistakes have cost his side dearly in important matches this campaign.  The Mirror reports that Vestergaard may be the answer to Mourinho's prayers, and he'll look to lure the Dane to north London in the summer, in an attempt to build a solid and uncompromising backline.  Vestergaard has been a consistent performer for Southampton this season, despite Saints' rocky form and occasional lows. He was sorely missed by Ralph Hasenhuttl in the winter period, and his absence through injury coincided with his side's drop from the upper echelons of the Premier League table.  The 28-year-old is entering the final year of his contract next season, and Spurs believe they could secure another bargain from the south coast club. Tottenham snatched Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg from Southampton in a cut-price deal last summer, and he has been a revelation in the midfield.  And they are hoping to pull off another coup this time round, to shore up their leaky defence. Mourinho placed all his faith in Eric Dier and Toby Alderweireld at the beginning of the season, but Dier has lost his spot in the side after a string of below-par performances.
