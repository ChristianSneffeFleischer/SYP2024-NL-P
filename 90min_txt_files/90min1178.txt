Brighton & Hove Albion are working to complete a deal to sign James Milner when his Liverpool contract expires this summer, 90min understands. The 37-year-old has remained an important rotation option for the Reds even late into his long career, with his first professional appearance coming over two decades ago. His deal at Anfield is up in the summer and 90min reported at the end of March that while Liverpool do intend to offer him a new one, it is not particularly high on their list of priorities. This has opened the door for other clubs to wrestle into the picture, and sources have told 90min that  Brighton believe they are close to securing an agreement with Milner. Nottingham Forest and boyhood club Leeds United would like him to wait until the end of the season to assess his options as they too are interested, while Liverpool's rivals Everton are in the same camp. Notably, all three clubs are in serious danger of relegation from the Premier League.
