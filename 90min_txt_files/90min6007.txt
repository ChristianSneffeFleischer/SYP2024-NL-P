West Ham are keen to shift Jack Wilshere's astronomical wages off the bill this summer, and are even prepared to pay a percentage of his salary at a new club in order to make it happen, according to a report.  Wilshere looked like an astute signing by the Irons following his release from Arsenal in 2018, but it has rapidly become apparent that the same circumstances which led to his Emirates departure have not subsided. In other words, he's been injured all the time.  The 28-year-old (because allegedly he is only 28) has made just 18 appearances for the east London club, but despite his omnipresent unavailability, he has taken home a staggering  £100,000 per week.over the past two seasons. A common theme in the replies.Just imagine how good Wilshere could have been without all the injuries! ? pic.twitter.com/i6JXiOeO3S His salary alone has cost the club  £20,000 for every minute of league football he has played.  Starting to see why they want him off the bill yet? Yeah. Wilshere's story has been one of the great tragedies of English football, as he is clearly an enormously talented midfielder, but his time as a top-level professional looks over. The Times report that West Ham are working on solutions to clear his wages off the bill, or at least cut them significantly, by negotiating his release from the club this summer.    Do it for you and not them ?

West Ham, it's thought, want to either buy out the final year of his deal, or aid his move to another club by offering to pay the difference in salary so that he continues to earn  £100,000 per week.
