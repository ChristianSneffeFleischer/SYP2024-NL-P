Leeds United have informed Wilfried Gnonto that he will not be sold, leading to his omission from the club's loss against Birmingham City on Saturday due to an internal disciplinary matter. The 19-year-old has been a subject of transfer interest this summer, with 90min revealing on Friday that Everton have had a bid rejected amid refusing to meet the  Â£30m asking price set by Leeds. Juventus and Napoli had earlier been interested in taking Gnonto back to Italy. Leeds are determined to keep Gnonto him as they hope to make a swift return to the Premier League, communicating to both the player and his representatives that he will not be available for a transfer.  Manager Daniel Farke confirmed Gnonto's unavailability and ahead of the Birmingham fixture, the club chose to issue a formal statement on the matter. feed "Earlier this week, Willy Gnonto and his representatives were informed by the club that he would not be sold this summer," it read. "Following those conversations, Willy felt he was unable to play in Wednesday night   s Carabao Cup tie with Shrewsbury Town. Despite training for the last two days, Willy has informed Daniel Farke that he still does not feel able to play this weekend and has not travelled to Birmingham for the game. This is now an internal disciplinary matter and the club will make no further comment, other than to reiterate that Willy Gnonto is not for sale." With Leeds making clear their stance, 90min understands that Everton have switched targets, albeit not very far. Instead, the Toffees are now keen on Gnonto's teammate Jack Harrison. Talks regarding a potential loan move to Goodison Park are underway.
