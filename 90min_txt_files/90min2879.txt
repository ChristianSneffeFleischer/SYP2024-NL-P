Wolves are in advanced talks with Chelsea to take Michy Batshuayi on loan for the 2022/23 season, 90min understands. Bruno Lage's men have made just two senior signings this summer - making Hwang Hee-chan's loan permanent and bringing in Nathan Collins from Burnley - and still have one of the Premier League's smallest squads. Their hopes for the new campaign were dealt a blow when Raul Jimenez picked up a MCL injury at the end of July. Wolves still have strikers Patrick Cutrone and Leo Bonatini on their books but they're unlikely be relied upon by Lage. Instead, 90min understands that they are looking to bring in Batshuayi from Chelsea on loan. The Belgium striker has a year left to run on his contract at Stamford Bridge, though the Blues have the option to extend his deal by a further 12 months. Wolves would pay a chunk of Batshuayi's wages should he head to Molineux. 90min previously reported of Everton's interest and they remain keen on Batshuayi, though Wolves have moved ahead of them in the queue. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  &  Sean Walsh  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Chelsea's plans to sign Marc Cucurella and Wesley Fofana. There's the latest on James Maddison, Jamie Vardy, Cristiano Ronaldo and Frenkie de Jong, and chat on Diogo Jota's new deal and Roberto Firmino's Liverpool future.
