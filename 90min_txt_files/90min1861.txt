Leeds United have upped their offer for Azzedine Ounahi as they look to win the race for the Moroccan World Cup star, sources have confirmed to 90min. The Whites are pushing hard to agree terms with Angers and want to follow on from their club-record signing of Georginio Rutter by landing the in-demand Ounahi. Sources have confirmed to 90min that the West Yorkshire side have offered    25m for Ounahi, which is not too far off Angers' asking price which is believed to be around    30m. However, a deal is far from complete. While Leeds' offer does meet Angers' demands - a rival Premier League offer Leicester City does not - it still falls short of the Ligue 1 club's main demand, which is to be allowed to keep the midfielder for the rest of the season.
