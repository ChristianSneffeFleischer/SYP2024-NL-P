Paris Saint-Germain have completed the signing of Valencia midfielder Carlos Soler on a five-year contract. The 25-year-old arrives in the French capital for a fee of around    18m, with the Ligue 1 champions expected to pay    3m in bonuses and add-ons. PSG have operated shrewdly during this summer's window, picking up the likes of Nordi Mukiele, Renato Sanches and Fabian Ruiz for just over    40m combined, while new sporting director Luis Campos has also overseen impressive deals for Vitinha and Hugo Ekitike. Soler is the seventh arrival for new manager Christoph Galtier, who has not only overseen an impressive start domestically, but is also working with Kylian Mbappe - who having turned down Real Madrid earlier in the summer is perhaps PSG's most impressive piece of business. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey,Toby Cudworth and Harry Symeou bring you a live deadline day edition of Talking Transfers. The team welcome Daniel Childs and Julien Laurens to the show to discuss Chelsea's late window activity, Arsenal's pursuit of Douglas Luiz, Paris Saint-Germain's summer signings & much more! The show is also available on all audio platforms. "I am very happy! It's a new adventure in my career, and I feel very proud and excited to start working with my teammates, meeting them and giving my all for this jersey," Soler told PSG's official website.
