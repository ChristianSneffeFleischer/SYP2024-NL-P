Barcelona vice-president Eduard Romeu is confident the club could find a way to bring Lionel Messi back if they wanted to. The club's financial problems forced Messi to somewhat reluctantly leave for PSG last year, but talk is growing that he could soon make a sensational return.

They wouldn't have to pay PSG anything given Messi's contract expires at the end of the season - the Argentine can opt in to one further year in Paris if he chooses - but providing him with a new one would cost a huge amount in itself.  Nevertheless, Romeu insists Barcelona are confident they could work something out and hand Messi a miraculous return to Camp Nou. "If the club want [to bring him back], we will get to work," he said in a press conference.  "We know how to make miracles happen. The door is always open for Messi."

It doesn't correspond to me.
