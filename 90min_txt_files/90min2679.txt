Ajax have held talks with Chelsea playmaker Hakim Ziyech, 90min understands, as they prepare to replace Antony, whose representatives are in direct contact with Manchester United. The Dutch giants are bracing themselves for United to return with an improved offer for Antony - having turned down a second bid of  £67.6m last week - and are looking to receive a club-record fee just shy of  £80m. 22-year-old Antony is desperate to reunite with former manager Erik ten Hag at United - he refused to attend training twice last week and was then left out of Alfred Schreuder's squad for the weekend win at Sparta Rotterdam - and has been left frustrated by Ajax's stance over a sale. 90min understands that the Eredivisie champions are expecting to receive a new offer, and sources have confirmed that United are already in talks with Antony and his representatives over a prospective move - and there's a belief that terms will be relatively easy to agree. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey,Toby Cudworth  and  Harry Symeou  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Antony attempting to push through a move to Man Utd, Frenkie de Jong and Pierre-Emerick Aubayemang's futures at Barcelona and Arsenal's interest in Pedro Neto.
