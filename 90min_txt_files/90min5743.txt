Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has held 'positive talks' with Georginio Wijnaldum over his future at the club.  The understated midfielder has been a key ingredient in the Reds' recent success, missing just one game last season as Klopp's side secured the Premier League title by a margin of 18 points. He also featured in the 2018 and 2019 Champions League finals. Wijnaldum has one year remaining on his Anfield deal and talks are yet to begin over the renewal of his contract. Barcelona have been sniffing around the former Newcastle man recently, who Blaugrana boss Ronald Koeman worked with during his time in charge of the Netherlands.  Klopp is keen for Wijnaldum to remain in Merseyside and according to Sky Sports, the pair held discussions over his future on Wednesday. The talks are understood to have been positive which could dent Bar  a's chances of landing the 29-year-old.  The news is the latest blow in what has been a disastrous summer for the Catalan giants. After surrendering the La Liga title to Cl  sico rivals Real Madrid, they were then thrashed 8-2 by Bayern Munich in the Champions League quarter finals.  It was one of the most humiliating results in the club's history and represented the culmination of years of mismanagement on and off the pitch. In the aftermath of this disaster, the vast majority of the playing squad was put up for sale, while Lionel Messi even expressed his desire to leave the club.
