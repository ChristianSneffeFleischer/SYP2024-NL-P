Bayern Munich have entered the race to sign Kim Min-jae and are in talks with his representatives over a deal, sources have told 90min. The South Korea defender cemented his status as one of the world's leading centre-backs with his performances for Napoli during their Serie A-winning campaign of 2022/23. In addition to the Scudetto, Kim also won the award for Serie A's Best Defender, following on from recent winners Kalidou Koulibaly, Stefen de Vrij, Cristian Romero and Gleison Bremer. 90min reported on Wednesday that Kim had turned down an offer of a new contract at Napoli which deal would have earned him a significant pay rise, but crucially would have also removed the release clause - something he is reluctant to do. The clause stipulates that Kim can leave Napoli during the first two weeks of July if an up-front offer if    50m comes in. Manchester United are known admirers of the 26-year-old, but sources have confirmed to 90min they have been joined in the running for Kim's signature by Bayern Munich. feed Kim's representatives had been hopeful of concluding a deal with Man Utd in the coming weeks, but Bayern have intimated that they are ready to trigger the    50m release clause once it becomes active in just over a fortnight. They are currently locked in talks with the player's camp over a transfer. In addition to United and Bayern, Newcastle United and Paris Saint-Germain have been monitoring Kim's situation. Kim is undergoing mandatory military service back in South Korea and is expected to return to Europe in July, by which point he could be on his way to a new club.
