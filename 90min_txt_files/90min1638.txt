Southampton's search for a new striker is over, with Nigerian striker Paul Onuachu putting pen to paper on a move to St Mary's Stadium until 2026. 28-year-old Onuachu, who stands at a whopping 6'7, is the top scorer in Belgian football this season with 16 goals in 19 games. The Nigeria international netted 29 league goals in the 2020/21 season and was on track to match that record before his move to St Mary's, which is understood to have cost the Saints a cool    20m. Speaking in a press release about the signing, manager Nathan Jones said:    Paul is a significant signing for us and completes what has been an extremely positive month in terms of recruitment.    He   s a handful to play against, has got a tremendous record throughout his career and he   s also someone who brings great experience with him, so he   ll be a really positive addition to the squad.
