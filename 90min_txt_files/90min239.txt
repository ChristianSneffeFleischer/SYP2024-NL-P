Bayern Munich want to step up their pursuit of Harry Kane and set up another meeting with Tottenham Hotspur chairman Daniel Levy, 90min understands. The Bundesliga champions have already seen two bids knocked back by Spurs for Kane, whose contract in north London expires in 2024. 90min recently reported that Tottenham are refusing to set an asking price for their star striker as they still retain confidence of securing his long-term future - Kane's representatives have not ruled out this possibility to the club. Levy met Bayern CEO Jan-Christian Dreesen earlier in July, though the Spurs chairman gave no indication or suggestion that Kane would be sold. Sources have confirmed to 90min that Dreesen and Bayern technical director Marco Neppe did not travel with the club for their pre-season tour of Asia as they would like to meet with Levy in person again in hope of thrashing out a deal for Kane. feed Levy, however, remains hopeful that head coach Ange Postecoglou's impact could yet persuade Kane to stay at Spurs. Bayern have floated the idea of attaching a player to their next bid, which is expected to be worth a club-record  Â£86m, and Benjamin Pavard may be on the table. However, there is little to suggest that this will entice Tottenham, who are continuing talks for alternate Bundesliga centre-backs in Edmond Tapsoba and Micky van de Ven. In an interview with Kicker, Bayern chairman Herbert Hainer - who is currently focusing his energies on trying to sign Kyle Walker from Manchester City - continued the club's public courting of Kane. "Here in the Bundesliga, we don't have many international stars any more," Hainer said. "Bayern always try to bring in stars. Harry Kane is a highly attractive player, the England captain and a top scorer. He would do us and the Bundesliga good."
