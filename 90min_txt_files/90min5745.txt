Chelsea have rejected an offer from Inter for N'Golo Kante that included Marcelo Brozovic as makeweight - and the Blues are also not interested in any deal involving Christian Eriksen.  Kante's 2019/2020 campaign was hampered by injury with the Frenchman being restricted to just 22 Premier League appearances. Last season aside, the 29-year-old has been consistently world class since arriving at Stamford Bridge in the summer of 2016.  Throughout the summer Kante was linked with a move away from the Blues with Inter strongly interested in the tireless midfield. According to the Guardian, the Nerazzurri finally made a ploy for Kante's services recently.  It is reported that Inter touted Marcelo Brozovic to Chelsea in a part exchange deal but the offer was turned down. The Serie A side also have suggested including Eriksen in negotiations, but again this idea was dismissed.  Frank Lampard is keen for Kante to remain a part of his squad and the Frenchman is more than happy to remain at the club for the time being.  Inter have already had an active transfer window and manager Antonio Conte - who won a Premier League title with Kante during the 2016/2017 campaign - would need to sell some players to finance a straight cash deal.
