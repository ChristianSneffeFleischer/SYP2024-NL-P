Inter chairman Steven Zhang has insisted the club don't have the financial might to compete for Lionel Messi and did not consider signing the Barcelona captain this summer, despite reports to the contrary. The Italian side have been loosely linked with a move for Messi over the past few years, but pipe dream briefly became a realistic prospect in August when the player informed Bar  a he wanted to leave. Inter were considered one of the primary potential destinations, with only Manchester City, and Pep Guardiola, thought to be ahead of them in the running.  The finances involved in a potential move to City were absurd, however. One report claimed the 33-year-old would be raking in close to  Â£1m per week in Manchester, which, coupled with a transfer fee and nose-bleeding bonuses, adds up to a lot of money. So much money, in fact, that Zhang claims Inter simply could not afford to really enter the running.

Innovation, planning, constant growth, economic stability are our cornerstones.      Following this path, which involves planning in the long term, we will arrive at the desired results and goals, we will bring Inter back to the national and international level.    Inter have spent cautiously this summer, with Achraf Hakimi and Aleksandar Kolarov their only high-profile new arrivals. The loans of Stefano Sensi and Nicolo Barella were made permanent, but the vast majority of their incoming business has been offset by player sales. Lionel Messi. Stop it. pic.twitter.com/6beJuhwYyk
