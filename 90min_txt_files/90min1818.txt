Arnaut Danjuma has agreed to join Everton and is set to arrive on loan for the rest of the season, sources have confirmed to 90min. The 25-year-old has been looking for a move for much of this month and was given permission by Villarreal to travel to England for talks. Aston Villa, Southampton, Nottingham Forest and Leicester all showed interest, but in the end it was a choice of three for Danjuma. He could have returned to former clubs Bournemouth or PSV Eindhoven, but instead he has decided to take on the relegation battle at Goodison Park. Danjuma will join on loan with an option to make the move permanent subject to finalising a medical, which is booked in.

This week's agenda includes Jude Bellingham, Harry Kane, Declan Rice, Hakim Ziyech, Leandro Trossard, Pedro Porro, Mykhaylo Mudryk and more!
