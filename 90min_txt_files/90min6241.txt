West Ham have shown an interest in bringing Atalanta defender Robin Gosens to the club this summer, but could face a battle with other clubs for his signature. Gosens - who plays as a left back - has scored an impressive ten goals in all competition this season and assisted a further eight, which has understandably put his name on the lips of a number of clubs. The Irons are one of the clubs said to be interested in his services, with David Moyes keen on signing Gosens this summer, according to Tutto Mercato Web. Moyes would likely have to sell a number of players before he can move for the 26-year-old, however, meaning that a number of big names could move on this summer. Even if West Ham do raise the funds to move for Gosens, they face competition from a number of sides. Chelsea are said to be considering a move for the German in their bid for a new left back, but have also been linked with Ben Chilwell and Nicolas Tagliafico. The report from Italy does reaffirm Chelsea's interest, however, and also states that Leicester are tempted by a move for Gosens, which could make life even harder for West Ham. If the Foxes do target the German, it could well be as a replacement for Chilwell.
