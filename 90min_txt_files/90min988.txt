Left-back Fran Garcia has admitted he is looking forward to his chance to establish himself at boyhood club Real Madrid as he prepares to join up with Los Blancos this summer. The 23-year-old came through Real's academy before a loan to Rayo Vallecano in 2020 turned into a permanent transfer, but he has enjoyed an excellent three years away from Madrid and Blancos boss Carlo Ancelotti has already confirmed Garcia will return to the club this summer. Paying his respects to Rayo in an interview to AS, Garcia acknowledged everything he has done so far in his career has been with a view to earning a chance at the Santiago Bernabeu. "I've never hidden it," he said. "I am a clear and sincere person. I came to show that I'm ready and that I can take that step that every Madrid youth player goes looking for. The work is there. The numbers also reflect it. "Luckily, I have had the opportunity for Madrid to count on me. You have to keep working." feed Having previously been discarded by Real, Garcia admitted he is determined to convince everyone at the Bernabeu of his value to the team. "I have more desire and enthusiasm than anything else," Garcia insisted. "I have been improving these three years and now it is about dispelling those doubts that may exist. I am young and I have to keep learning every day." On what he will bring to Real's first team, Garcia added: "I am a player who gives 100% all the time. I have a lot of energy and power. That is one of the virtues that I should try take advantage of, that's my idea. "I will do what I have done so far and what has led me back there. I want to take this chance."
