Valencia would be interested in signing Kepa Arrizabalaga on an initial loan deal after being 'offered' the goalkeeper by Chelsea, claims one report from Spain. Kepa has been, well, not great this season. After a mixed first term with the Blues, his performances have been inconsistent in 2019/20 to the point where he even (temporarily) lost his place in the side to 38-year-old Willy Caballero.  Glad to be back! +3 points with an important message: #blacklivesmatter ??? @chelseafc A post shared by  Kepa Arrizabalaga Revuelta (@kepaarrizabalaga) on Jun 21, 2020 at 11:36am PDT A number of high-profile errors were behind Frank Lampard's decision, but while he's managed to earn back his place in the starting lineup, huge question remarks still remain over his suitability to the number one spot in the long-term. That could even be in the short-term too, as Marca claim that Valencia are mulling over a deal to bring the Spaniard back to his homeland. It's claimed that any deal would likely by a two-year loan move, which includes a buying option, although it doesn't specify whether this is an option to buy or an obligation. It's also added that this is something Chelsea are keen on, as they offered their stopper out to Valencia in a desperate bid to make some return on their hefty near- Â£72m investment. A plethora of goalkeepers have been linked with a move to Chelsea as far back as December, ranging from Andre Onana of Ajax to Aaron Ramsdale of Bournemouth. Should the Blues move for Onana, then it could spark a merry-go-round of sorts in the goalkeeper department.
