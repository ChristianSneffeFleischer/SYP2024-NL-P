Leicester have confirmed the capture of AS Saint-Etienne defender Wesley Fofana on a five-year deal. Brendan Rodgers has made central defence one of his key areas to strengthen this window, with bids rejected by Burnley for James Tarkowski, among others. Leicester City is delighted to confirm the signing of defender @Wesley_Fofanaa from Ligue 1 side AS Saint-  tienne for an undisclosed fee, subject to Premier League and international clearance ??#WelcomeWesley Their latest addition comes in the form of highly-rated 19-year-old Fofana, who has featured 29 times in all competitions for Les Verts. Speaking on the club's official website, Fofana said:    I   m very happy to be here. I   ve watched Leicester City closely since they won the title and they   re a top club in the Premier League. I know I will learn a lot from the players and the manager here, which is one of the main reasons I came. I can   t wait to get started.    Rodgers previously spoke about a necessity to strengthen that area, one coming about following the lengthy injury sustained to Wilfred Ndidi, as well as concern regarding Wes Morgan's ability to play regular Premier League football. "There's a number of players associated with ourselves and it's clear that centre-back is a position where we're looking to bring someone in. We'll see what the club can do and we'll take it from there," Rodgers said. Now having secured their man - for a fee rumoured to be somewhere between  £30m- £40m - the Foxes can turn their attention towards maintaining their 100% start to the Premier League season.
