Jordan Henderson has completed a medical with Saudi Pro League side Al Ettifaq ahead of his  £12m move from Liverpool. The England international has been pursued as a top target since Steven Gerrard's arrival in Dammam and a fee was recently agreed, signalling the end of Henderson's 12-year stay at Anfield. 90min understands only the finer details are left to be completed before the 33-year-old relocates permanently to the Middle East. He is due to link up with Gerrard's squad at their pre-season camp in Croatia. Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai have arrived on Merseyside with Liverpool's midfield rebuild forced into a quicker transition. However, Henderson is not the only senior midfielder departing. Brazilian Fabinho was recently granted permission to go for a medical with Saudi Pro League champions Al Ittihad, who have also added Karim Benzema and N'Golo Kante to their ranks this summer. 90min understands the defensive midfielder is now en route to Al Ittihad having already passed a medical. Final payment details over the  £40m transfer - one of the biggest deals the Public Investment Fund (PIF) and the Pro League have agreed to - have also been smoothed out. Contemplating the loss of two established first team squad members, manager Jurgen Klopp says he is confident Liverpool will have a competitive team for the start of next season. "My main focus and my main energy has to go into the training sessions, that's what I do," he told Liverpool's official club podcast. "The time left and right of the sessions then I can try and sort other stuff, and that's what we are doing. "Still around three to four weeks until the first game of the season, a few things have to happen until then. Definitely. Transfer market-wise as well, that's clear now. "It will happen, and we will have a good team."
