Exclusive - Multiple MLS clubs are showing interest in Israel national team vice-captain Eli Dasa, 90min understands. The 29-year-old right-back is a free agent after his contract with Eredivisie side Vitesse expired at the end of the 2021/22 season, bringing a three-year stay at the GelreDome to an end. Dasa provided five assists in 33 Eredivisie appearances last season and is best known for attacking qualities in the final third. Sources with knowledge of the situation have told 90min that at least two MLS clubs have been considering making offers for Dasa, while a number of others remain interested. A versatile defender, Dasa would fit into a back four or as a wing-back - a role he's often filled across his 48 caps for Israel.
