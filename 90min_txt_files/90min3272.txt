Nayef Aguerd has confirmed in a post on social media that he is leaving Rennes, with West Ham expected to announce his signing in the coming days. 90min confirmed on Thursday that Aguerd would undergo the second part of a medical in London on Friday, after terms were agreed with Rennes over a move that could be worth as much as  Â£30m plus add-ons. Aguerd has been away on international duty with Morocco for the past couple of weeks, which had seen negotiations draw out a little longer than many would have liked, but in a post circulated on his official Twitter account, the 26-year-old has confirmed he is leaving Rennes for pastures new - posting a fond farewell to the club's staff and supporters. "It is with great emotion that I announce that I played my last  match under the colours [against] of Lille," Aguerd wrote.
