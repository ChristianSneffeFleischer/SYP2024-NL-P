Bernardo Silva has stressed his commitment to Manchester City this year but has left the door open for a move away in the summer. The Portugal international was keen to leave the club during the summer, with Barcelona keen to get a deal done, but the cost of any potential transfer was far too much for the Catalan side after their hectic summer. 90min understands that Barcelona have made it clear to Silva that they plan to reignite their interest in 2023, with sources confirming that the Blaugrana are keen to get a deal done as soon as possible - perhaps even in January. Asked about both his short-term and long-term plans, Silva insisted he is focused on succeeding with City this season but refused to guarantee things would be the same next year.    I have both eyes on winning the Premier League and trying to win the Champions League, Carabao and FA Cup,    he said.    At the end of the season we'll see what happens, but right now I   m going to give my best for the club and will give my best as long as I play here.    Scott Saunders  hosts  Graeme Bailey  and  Toby Cudworth  in the latest episode of Talking Transfers. The team discuss Chelsea's search for a new striker, the growing interest in Napoli rising star Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, Newcastle's plans for Bruno Guimaraes and more.
