Midfielder Saphir Taider has stated his desire to return for a second spell with CF Montreal. The Algeria international previously enjoyed a productive stay with the Canadian club between 2018 and 2020, grabbing 22 goals and 22 assists in 86 appearances across all competitions.  He's since been playing in Saudi Arabia for Al Ain FC but left the club after just seven games due to reported payment issues.  Speaking to Jean-Fran  ois T  otonio of La Presse about his future, Taider named a return to Montreal as his preferred next move due to family reasons. "I would favor Montr  al over all the other offers I can have because my family feels so good there, and me too," he said (via MLSsoccer.com). "When you have a family, you really prioritize the family aspect more than anything else." Aside from his previous success in MLS with Montreal, Taider also has playing experience with Serie A giants Inter Milan, as well as the likes of Sassuolo, Bologna, and French side Grenoble.  Still only 29, it's unclear whether or not Taider would demand a Designated Player (DP) contract as he did during his previous spell. The only existing DP on Montreal's roster is Kenyan midfielder, Victor Wanyama. OH MY GOODNESS!

During his debut campaign in the dugout, the Frenchman led his side to 10th in the Eastern Conference, but only missed out on the Playoffs on the final day of the regular season.
