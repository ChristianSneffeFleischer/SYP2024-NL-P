Leicester and Real Betis have reached an agreement for the transfer of holding midfielder William Carvalho, according to a new report in Spain. The 28-year-old defensive midfielder joined Betis from Sporting CP in 2018, moving to La Liga after cancelling his contract in his native Portugal following an attack on the club's training ground from frustrated supporters.  Depois de 4 meses parado devido a uma les £o nada melhor que voltar a fazer o que mais gostas e com boas sensa    es ?? o resultado n £o foi o mais desejado de todo mas agora    trabalhar para que no pr  ximo jogo tenhamos os 3pontos! Obrigado a Todos!       ?? A post shared by  William Carvalho (@wcarvalho14) on Feb 10, 2020 at 12:59am PST To date, he's made 43 appearances in La Liga, and has already courted interest from the Premier League in the past year or so. Now, according to local publication Estadio Deportivo, Carvalho 'will sign' on the dotted line at King Power Stadium this summer, leaving Spain after just two seasons. Estadio's report suggests that Carvalho will cost the Foxes around  £22.5m, with 25% of the fee going to his former club as part of a prior agreement. Were he to join, Carvalho would add valuable experience to Leicester's dressing room, having been part of Portugal's glorious European Championship campaign in 2016.  The Foxes would welcome his know-how of winning at the highest level, with the club's fledgling Champions League qualification hopes in danger of falling by the wayside unless they can turn things around before the end of the season. Recent performances have suggested that further depth to their squad is required, and the burden on Wilfred Ndidi to hold things together in midfield was abundantly clear when he was out of action for a number of matches.
