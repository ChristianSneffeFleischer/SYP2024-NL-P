Manchester United midfielder Andreas Pereira has flown to Rome to complete his medical, ahead of his loan move to Lazio.  The 24-year-old has struggled for first team football of late, starting just two Premier League games since the coronavirus enforced shutdown. Overall, the Brazilian has made 75 appearances for United in all competitions, scoring just four goals.   In a bid to resurrect his stuttering career, Perreira is set to go out on loan to Lazio with the Daily Mail reporting that he flew out to Italy for his medical on Wednesday afternoon. Earlier that day, he said his farewells to his teammates as the Red Devils' Carrington training ground.  It is uncertain if Perreira will play for United again. Although, the Belgium born playmaker has three years left to run on his Old Trafford contract, his loan deal does include an option to buy clause worth  Â£24.5m.  Perreira had been eager to remain with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's squad this season. However, with Donny van de Beek's arrival from Ajax further increasing competition for places, he has instead decided to try his luck in Serie A. Lazio will be hoping he helps them to again mount a serious title challenge. The Eagles finished just five points behind champions Juventus last season and have already strengthen with the arrivals Verdat Muriqi and Pepe Reina.
