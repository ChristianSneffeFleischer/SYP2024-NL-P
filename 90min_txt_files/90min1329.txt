Chelsea head coach Graham Potter has refused to rule out the reintegration of Romelu Lukaku next season once his loan at Inter expires. After rejoining the Blues from the Nerazzurri for a then-club record fee in the summer of 2021, the Belgian was unable to hit the heights back at Stamford Bridge. Lukaku returned to Inter on loan for the 2022/23 season, and 90min understands the Serie A side will look to take him on for another year but on reduced terms. However, Potter has opened the door to Lukaku having another crack at Chelsea next season. "Although he is our player, he is on loan and an Inter Milan player. I think it is important he finishes that off. Then we have a decision to make in the summer," Potter said at a press conference on Friday. "He is someone I admire a lot, I like a lot but again it is something to think about over the summer." Lukaku has spent the current season battling various injury and fitness woes, missing much of Inter's campaign so far. He looked notably out of sorts at the 2022 FIFA World Cup with Belgium as the Red Devils were eliminated at the group stage. However, Lukaku has started to pick up form again, scoring a hat-trick against Sweden and once against Germany over the recent international window. Lukaku's Inter are also through to the quarter-finals of the UEFA Champions League where they will face Benfica. The winners will take on either AC Milan or Napoli in the semi-finals.
