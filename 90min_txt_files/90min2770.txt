Wolves manager Bruno Lage has revealed the club are doing everything possible to tie midfielder Ruben Neves down to a new contract. The 25-year-old has entered the final two years of his contract and is known to harbour ambitions of playing in the Champions League, with suitors like Barcelona and Manchester United both rumoured to be keen on offering Neves greater access to European football. Amid all the uncertainty surrounding Neves' future, Lage has reassured fans that Wolves are working tirelessly to keep hold of their midfield star. "We're working on that," he said. "One thing for the fans, in the last game I was in the press conference but it was so clear for me, what the fans were singing to keep Ruben. We are doing everything that we have in our hands to keep Ruben. "He's been very good [professionally]. It is one of the things about Ruben that   s a good example that shows the relationship between the manager and a player. It   s easy to work with him, he understands a lot of things, not just about him but about the team. "He's a great professional and he wants to learn and improve. Every challenge I give to him, we talk through the season, he works for that. I feel proud for him for what he did in the last year and I   m so happy that he stays with us.
