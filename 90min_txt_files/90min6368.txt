Juventus are plotting a move for Atalanta wing-back Robin Gosens this summer as Maurizio Sarri attempts to bolster his options ahead of next season. Gosens will be on full view for the Bianconeri at the weekend as a red-hot Atalanta travel to Turin to take on Sarri's table-toppers at the Allianz Stadium. Corriere di Torino (via Football Italia) understand that Juve will be keeping a close eye on the German during the contest, with La Dea having the chance to cut the Bianconeri's lead at the top of Serie A to six points with a victory on Saturday night. The Old Lady are said to be huge admirers of Gosens, but they could face competition from Inter for the 26-year-old's signature this summer.  The German, who's starred in an aggressive wing-back role under Gian Piero Gasperini this term, seems like an ideal fit for Antonio Conte's system. He's scored nine times in Serie A this season - adding a further six assists - and his profile resembles that of Marcos Alonso's -  a player who Conte got the very best out of during his stint as Chelsea boss.  Nevertheless, Juve are keen to bring in at least one full-back this summer, with Mattia De Sciglio   s future uncertain and Juan Cuadrado the wrong side of 30.  And although Luca Pellegrini has the capacity to provide healthy competition for current favoured left-back Alex Sandro when he returns from his Cagliari loan, Gosens has the potential to evolve into the Bianconeri's long-term option at that position if he's able to excel as part of a back four.
