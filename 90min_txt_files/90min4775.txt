The agent of Watford winger Ismaila Sarr has claimed a January transfer to Liverpool fell through at the eleventh hour over financial issues. 22-year-old Sarr has long tipped for a move back to the Premier League ever since Watford were relegated at the end of the 2019/20 season. The Senegal star scored five times and registered four assists in his maiden campaign in England's top flight, with his pace and trickery catching the eye despite the Hornets' struggles. Two of his five Premier League goals came in the shock 3-0 win over Liverpool back in February, while the 2019/20 champions were clearly impressed with what they witnessed. Many reports since have asserted that Sarr is on the Anfield club's list of transfer targets. While the Reds ultimately signed Diogo Jota over Sarr during the summer, the Watford star's agent Thierno Seydi has claimed Liverpool actually returned to make an offer for his client 'in the last few days' - presumably, referencing the January transfer window. Speaking to Panafricanfootball.com, Seydi claimed that talks were so advanced over a    40m ( Â£35m) deal that he even asked countryman and friend Sadio Mane to help find Sarr a place to live.    Take care of my boy.   Sadio Man   had a message for @T_Deeney after today's game...#LIVWAT @izosarr ?? pic.twitter.com/xyLN2bLER7    With Liverpool, a few days ago, we were at the stage of signing the contract to bind the Reds to Isma  la Sarr," Seydi is quoted as saying. "Everything was set, the monthly salary and the length of the contract.  I even asked Sadio Man   to find him an apartment.  But in the end, the English club could not put    40m on the table to finalise this deal."
