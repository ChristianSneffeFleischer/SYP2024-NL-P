Lionel Messi remains determined to return to former club Barcelona this summer after his relationship with Paris Saint-Germain hit a new low, 90min understands. Messi's contract in Paris expires in the summer and although he has been offered the chance to extend his deal, those in charge at PSG have long accepted that the Argentine will walk away at the end of the current season. Since then, Messi has attracted the frustration of his employers with an unauthorised trip to Saudi Arabia, which has seen him suspended by the club. Such is the condition of Messi's current relationship with PSG that 90min understands the idea of the Argentine never playing for PSG again has not been ruled out. Right at the top of Messi's list of preferred destinations is Camp Nou and Barcelona are working tirelessly to try and work out a way to bring the 35-year-old back on a deal which will not fall foul of La Liga's financial rules, which were the reason he left in the first place. feed Barcelona president Joan Laporta sees Messi's potential return as a priority for this summer but there is plenty of work to do and no guarantees it will be possible. Messi has received a rival bid from Saudi Arabia which would make him the highest paid player in history. The World Cup winner is already an ambassador for the country, has long been identified as a dream signing there, and the proposal is under consideration. Another viable option is a move to Major League Soccer with Inter Miami, although it is understood that Messi would prefer a move to America later in his career. Despite suggestions of interest from the Premier League, sources close to Messi insist no offers have arrived from England.
