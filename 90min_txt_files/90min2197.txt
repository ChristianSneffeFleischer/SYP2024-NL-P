Cody Gakpo has revealed what he thinks about speculation over his club future during the 2022 World Cup. The Dutchman has enjoyed a sparkling tournament so far and his stock continues to grow thanks to three goals in the group stages. He also performed impressively in the last 16 clash against the United States, where Louis van Gaal's side won 3-1 to reach the quarter-finals. The World Cup's main breakout star so far, Gakpo still plays for PSV Eindhoven but attracted interest from Leeds over the summer - Whites boss Jesse Marsch recently revealed just how close a deal was. Manchester United have been further convinced of his quality by his performances so far, 90min understands, and manager Erik ten Hag is pushing the club to make the signing. However, when asked about his future at club level, the 23-year-old gave a coy response.    I have to be honest, I am not thinking about that now,    he told  The Athletic.    I am focused on the tournament and want to keep performing well, to keep helping the team. Hopefully when we become world champions we can think about other things.    I try to keep focused and the other players don   t really speak about that kind of thing.
