Fulham have confirmed the signing of midfielder Sasa Lukic from Torino on a four-and-a-half year deal.  The 26-year-old joins Fulham after a successful six-and-a-half year stint in Serie A in which he made 162 appearances for the Granata.  Speaking to the club's official website after completing the move, Lukic said: I   m very happy to have signed, and to now be a part of Fulham   s squad.    I can   t wait to get started and meet with the Head Coach, the players, and the staff, and I   m looking forward to training with them when I arrive in England.    I   ve seen Fulham play this season and they   ve been playing very well. They have a good squad, with a great history.    A lot of great players have played for the Club in its history, and they have a lot of great players currently, like my compatriot Aleksandar Mitrovi  .
