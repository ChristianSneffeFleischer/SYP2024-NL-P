Tottenham are keen to pursue a deal for Brighton right-back Tariq Lamptey this summer. The youngster made an impressive start to the 2020/21 season - notching three assists and one goal in his opening seven Premier League outings - though his progress was thwarted after picking up a hamstring injury in December. Lamptey had been expected to return before the end of the season, but numerous setbacks in his recovery saw him unable to feature for Brighton for the remainder of the campaign. Despite not featuring for the Seagulls for six months and having only made 19 Premier League appearance in his whole career, Sky Sports report that Spurs have seen enough to want to sign the 20-year-old. While Tottenham's interest in the talented youngster will probably come as no surprise, the timing of their pursuit is particularly odd given they're currently without a manager. Former Roma boss Paulo Fonseca is widely expected to be named as the new man at the helm in the coming days, though with Fabio Paratici already announced as managing director at the north London club, it seems as though the former Juventus director of football may be calling the shots with regards to the club's transfer business.
