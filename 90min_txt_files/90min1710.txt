Inter centre-back Milan Skriniar has confirmed he has reached an agreement to join Paris Saint-Germain on a free transfer in the summer. The 27-year-old is in the final six months of his contract in Spain and has turned down the offer of an extension in favour of joining PSG, who came close to signing Skriniar in a traditional transfer before the season began. Since then, PSG have remained in contract with Skriniar and have won the race to sign him as a free agent, fending off interest from a number of Premier League clubs in the process. Asked by futbolsfz to confirm whether he had signed a contract with PSG, Skriniar simply said: "Yes, that's right, but I can't say more about it at the moment." PSG are now working to try and convince Inter to part ways with the centre-back before the closure of the current transfer window, but the Serie A side are reluctant to lose a key defender midway through the season. "I am waiting for an agreement between the two clubs," Skriniar confirmed. Listen now as  Scott Saunders  hosts  Graeme Bailey  and  Toby Cudworth  to discuss the latest transfer news.
