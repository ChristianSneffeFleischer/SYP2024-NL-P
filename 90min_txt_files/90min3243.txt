The 2021/22 season is finally over, and we're already in the middle of the next part of this godforsaken never-ending cycle - the summer transfer window. Some clubs need to sell deadwood to make room for new players. Some players need to move on to take a step up. Sometimes both parties just need a fresh start. Here are 20 players who could do with with a transfer this window. Current club: Manchester UnitedLinked clubs: None, which is a bit of a problemWhy does he need a transfer? United's role for 'underperforming forward' is overstaffedAnthony Martial found the back of the net 23 times and won Man Utd's Players' Player of the Year award in 2019/20. Since then, he's scored just a further nine times.It's time to move on, Tony. Current club: ChelseaLinked clubs: Juventus, Bayern Munich, Borussia DortmundWhy does he need a transfer? It's not good when a misfiring striker admits the fans shouldn't like himWhile Timo Werner has come up with some moments of inspiration for Chelsea, they've not been consistent enough and he's become famous for his sitters and gaffs more than his goals.His Bundesliga record was impeccable, but with Thomas Tuchel looking to completely remould his forward line, Werner has to move on. Current club: ArsenalLinked clubs: Milan, PSGWhy does he need a transfer? We're still looking for his good performances for ArsenalIn hindsight, maybe Arsenal spending a club-record  Â£72m on a winger who scored 22 goals in a Ligue 1 season when half of them were penalties wasn't a stroke of genius.The Gunners' aggressive pursuit of Raphinha when they already have Bukayo Saka too is a clear indication that Nicolas Pepe doesn't have a future at the Emirates Stadium. Current club: TottenhamLinked clubs: Everton, Leicester, Crystal PalaceWhy does he need a transfer? Why doesn't he need a transfer?Injuries, a loss of confidence and just generally better players being ahead of him in the pecking order have all but ended Harry Winks' Spurs career.He needs a fresh start, but luckily for the 10-time England international, there are plenty of clubs interested in helping him revive his career. Current club: LiverpoolLinked clubs: Aston Villa, Crystal PalaceWhy does he need a transfer? Name one thing he did last seasonBy all accounts, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has at least been useful to Liverpool since his move from Arsenal.Injuries have seriously disrupted his progress but his highlight reel at Anfield still packs a punch, but now he can barely even get into their matchday squads even when he's fit. Current club: JuventusLinked clubs: Manchester United, Arsenal, TottenhamWhy does he need a transfer? 90min's resident Juventus fan Jack Gallagher might spontaneously combust if he doesn't leaveHere at 90min, we cover Juventus matches quite a bit. More often than not, Adrien Rabiot has a game so bad that he doesn't even get a grade in our player ratings, only a 'N/A'. Current club: Manchester CityLinked clubs: Everton, ArsenalWhy does he need a transfer? Obviously too good to just be a backup left-backOnly Pep Guardiola could get away with playing a clearly talented technical midfielder at left-back.Oleksandr Zinchenko has scooped up numerous titles as a useful player for an all-conquering team, but the time has come to become a star in his own right. Current club: LeicesterLinked clubs: ArsenalWhy does he need a transfer? To fulfil his FM destinyAfter all the talk of Leicester replacing Arsenal in the Premier League's 'big six', the Gunners came roaring back last season. It's only fair that the Foxes fork over Youri Tielemans as further reward. Current club: WolvesLinked clubs: Tottenham, Leeds, NewcastleWhy does he need a transfer? If anything, he suits Wolves' low-scoring approach too muchBarcelona opted not to make Adama Traore's loan move permanent, meaning that we're just going to have to find some other club to unleash his true potential - coming off the bench to scare the s*** out of teams that play fatally high lines only to misplace the resulting pass, cross or shot. Current club: Real MadridLinked clubs: Liverpool. PSG, MilanWhy does he need a transfer? If this isn't the time for a fresh start then there'll never be oneMarco Asensio has won everything there is to win in a Real Madrid shirt a few times over without ever being anything more than decent. It would be nice to see how he fared in a more prominent role in different surroundings. Current club: JuventusLinked clubs: Arsenal, PSGWhy does he need a transfer? He might be the world's most famous player that you wouldn't recognise if he walked past you in the streetI was astounded to learn Arthur was in fact 25 and not 28 when researching this article.You still have some peak years left, buddy. Stop wasting them in Juventus' awful midfield rotation. Current club: PSGLinked clubs: BenficaWhy does he need a transfer? Gianluigi Donnarumma existsAt the very least, Keylor Navas is still a good goalkeeper. He certainly wouldn't have made the same error as Donnarumma in March's loss to Real Madrid.Unfortunately, Donnarumma is PSG's future between the sticks. But the Costa Rican definitely has enough left in him to start for another quality side. Current club: PSGLinked clubs: Tottenham, Everton, ArsenalWhy does he need a transfer? He needs a do-over of his decision last summerWhile Navas is too good for his role at PSG, Georginio Wijnaldum has outright failed in his own.That's not necessarily all his fault, but it's now blindingly obvious he's not a good fit for a team that is already carrying at least two passengers up front. Wijnaldum's ball-shy goal-hanging approach is redundant in the French capital. Current club: BarcelonaLinked clubs: Girona, LyonWhy does he need a transfer? What do you mean he's still at Barcelona?Apparently Samuel Umtiti has played over 130 times for Barcelona, including once last season. Maybe someone working in football databases has been moving decimal points about.Anyway, he's still just 28 (!!!) and it'd be nice to see him on a football pitch again. Current club: EvertonLinked clubs: West HamWhy does he need a transfer? Everton will soon have James Tarkowski to play the Michael Keane roleEverton signing Michael Keane from Burnley at the time looked like an ok bit of business at the time, even if it was a marginal overpay.They'll be hoping James Tarkowski won't be anywhere near as horrendous a signing, which will be tough considering he arrived on a free but never underestimate Everton's power.Oh, and Keane should probably leave as a result. Current club: JuventusLinked clubs: Cardiff CityWhy does he need a transfer? Wales' hopes and dreams depend on itThe likelihood is that Aaron Ramsey will probably head to the 2022 World Cup unfit and/or injured. He can make it so that he may only be injured with a transfer away from Juventus. Current club: WolvesLinked clubs: Arsenal, Barcelona, Manchester UnitedWhy does he need a transfer? Wolves aren't exactly building an amazing team around himIt was a shock when Ruben Neves, then only 20 and already one of Europe's top young prospects, decided to leave Porto to sign for Championship side Wolves in 2017. It's a shock that he's still hanging around at Molineux when he obviously has the quality to start for much, much better sides.Several top clubs are on the hunt for a midfielder who can help control possession and Neves should be near the top of those lists. Current club: Aston VillaLinked clubs: Arsenal, RomaWhy does he need a transfer? Steven Gerrard has a shiny new toy in Boubacar KamaraSee the second paragraph we used for Neves? Apply that too Douglas Luiz, but take the level of the club down a little. A lot of teams of Aston Villa's class need a player like him as a starter as opposed to a rotation option.
