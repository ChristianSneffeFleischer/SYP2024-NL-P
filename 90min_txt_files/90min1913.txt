Leicester City have made a  Â£30m offer to Fiorentina for versatile forward Nicolas Gonzalez, sources have told 90min. The Foxes are searching for reinforcements to help kickstart what has been a rather dismal 2022/23 season so far. 90min understands that they are in talks with Fiorentina over a potential move for Gonzalez. Leicester believe that the Argentina international is keen on a move to the King Power Stadium and are now waiting for La Viola to accept their offer in order to complete a deal. Fiorentina are tempted by Leicester's offer, though the Foxes are not the only other Premier League side monitoring Gonzalez. Tottenham and Newcastle have made their interest known in recent months, but have not yet made a firm offer for the 24-year-old. Gonzalez has scored five goals in 11 games for Fiorentina this season, primarily playing from the right wing. He joined the Italian side from Stuttgart back in 2021. After missing part of this season through injury, Gonzalez was cut from Argentina's final 26-player squad for their successful 2022 World Cup campaign.
