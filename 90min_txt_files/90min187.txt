Arsenal have spoken with the representatives of Brentford goalkeeper David Raya over a summer switch to the Emirates, 90min understands. Raya has entered the final 12 months of his contract at the Brentford Community Stadium and has made it clear he is keen to move on this summer, with clubs from across Europe expressing an interest in his services. A number of Premier League sides have looked at Raya, while German giants Bayern Munich are also keen on the Spain international. Arsenal, who wanted Raya before they struck a deal to sign Aaron Ramsdale in the summer of 2021, have now re-joined the race for the 27-year-old. Sources have confirmed to 90min that Arsenal are looking to sign another high-level goalkeeper to provide more competition for Ramsdale and Raya is happy to enter into a battle for a starting spot - a message he also conveyed to Manchester United when the Red Devils enquired earlier this year. feed Brentford have publicly valued Raya at  Â£40m and continue to stand firm on that price tag, which already derailed talks with Tottenham and has scared off numerous other suitors. Arsenal are also reluctant to pay such a high fee for a player entering the final year of a contract and, as such, have also enquired about Brighton goalkeeper Robert Sanchez as a possible alternative. Chelsea are also interested in Sanchez, another Spain international. The Gunners are prepared to allow current backup Matt Turner to leave this summer, with a loan exit a possibility at this point. Interest in Turner has comefrom Nottingham Forest, who are exploring their options amid their own concerns over the asking price of Manchester United's Dean Henderson.
