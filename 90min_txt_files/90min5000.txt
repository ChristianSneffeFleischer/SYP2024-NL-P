Andrea Pirlo is understood to be keeping tabs on Sampdoria striker Fabio Quagliarella as he looks to bolster his attacking options, though the veteran goalscorer isn't the only frontman on Juventus' radar. Pirlo has made no secret of his desire to bring in frontline reinforcements as he looks to relieve the burden on the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Alvaro Morata. Quagliarella is no stranger to life in Turin having represented the Old Lady between 2010-2014, making 84 Serie A appearances for the club and scoring 23 goals. After four years at Juventus, Quagliarella departed for Torino before securing a move to Sampdoria in 2016 where he has enjoyed the most prolific goalscoring form of his career. He may be 37, but his scoring record for the club is sensational - netting 79 goals in 171 appearances to date. The form of Quagliarella hasn't gone unnoticed and Gazzetta dello Sport report that Pirlo is keeping tabs on him, having previously played alongside him for three years at Juve. The Sampdoria striker turns 38 at the end of January, and with his contract up in the summer he would be a shrewd signing in the short-term, as well as being extremely cost effective. Quagliarella isn't the only name on Pirlo's wish list, however, with former Tottenham benchwarmer Fernando Llorente another potential target for the club. Napoli's Arkadiusz Milik has been mooted as another striker in Juve's crosshairs, but the Polish international may not get a move because of Gli Azzurri's steep asking price.
