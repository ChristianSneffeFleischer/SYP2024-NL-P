Tottenham Hotspur have made an approach to sign Cagliari midfielder Nahitan Nandez this summer. Head coach Nuno Espirito Santo and managing director of football Fabio Paratici are looking to offload a number of fringe players in the squad, one of whom is Frenchman Moussa Sissoko, who lost his place in the team towards the end of last season and was an unused substitute in Nuno's first game. It appears as though Spurs are already preparing for life without Sissoko as Sky Sport Italia state that they have reached out to Cagliari over a deal to sign 25-year-old Uruguay international Nandez. The versatile midfielder, who plays centrally but can shift out to the right and even help out in defence, handed in a transfer request at Cagliari earlier this summer in an attempt to force a move to Inter which never came to fruition. Spurs have been alerted to his situation, but they are not the only English side as both Leeds and West Ham are chasing Nandez's signature. Leeds have been on Nandez's tail for years now and appear prepared to pounce on the uncertainty surrounding his future at Cagliari, but interest from other sides could well spark an unwanted bidding war. There's no mention of just how much Cagliari are looking for to part ways with Nandez, but when talks were on with Inter earlier in the window, the belief was that a fee of around  Â£20m would get the job done.
