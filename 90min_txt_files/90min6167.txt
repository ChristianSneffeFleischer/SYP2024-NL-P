Newcastle remain keen on bringing in free agent Ryan Fraser this summer, with the Scottish winger set to decide his future soon. Fraser made 28 Premier League appearances for Bournemouth in 2019/20, but his time with the club ended on a sour note as he refused to sign a short-term extension to his contract in order to complete the campaign with the Cherries.  We can also confirm that Ryan Fraser has declined to sign a short-term contract extension. #afcb ?https://t.co/JEsuO4juxW The 26-year-old's decision was even more frustrating for fans considering the position of the club in the table at the time. After departing the club, Fraser watched on as Bournemouth were relegated from the top flight.  The Shields Gazette now report that Newcastle remain interested in bringing the forward to the club, with Steve Bruce a big fan of his. The Magpies are in talks with Fraser regarding a move, and the player himself is expected to make a decision soon.  It is noted that Newcastle's interest in Fraser has not been impacted in any way by the failed takeover attempt of the club, as they had been tracking him since the beginning of 2019.  In an attempt to beat off interest from elsewhere, the Premier League outfit attempted to get Fraser to sign a pre-contract back in May - but this proved unsuccessful. 90min learned back in March that Arsenal, Tottenham and Everton were all interested in his services and, as a result, Fraser wasn't keen to tie himself down to a new club when Newcastle came calling in May.
