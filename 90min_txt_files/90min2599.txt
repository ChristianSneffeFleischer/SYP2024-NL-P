Nottingham Forest have completed the signing of Atletico Madrid full-back Renan Lodi on a season-long loan deal. The Brazilian is Forest's 19th signing of what has been a quite extraordinary summer of spending, and joins initially until the end of the season with an option to buy. Lodi is the third left-back Forest have purchased this summer, after Harry Toffolo and Omar Richards' arrivals earlier in the window, though the latter is sidelined after sustaining a leg fracture in training. 90min understands that Forest are also closing in on the signing of free agent and former Tottenham Hotspur right-back Serge Aurier. The Ivorian left Villarreal at the end of the 2021/22 season after the Spaniards opting against exercising a two-year contract extension written into the deal he signed when leaving north London. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  &  Toby Cudworth  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Lucas Paqueta's potential move to West Ham, Chelsea's plans to sign Anthony Gordon, Wesley Fofana and Arsen Zakharyan and the latest from Old Trafford.
