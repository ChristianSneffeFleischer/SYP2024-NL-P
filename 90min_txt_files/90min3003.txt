Julian Nagelsmann has admitted that Harry Kane's price tag makes a potential move from Bayern Munich unlikely. The Bundesliga champions recently lost Robert Lewandowski to Barcelona and are on the hunt for a new striker, though they did sign Liverpool forward Sadio Mane earlier in the transfer window. Kane is a name which has popped up in conjunction with Bayern - chief executive Oliver Kahn even called the England international a 'dream of the future' - but head coach Nagelsmann has rubbished talk of a move happening anytime soon. He said:    He   s very expensive, that   s the problem. He could score a lot in the Bundesliga. I don   t know the price, but it   s really tough for Bayern Munich. We   ll see what happens in the future.' Bild claim Bayern are instead planning a 2023 move for Kane, having asked the striker's 'environment' whether a move to Bavaria could be a possibility.
