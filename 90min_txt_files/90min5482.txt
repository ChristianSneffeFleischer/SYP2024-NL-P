Lyon rejected a bid from Tottenham Hotspur to take striker Moussa Demb  l   on loan with a view to a permanent move. Jos   Mourinho has spent most of this summer looking for a striker to offer some cover for talisman Harry Kane, and Spurs eventually settled on Brazilian Carlos Vin  cius, who joined from on a season-long loan from Benfica.        We are delighted to announce the signing of striker Carlos Vinicius on a season-long loan from Benfica.#BemVindoVin  cius        #COYS However, according to Get French Football News, they initially hoped to land Demb  l  . Talks between the two sides were held early last week, with Spurs hopeful of getting a deal done thanks to help from agent Pini Zahavi, who is close with the club and also represents Demb  l  . The 24-year-old, who managed 24 goals in all competitions last season but is goalless in his first six games this year, was keen to make the move to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and is said to have been annoyed when the deal fell through. Once it became clear that Demb  l   was off the table, Spurs reignited their interest in Vin  cius, who comes with the option to be signed permanently for somewhere around the  Â£40m mark. Demb  l   isn't the only player Spurs look to have missed out on. According to The Athletic's David Ornstein, talks were also held over a loan bid for Manchester City centre-back John Stones. Spurs, who appear unlikely to land top defensive target Milan   kriniar, are believed to be unwilling to meet City's financial demands over Stones, which has seen them turn their attention to alternatives like Chelsea's Antonio R  diger. R  diger has attracted interest from AC Milan, however, so Spurs may find themselves scrambling to find reinforcements before the transfer window shuts. While talks over a potential new face will continue, it is understood that most of Spurs' attention is focused on shifting some of the unwanted squad players.
