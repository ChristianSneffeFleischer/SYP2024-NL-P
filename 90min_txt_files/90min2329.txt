Athletico Paranaense prodigy Vitor Roque, a talent linked with Barcelona, Real Madrid and Juventus, has revealed it is his    dream    to play for a club in Europe. Only 17 but possessing the physical and mental attributes of a 23-year-old in the eyes of Athletico coach Luiz Felipe Scolari, Roque will play for the Brazilian club in the 2022 Copa Libertadores final against domestic rivals Flamengo on Saturday night. Mundo Deportivo has reported that Barcelona are closely watching Roque, matching with football director Mateu Alemany   s recent declaration that the club intends to pursue a two-pronged recruitment strategy     free agents and young talents     amid ongoing financial concerns. It is said that Barcelona have had scouting reports on him from    several games    and that he is also endorsed by Deco, former player and an adviser to the club on all things Brazil, as well as the agent who brought Raphinha to Camp Nou during the summer. MD also highlights that Real and Juve are interested in Roque and that Athletico would seek a transfer fee in the region of    35m to    40m, comparable with the kind of numbers that have previously taken the likes of Vinicius Junior, Rodrygo and Lucas Paqueta to Europe. The player himself insists he is not bothered about which club he joins, but has clearly stated that he sees a move from South America to Europe as part of his future.
