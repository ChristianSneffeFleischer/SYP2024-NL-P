Al Nassr are closing in on the signing of Inter midfielder Marcelo Brozovic in a huge blow to Barcelona's transfer plans, 90min understands. Barcelona have bid farewell to Sergio Busquets this summer and had identified Brozovic as a potential replacement at the base of their midfield. The La Liga champions reached out to Brozovic and asked him to delay a decision on his future while they figured out whether they could make him a formal offer, but sources have confirmed to 90min that such a proposal has not arrived. Brozovic had been interested in joining Barcelona but, like Lionel Messi, was not prepared to wait around for an offer which may never have arrived and is now expected to put pen to paper in Saudi Arabia. Talks between Inter and Al Nassr had stalled earlier this week but 90min understands the process is back on track. feed Inter CEO Beppe Marotta recently offered an update on Brozovic's future, insisting the deal was not dead. "When it comes to a player, many factors take over," Marotta told Sky Italia. "Clearly the economic one is the most important one.  "The situation is not closed and is not defined. Who decides is the player himself. We are not obligated to give him up. The biggest problem is the contractual relationship between him and the new club.  "If there is a solution we will close the issue, otherwise we will take him off the market."
