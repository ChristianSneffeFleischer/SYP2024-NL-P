Bayern Munich defender Benjamin Pavard has admitted he is open to a fresh challenge after spending seven seasons in Germany and winning everything there is to win in that time. Pavard has been an important player for the Bundesliga champions since joining from Sruttgart in 2019 and has often been linked with a hadnful of other clubs. With his contract expiring in 2024, Bayern would most likely wish to sell him in one of the next two transfer windows if the player is to decide he doesn't want to sign a new deal. "No, there were no specific discussions. For now, I'm focused on the World Cup, on being the best I can be at a very big club, one of the best in the world," he told L'Equipe when asked if he had discussed his future with Bayern. "I have immense respect for Bayern, I learned there the requirement of a very high level and it is an honour to wear this shirt.    Afterwards, I have been in Germany for seven years, I have won everything with the club. I'm not against discovering a new project. Maybe now is the time. Why not discover a new country, a new culture? But the sports project must be interesting.    When asked specifically what he wants in the future, Pavard said to experience a different culture.
