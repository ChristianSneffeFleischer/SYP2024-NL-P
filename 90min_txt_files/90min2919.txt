RB Leipzig have completed the signing of Germany international full-back David Raum from Bundesliga rivals Hoffenheim. The 24-year-old only joined Hoffenheim from Greuther Furth last season but enjoyed a fine debut season in the German top flight operating up and down the left flank, contributing 13 assists and three goals. As reported by 90min, Raum moved across both Manchester United and Manchester City's respective radars earlier this summer. However, United ultimately moved for Feyenoord's Tyrell Malacia, while City are now focusing their attentions on Brighton's Marc Cucurella. That cleared the path for Leipzig to make their move, and Raum has now signed for the east German club for a fee of around    30m including add-ons on a five-year contract until 2027. Speaking to Leipzig's official website following his move, Raum revealed the draw of Champions League football had been a factor in his decision: "I am very happy about my move to RB Leipzig. The club tried hard to get me and the discussions with coach Domenico Tedesco, the sporting management and managing director Oliver Mintzlaff quickly convinced me that the step to Leipzig was absolutely the right one for me.
