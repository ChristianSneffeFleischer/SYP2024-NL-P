Welcome, @LuukdeJong9! ??#DeJongCuler ?       De Jong has spent the last two years at Sevilla, scoring 19 goals in 94 appearances across all competitions, following a 2019 transfer from PSV Eindhoven. The departure of Griezmann, has returned to Atletico on a one-year loan with the option of a further year and an obligation to buy, and the arrival of De Jong leaves Bar  a with only the Dutchman, fellow countryman Memphis Depay and Martin Braithwaite as their current options up front. Sergio Aguero is currently sidelined with a calf injury, while Ousmane Dembele underwent knee surgery in June. The club was also, of course, unable to register a new contract for Lionel Messi because of failure to comply with La Liga salary regulations, paving the way for his move to PSG. De Jong started his career at De Graafschap in the Netherlands but was quickly poached by Twente after only a handful of first-team appearances. He won the Eredivisie with the club in 2009/10 and the KNVB Cup the following year, before a breakout season as a prolific goalscorer earned him a move to to Germany and Borussia Monchengladbach in 2012. De Jong   s golden touch deserted him at Gladbach in a debut season that included an early injury setback. He failed to find the net at all in the first half of the 2013/14 campaign, before then playing 12 games without scoring while on loan at Newcastle in the second half.
