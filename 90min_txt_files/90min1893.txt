Wolves are locked in talks with a number of sides across the globe as they look to bolster their squad, 90min understands. Molineux officials are looking to complete deals for Flamengo's Joao Gomes, PSG's Pablo Sarabia and Nice's Mario Lemina, with negotiations over all three players moving in the right direction. Manager Julen Lopetegui has made it clear that investment in the squad is needed this month to drag the team, who currently sit 19th, out of a relegation battle, and those in charge have responded with the signing of Matheus Cunha from Atletico Madrid. Wolves are not finished there, however, and sources have confirmed to 90min that there could be three new faces through the door soon as talks progress over Gomes, Sarabia and Lemina. Gomes, a 21-year-old midfielder, has been tracked by the likes of Liverpool and Real Madrid in the past but is now closing in on a  Â£14m move to Molineux. If Wolves get their wish, he will be joined by Sarabia. The 30-year-old has been targeted on an initial loan deal but club officials are open to striking a permanent agreement if that is what it will take to get a transfer done.
