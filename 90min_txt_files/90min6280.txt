Rachid Ghezzal is keen to depart Leicester City this summer in favour of a permanent move to Fiorentina. The Algerian was signed from Lyon in the summer of 2018 as a like-for-like replacement for Riyad Mahrez, who had joined Manchester City, but struggled to adapt in his first season at the King Power before being sent out on loan to La Viola last summer.  Ghezzal appeared 23 times for Leicester last season but scored just three times, including just once in the Premier League, and although he hardly had a profound effect on the Fiorentina squad this season - making just two goal contributions in 17 appearances - Ghezzal's brother, who's also his agent, has confirmed the winger has a 'great desire' to stay in Florence for the long-haul.     [Coach Beppe] Iachini has found his right position, which benefits him and the team,     said Abdelkader Ghezzal after his brother opened his Serie A account in a 3-1 midweek win at Lecce.     His future? We do not know, now it is important to finish the season well. He has a great desire to stay in Florence,    he added, speaking to Radio Sportivo.  Speaking about life in Florence to Italian news outlet Firenzeviola last November, Ghezzal said:    It is very different from Leicester, both the city and life.
