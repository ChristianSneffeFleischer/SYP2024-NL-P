Manchester United are thought to have rejected a request from out of favour defender Marcos Rojo to cancel the remainder of his contract. Rojo is one of several United players who remain at Old Trafford, despite being deemed surplus to requirements by manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Phil Jones, Jesse Lingard, Sergio Romero are other notable senior players the club couldn   t find acceptable exits for. Rojo, Jones and Romero have even been left out of the club   s Champions League squad, highlighting their current status. Rojo in particular hasn   t played for United at all since November 2019 and has started only 11 Premier League games since the start of the 2017/18 season. United were thought to be holding out for  £30m when Everton were credited with interest in Rojo in the summers of both 2018 and 2019, but no deal ever materialised. Journalist Duncan Castles has claimed it reached the point this summer where Rojo asked United to pay off the final year of his contract. That would have seen him become a free agent, while also pocketing a substantial windfall to offset any drop in lower wages offered by a new club. United had already negotiated a pay off deal with Alexis Sanchez earlier in the summer, agreeing to hand over between an estimated  £5m and  £10m to get the Chilean off the books. Elsewhere, West Ham are also thought to have paid up Jack Wilshere   s contract in order to release him. But United seemingly weren   t prepared to do it for Rojo, which left the player unable to accept the rumoured offers from un-named clubs in Turkey, which he is said to have been willing to join.
