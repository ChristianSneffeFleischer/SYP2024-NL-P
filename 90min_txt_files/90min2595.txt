Wolverhampton Wanderers have agreed a deal worth    22m for VfB Stuttgart striker Sasa Kalajdzic, 90min can confirm. The 25-year-old was linked with a move to Manchester United earlier in the transfer window, but opened talks with Wolves over a move to Molineux last week. Sources have now confirmed to 90min that an agreement for a transfer worth    22m including add-ons has been reached, with the Austrian international now set to undergo a medical before signing a five-year contract in the west midlands. Wolves have been looking for additional reinforcements up front after allowing former club-record signing Fabio Silva to join Anderlecht on loan - a move which left Raul Jimenez, who picked up an injury in pre-season, as the club's only recognised striker. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  &  Toby Cudworth  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Lucas Paqueta's potential move to West Ham, Chelsea's plans to sign Anthony Gordon, Wesley Fofana and Arsen Zakharyan and the latest from Old Trafford. Available on  all audio platforms  and the  90min YouTube channel. If you can't see the podcast embed, click  here  to download the episode in full! Kalajdzic has been with Stuttgart for three seasons and has made 60 appearances to date in all competitions, scoring 24 goals.
