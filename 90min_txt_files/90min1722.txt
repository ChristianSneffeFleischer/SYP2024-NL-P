Sporting CP manager Ruben Amorim has warned Tottenham that he will not take right-back Pedro Porro out of his starting lineup until a transfer has been 100% agreed. 90min understands Tottenham are confident they will get a deal over the line for the 23-year-old eventually, but Sporting's reluctance to budge from their asking price of Porro's    45m release clause has led to some lengthy negotiations which are not yet over. And while Porro is still contracted to Sporting, Amorim will not hesitate to use the right-back and risk an injury which could see the entire move collapse. "Porro does not leave before the game," Amorim said ahead of Saturday's Allianz Cup final against Porto. "Clubs have to come first, and as far as I know, a player who is able to play and is signed up by a club, he has to go to games. "I realise that [negotiations] involve a lot of players' minds, but the indication I have is that Porro is fit, and the most important thing for me, as a manager, is that if he wasn't there, there would be someone else. The game cannot be played with just one player. Porro is fit. Whatever has to happen will happen, we are prepared for all scenarios."
