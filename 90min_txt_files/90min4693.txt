Leeds United winger Raphinha has said he's "really happy" at the club as speculation over a move to Liverpool bubbles under the surface. The  Â£17m summer signing has adapted to life in England well after joining from Rennes, taking to the Premier League seamlessly to become an integral part of Marcelo Bielsa's wonderful to watch attack. His form has led many to suggest a move away could be on the cards, but the Yorkshire side are under no pressure to sell their prized assets while they continue to receiving financial backing from NFL franchise San Francisco 49ers, who own a share of the club. Now, speaking to the official club website, the Brazilian has sought to clarify his future, saying: "I   m really happy and so satisfied to be a part of this club. When I found that Leeds were interested for me and they wanted me and the way they accepted me, the way I was embraced, the way I was treated on arrival here means and I am really happy now. "Today, I   m really well settled in the city and the club. I thank everybody for their affection. They contributed to this." Raphinha has excited the Leeds fanbase since his arrival, so far notching five goals and five assist in his maiden Premier League campaign. Liverpool have been the side most heavily linked with a move, with many suggesting that Raphinha's intense style of play and direct running with the ball would suit Jurgen Klopp's side.
