Inter Miami are in negotiations with Lionel Messi's representatives and are willing to meet the legendary forward's wage demands to bring him to MLS, 90min understands.  MLS commissioner Don Garber confirmed this weekend that a number of clubs were keen to sign the diminutive forward, with 90min understanding that Inter Miami are one of said clubs who are interested and have the financial capacity to sign Messi.  The club have been in contact with the PSG and Argentina star's representatives recently and, on top of being willing to meet his wage demands, Inter Miami are also willing to sign a number of players that Messi would want to play with.  One of these players is Luis Suarez, who has recently been linked with the MLS club, as is Sergio Busquets - although the latter seems to be a less financially feasible signing.  Inter Miami currently have two Designated Player slots open on the roster, given Gonzalo Higuain's recent retirement. Though the South Florida side continues to deal with the sanctions imposed in 2021, seeing a $2,271,250 reduction in allocation dollars for the 2022 and 2023 seasons.  90min have learned that David Beckham - who owns Inter Miami - is keen to bring a big name player to the club and believes that Messi is one that the club can feasibly sign.  Current free agent Cristiano Ronaldo was also contacted by the club, but we understand that Ronaldo's current priority is to remain in Europe and that attempts to sign CR7 have proved unsucessful.
