Chelsea believe they will soon strike a deal with Barcelona to sign striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, 90min understands, and talks have reignited over left-back Marcos Alonso moving in the opposite direction. Personal terms have already been agreed between both players and their respective suitors, but the Blues' initial bid of  £15m plus Alonso was rejected as Barcelona had concerns over their ability to register the Spaniard. Indeed, talks over Alonso's potential move to Camp Nou were put on hold as Barcelona felt they may not be able to clear the salary needed to include the 31-year-old in their squad, but sources have confirmed to 90min that talks over a transfer are back on. It is understood that negotiations for both Alonso and Aubameyang are being kept separate. Chelsea are expected to agree to a deal worth around  £25m for 33-year-old Aubameyang, who has already given the green light to a move to Stamford Bridge and has been waiting for the two clubs to agree on a fee. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  &  Toby Cudworth  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Lucas Paqueta's move to West Ham, Chelsea's plans to sign Anthony Gordon, Wesley Fofana and Arsen Zakharyan and the latest from Old Trafford.
