Rodrygo has revealed he had an agreement to join Barcelona before he opted to sign for Clasico rivals Real Madrid. The Brazilian youngster made his name in his homeland with Santos before joining Los Blancos in 2019 for around  Â£40m. He has since won seven trophies with the club, including Champions League and La Liga titles. While he has enjoyed success at the Bernabeu in recent years, Rodrygo has claimed only a late move from Real prompted him to join the Madrid giants over the Catalans. He told Goal: "When my father told me the news...I always tell this story. I had two shirts: one for Bar  a and one for Real Madrid and I had to choose. It was very easy for me to choose. "But it was all agreed with Barcelona, it was a surprise for me, I didn   t expect Real Madrid to come. It was a scare but then it was one of the happiest moments of my life."
