Wolves have agreed a deal to sign striker Willian Jose on loan from Real Sociedad as they bid to fill the void left by the injured Raul Jimenez. Jimenez has been Wolves' top scorer in each of his two seasons at Molineux but is currently sidelined after fracturing his skull in November following a sickening head collision with Arsenal's David Luiz. Nuno Espirito Santo's side have picked up just one Premier League victory since Jimenez's injury, and are expected to dip into the market in January in order to strengthen their forward options. According to Spanish radio station Cadena SER (via Football Espana editor Collin Millar), Wolves have agreed a deal to sign Real Sociedad forward Willian Jose on loan, with an option to buy. Sociedad have a deal to sign Sevilla striker Carlos Fernandez in the pipeline and as a result are willing to allow Willian Jose to depart. Sociedad are also poised to re-sign Martin Odegaard on loan from Real Madrid.  The midfielder enjoyed a successful 2019/20 season on loan at Sociedad, before returning to the Bernanbeu in the summer. However, he has featured just seven times for Zinedine Zidane's side this season. ??         @RealSociedad pic.twitter.com/AK3CYqofYO Willian Jose was linked with a move to the Premier League during the 2019/20 January transfer window, as Tottenham attempted to sign a replacement for the injured Harry Kane. The striker was even left out of Sociedad's matchday squads as the interest started to intensify, but Spurs were ultimately unable to meet Sociedad's valuation of the player.
