Newcastle United had drawn up a list of five 'prime' targets they would have considered had their Saudi Arabian-backed takeover gone through. The Magpies claimed towards the beginning of September that the Premier League had rejected a takeover bid made by PCP Capital Partners, the Reuben Brothers and the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia (PIF). based on the Owners and Directors test.  This was despite the fact that the club claimed they had provided the Premier League with 'overwhelming evidence' to show that the PIF should have passed the test.  Club statement.#NUFC It could have been a very different summer transfer window had the takeover gone through. The likes of Kylian Mbappe were linked when talk of the takeover first began (because why not?) but the Chronicle have now revealed a shortlist of five players who would have been targeted.  Now-Manchester City duo Ferran Torres and Nathan Ake were both considered 'prime targets'. Torres joined the Sky Blues from Valencia for an initial    25m, while Ake signed from Bournemouth for around   Â£41m. Another player who was also considered a prime target was former Lille forward Victor Osimhen.  Of course, the striker ended up departing the French club and joined Napoli during the summer for an initial    60m after he managed 18 goals and six assists in 38 games for Lille during the 2019/20 season.
