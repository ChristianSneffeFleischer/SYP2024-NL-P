Nottingham Forest have completed the signing of midfielder Jonjo Shelvey from Newcastle United. Shelvey joins on a permanent deal, signing a two-and-a-half-year contract at the City Ground.    It   s a pleasure to be here. As soon as I found out Forest were interested, it caught my eye straight away and I just couldn   t wait to get down here," said Shelvey, who will wear the number 6 shirt for Forest.    It   s a fantastic football club that has so much history and I   m really looking forward to getting started.    My main goal straight away is to fight for my place in the team and stay there. It   s not going to be easy because there   s a lot of competition for places, but it   s a challenge I   m really looking forward to and the competitiveness can only help the team going forward.    I spoke to Eddie Howe and he had such good words to say about Steve Cooper. I previously knew of him from my time at Liverpool, so I knew what a fantastic coach he was, but meeting him for the first time has been a breath of fresh air.
