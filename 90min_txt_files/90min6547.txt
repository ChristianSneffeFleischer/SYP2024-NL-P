Everton have joined the list of Premier League clubs tracking Real Valladolid defender Mohammed Salisu, with Manchester United and Southampton also interested.  The 21-year-old has made 29 La Liga appearances this season, helping Valladolid pull away from the relegation zone prior to football's enforced break. He is also leading the division in clearances and has earned plaudits for his solid performances throughout the campaign. According to the Mirror, Salisu is hot property with a host of English clubs interested. Everton are the latest side to enter the race, asking to be 'kept informed on developments', and he could be available for as little as  Â£10m due to a release clause in his contract.  He has already dismissed interest from Rennes in France but Atletico Madrid are ready to rival the Premier League sides for his signature. He is not the only centre back the Toffees have been linked with recently. A source told 90min earlier this month that the Merseysiders are among a quintet of Premier League clubs in the hunt for Thiago Silva's signature, while Lille's Gabriel Magalhaes is also on their radar, though they face stiff competition from Napoli for the Brazilian. Manchester United have also been linked with Salisu in the past and they continue to monitor his situation as he represents good value in what is bound to be a volatile transfer market going forward.
