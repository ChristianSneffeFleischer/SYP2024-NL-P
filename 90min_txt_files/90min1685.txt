Newcastle United forward Allan Saint-Maximin has admirers from Milan and clubs in the Middle East with the possibility of leaving St James' Park in the next few days still on the table, sources have told 90min. The Frenchman has battled with injury for much of this season, but even when fit has struggled to consistently find a place in Eddie Howe's starting lineup. 90min reported last week that the Magpies' desire to bring in a new wide player this month - which ended up being Everton's Anthony Gordon - did not go down well with Saint-Maximin, while the club have been considering letting him leave regardless. While Newcastle at least remain open to offers for Saint-Maximin this window, 90min understands that they would like to have an immediate replacement lined up in order to sanction a sale. Leeds United's Jack Harrison is on their radar, but such a quick turnaround is unlikely prior to Tuesday's transfer deadline. Milan are one side interested in taking Saint-Maximin off of Newcastle's hands, while he is also attracting interest from clubs in Qatar and the UAE. Listen now as  Scott Saunders  hosts  Graeme Bailey  and  Toby Cudworth  to discuss why Joao Cancelo looks set to join Bayern Munich on loan from Man City, Arsenal's ongoing pursuit of Moises Caicedo & the futures of Pedro Porro, Enzo Fernandez, Youri Tielemans and more.

The transfer window in the UAE closes next week and would give teams there ample time to lodge a bid, but as mentioned this would not fit into Newcastle's timeframe to secure a replacement.
