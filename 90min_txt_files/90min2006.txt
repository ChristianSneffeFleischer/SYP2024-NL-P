Paris Saint-Germain captain Marquinhos has confirmed that contract talks with the club are ongoing, giving a positive update about the status of the negotiations. Marquinhos, who joined PSG as a teenager way back in 2013, has just entered the final 18 months of the current four-year deal he signed in 2020. It runs until the end of next season. Speaking to the French media about his future following PSG   s shock 3-1 defeat to Lens in Ligue 1 on Sunday, the Brazilian said,    Talks are progressing well.    Journalist Fabrizio Romano has also reported that the length of the proposed deal is the only remaining sticking point, with talks still needed to determine whether it will be until 2026 or 2027. For a player that has made over 500 career appearances for club and country, Marquinhos is still relatively young. He will only turn 29 in May and has captained PSG since Thiago Silva left in 2020. The centre-back has also captained Brazil on occasion in the same player   s absence since 2018. Even in defeat, PSG have remained top of Ligue 1 following the Lens game. But with Lens already their closest challengers in the table, the lead has been cut to four points. Marseille and Monaco are likely already too far back (11 points) to mount a serious charge in the second half of the season. Speaking about the game itself, Marquinhos played down any wider significance, insisting it hinged on isolated key moments and stressing the importance of avoiding any kneejerk reactions given how well the first half of the campaign had gone     14 wins and two draws from 16 games.    We must not question everything.  Lens was simply better than us, more efficient,    he said, via L   Equipe.     It was a very open game too.  They are better than us physically too.  And we conceded in the important moments of the match.
