West Ham United have had an offer for Lille midfielder Amadou Onana turned down, 90min can confirm. The Hammers are looking to add further depth to David Moyes's squad, with bringing in a new central midfielder to offset the workload of Declan Rice and Tomas Soucek high on the agenda. Rice and Soucek, alongside the more attack-minded duo of Manuel Lanzini and Pablo Fornals, are currently the only options at the club following Mark Noble's retirement and Alex Kral's return to Spartak Moscow after a disappointing loan spell. 20-year-old Onana has only been at Lille for one season and is contracted to the club until 2026, having joined from Hamburg, but West Ham have identified him as a player who could beef up their squad ahead of another season containing European football. However, 90min understands that West Ham's opening offer for Onana, who played 32 Ligue 1 games last season and has previously been linked with Arsenal and Liverpool, has been rejected by Lille. Listen now to 90min's Talking Transfers podcast, with  Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey,  Harry Symeou  &  Toby Cudworth. On the latest show they discuss Richarlison's move to Tottenham, where Lisandro Martinez could be heading and more. Available on  all audio platforms  and the  90min YouTube channel.

It remains to be seen whether or not West Ham will make a new offer for Onana, with Burnley midfielder Josh Brownhill one of a number of other targets under consideration. The Hammers must also weigh up the cost of any deal impacting their desire to sign a left-back and centre forward.
