Bayern Munich sporting director Hasan Salihamidzic has revealed that club officials voted against making an approach for unsettled Manchester United superstar Cristiano Ronaldo this summer. Ronaldo has grown frustrated at United following the club   s failure to qualify for this season   s Champions League, asking the Old Trafford hierarchy to consider offers for him. Bayern, Chelsea and Atletico Madrid were all linked with the 37-year-old but all soon backed away. More recently, Ronaldo   s first professional club Sporting CP have shown interest. Bayern have already brought in Sadio Mane this summer and, despite selling Robert Lewandowski, are flush with attacking talent. Losing Lewandowski hasn   t slowed them down, averaging five goals per game in the new Bundesliga campaign so far.    When you now see how our attack is equipped - even without Robert Lewandowski - it's just difficult from a sporting and financial point of view,    Salihamidzic told BILD's Phrasenmaher podcast on the subject of the Ronaldo saga.    We have eight players for four positions upfront. We have established top players who are in the prime of their footballing age. We have talent that we want to give playing time too, so we all voted to go through with our plan.    [Signing Ronaldo] was out of question for us. We are very happy with how we're equipped.    Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey,  Toby Cudworth  and  Harry Symeou  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Antony attempting to push through a move to Man Utd, Frenkie de Jong and Pierre-Emerick Aubayemang's futures at Barcelona and Arsenal's interest in Pedro Neto.
