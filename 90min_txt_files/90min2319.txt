Manchester United are among a number of clubs paying close attention to Argentinian midfielder Enzo Fernandez and have scouted the player in recent weeks, 90min understands. Fernandez joined Benfica from River Plate in July, and has set European football alight since making the move - helping his club to an unbeaten start in this season's Portuguese Primeira Liga and through the group stages of the Champions League.  Benfica have already reached the last 16 ahead of Juventus, qualifying alongside Paris Saint-Germain. 21-year-old Fernandez has been tracked by a number of Premier League clubs for months - the likes of United, Manchester City and Newcastle were interested prior to his move to Benfica - though Wolves came closest to bringing him to England last summer before he chose to move to Portugal. Wolves representatives even flew out to South America to tie up a transfer, but a deal was signed off with Benfica before they arrived. They ended up signing Matheus Nunes from Sporting CP. Scott Saunders  hosts  Graeme Bailey  and  Toby Cudworth  in the latest episode of Talking Transfers.

United have though continued to track his progress during his time in Europe and have watched him in recent weeks, though they are not alone in their continued interest. Erik ten Hag's side signed Casemiro from Real Madrid in the summer after spending a number of months chasing Frenkie de Jong, and ultimately failing to get the deal over the line. United's interest in the Dutchman remains but it's understood his camp will reassess the situation at the end of the season before making a decision on next steps.
