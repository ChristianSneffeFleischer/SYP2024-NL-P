The president of Roc Nation, the agency of Chelsea striker Romelu Lukaku, appears to have shut down rumours they could cut ties with the Belgian after his summer transfer to Inter collapsed. After months of pushing to sign Lukaku, Inter abandoned their pursuit of the 30-year-old over the weekend after learning that he had spoken with Juventus about a possible transfer - despite Lukaku himself insisting Inter were his only option. The chaotic situation led to reports in Italy suggesting Roc Nation were so furious with Lukaku's conduct that they could tear up his contract with the agency. However, Roc Nation president Michael Yormark now appears to have shot such speculation down. "Fake news and irresponsible reporting must stop," he wrote on Instagram. "Focus on facts and the truth." feed The collapse of his move to Inter saw fans with long memories dig out Lukaku's previous quotes on a possible move to Juventus from back in 2021. "If Juventus or AC Milan will call me in the future? Never, never," the striker said previously. "Again, never. It's never going to happen. "Juventus wanted me before Inter, but when [Antonio] Conte joined Inter it was my priority to join them. In Italy, there's only Inter for me." It's for that reason that Inter have been left so frustrated with Lukaku, who is now expected to report back for pre-season training with Chelsea this week. The Blues jet off to the United States for their pre-season tour on Monday plan to do so without Lukaku, with manager Mauricio Pochettino happy to move on from the Belgian and leave the recruitment chiefs to find a solution. Juventus remain keen on a deal if they can offload Dusan Vlahovic, while an offer from Saudi Arabia remains on the table.
