Exclusive - French center-back Nicolas Isimat-Mirin is drawing attention from multiple MLS clubs, but remains in talks with Sporting Kansas City over a new contract, 90min understands. The 30-year-old has been with SKC since early 2020 after joining from Turkish giants Besiktas, going on to make 46 appearances across all competitions for Peter Vermes' side so far. Isimat-Mirin became something of a key piece for Kansas City in 2022, playing over 2,200 minutes during the MLS regular season while ranking first among his teammates for clearances (102) and second for aerial duels won (43). However, the defender's contract is due to expire next month, meaning he would be available for free agency in the new year. Isimat-Mirin remains in talks with Sporting Kansas City to renew his deal, but should those negotiations fail, 90min are told at least three 'leading' MLS clubs from both the Eastern and Western Conferences are interested in bringing him on board. What's more, Isimat-Mirin - a former France youth international - was also among the list of SKC players left unprotected for the MLS Expansion Draft, though St. Louis CITY SC went with other options.
