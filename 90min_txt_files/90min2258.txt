Tottenham Hotspur are continuing to evaluate potential long-term replacements to goalkeeper Hugo Lloris, with a number of Premier League stoppers on their radar, 90min understands. Lloris is into his 11th season at Spurs (his ninth as club captain) and while he has put in several top drawer displays in recent times, there also remains evidence of his understandable decline. The 35-year-old has previously spoken of his desire to help welcome and usher in a long-term successor, and 90min understands that Tottenham have been offered a couple of eye-catching names. Italian media linked Wojciech Szczesny - a noted Arsenal icon and Spurs antagonist - with a move to the Lilywhites last week, and sources have told 90min that the Juventus goalkeeper has indeed been offered to them by intermediaries. However, Tottenham are not actively looking to sign Szczesny at this time and Juve aren't desperate to sell him. Spurs have not shut the door on the idea entirely either, though. Chelsea's Edouard Mendy, who lost his place in the Blues' starting XI to Kepa Arrizabalaga earlier this season, has also been offered to Tottenham. The Senegal stopper is expecting not to be handed a new contract at Stamford Bridge. In terms of goalkeepers Spurs are actively keeping tabs on, 90min understands that three current Premier League number ones have caught their eye.

Everton and England's Jordan Pickford has long been of interest to Tottenham and Antonio Conte, with the club asking about him during brief discussions over Anthony Gordon last summer.
