Pep Guardiola has revealed that Gabriel Jesus and Oleksandr Zinchenko were sold to Arsenal last summer because they wanted to leave Manchester City and so there was no way back for them. The duo ended up reuniting with former City assistant Mikel Arteta at the Emirates Stadium, and the Gunners now sit top of the Premier League table after a tremendous first half to the season. Guardiola was asked at a press conference whether he regretted letting Jesus and Zinchenko leave, but his answer as a definitive one. "When they want to leave they cannot stay," he said.
