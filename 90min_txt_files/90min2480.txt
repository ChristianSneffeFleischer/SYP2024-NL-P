Newcastle United are in talks with Central Coast Mariners to finalise a deal for teenage forward Garang Kuol, sources have confirmed to 90min. The 17-year-old, who turns 18 next week, has just been called into the Australia squad for two forthcoming friendlies with rivals New Zealand and he is expected to feature, and is now being tipped to make their World Cup squad. And in what is a momentous week for Kuol, he is now close to finalising a deal with Premier League giants Newcastle - who are hoping to soon seal a deal with the Mariners. Kuol, whose brother Alou plays for Stuttgart, has already agreed terms on the move to Newcastle via his agents and is set to officially move to Tyneside in January. At this point the plan is for Kuol to move to Newcastle before a loan move to the continent - although should he make Australia's World Cup squad, he could in fact earn a work permit. That is a decision however that will be taken later down the line. Kuol, who has played a dozen first-team games having made his debut less than 12 months ago, is now set to prepare for his Australia debut and their head coach Graham Arnold is delighted to include him.    He   s showed great quality and great talent, I truly believe our kids have got it here in Australia and it   s just getting the opportunity," said Arnold. Kuol, who was born in Egypt before his family moved to Australia as an infant, bagged five goals in ten games during his maiden campaign in the A-League - although he is yet to start a game for the Mariners. But despite his tender years, the teenager has no doubts he is ready for international football with Australia.
