Liverpool are pushing ahead with plans to sign RB Leipzig centre-back Ibrahima Konate this summer, despite concerns over the significant impact of the pandemic on the club   s finances. Liverpool announced earlier this week that the club made a  £46m loss before tax for the 2019/20 season, with revenue falling as a direct result of the pandemic delaying the final nine games of the campaign and forcing Anfield to close. Costs also rose rising due to an inflating wage bill. The 2020/21 accounts, when finalised, will include media revenue for the delayed games that missed the cut-off point for last season, but matchday revenue will be almost completely wiped as Anfield has remained closed since last March     aside from just three limited capacity games. Overall, it is estimated that the pandemic has cost Liverpool  £120m in lost revenue. However, it won   t stop sorely needed investment in the playing squad, with a lack of depth in key positions brutally exposed by a number of injuries this season. The Daily Mail writes that Liverpool    remain on course    to sign Konate from Leipzig. Reds owners FSG are seemingly still prepared to trigger the 21-year-old   s release clause, thought to be in the region of  £40m, to bring him to Anfield and strengthen the defence ahead of next season. The downside of a release clause, while it serves to cap a player   s price and can sometimes make top talents available for less than their real market value, is that the money is usually fully paid up front. Last summer, Liverpool were able to navigate a lack of liquid cash by negotiating very favourable structured deals for both Thiago Alcantara and Diogo Jota, which resulted in minimal up-front costs.
