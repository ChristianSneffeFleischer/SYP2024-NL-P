West Ham boss David Moyes has revealed that he'll have the final say on all the club's transfer business this summer. Moyes was brought in by West Ham to replace Manuel Pellegrini in late December, following a dramatic drop off in form. Two wins in his 12 first league games wasn't an ideal start, but the former Manchester United manager has steered the club to safety after overseeing an impressive run of results since the Premier League resumed in June. With West Ham's Premier League status secured, Moyes is now looking to the future - stating that although finances may be restricted because of the financial impact of coronavirus, he is keen to bring in some fresh faces. More importantly, he'll have the final say on who the club do and don't go after. "I think it   s well known that the owners spent a lot of money in the last year or two, I think things are going to be much tighter," Moyes said, before West Ham's last day showdown with Aston Villa. "Quite often I   ve had to work with no money before, if I have to work with little money then I   ll do the best that I can and get the best out of a players, hoping to try and improve what we   ve got. If we can get some more in then that would be good and we   ll be moving in the right direction." "I wouldn   t do the job if I didn   t have the final say. I   m too experienced. I wouldn   t be in a situation where if I wasn   t going to get that opportunity, I wouldn   t do it." Moyes alluded to a key reason why he's so keen to have the final say, highlighting that the fact that manager's are often relieved of their duties when decisions have perhaps been taken out of their hands.
