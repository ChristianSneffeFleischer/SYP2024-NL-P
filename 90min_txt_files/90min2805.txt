Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema has revealed that he had to alter his playing style after Cristiano Ronaldo left the club in 2018. The Portugal forward departed Los Blancos as their all-time record scorer with 450 goals, while he also left on a high after winning his fourth Champions League title with the club. While a respected striker in his own right, Benzema was largely seen as a support player to Ronaldo during the latter stages of his Real career, perhaps best emphasised by the Frenchman's return of just 12 goals in 47 games in the 2017/18 season. But with Ronaldo no longer at the Santiago Bernabeu, Benzema has reignited his career and is widely expected to win this year's Ballon d'Or having led Real to Champions League glory. Speaking ahead of their UEFA Super Cup clash with Eintracht Frankfurt, Benzema admitted that he had to change his ways to accommodate for Ronaldo's exit.
