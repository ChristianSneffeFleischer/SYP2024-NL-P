Ozan Kabak has said he would love to make his loan move to Liverpool permanent this summer but is yet to discuss his future with Jurgen Klopp. The Turkey international sealed a temporary move to the Reds in January as Klopp looked to ease his side's defensive injury woes. Various reports have suggested Liverpool are keen to make Kabak's move permanent when his loan deal from Schalke expires this summer, though the youngster has confirmed no discussions have been held yet.    Jurgen has not said anything yet,    he told The Times. "We don   t speak about this topic so far. This is a huge club. I am very proud to wear this jersey so far. Every moment, every single minute, I am proud.    It   s Liverpool. Of course I want to stay. These five months have been very valuable for my career, my personality. I have met with very good people, very good footballers.    You progress with your game even in training. Yes, these five months have been very good for me, I think, regardless of whether I stay or not.    Kabak suffered a bit of a nightmare in his maiden game for Liverpool, with him and Alisson clattering into each to allow Jamie Vardy the chance to tap the ball into an empty net. He has conceded it was a tough start to life in the Premier League and the pressure he felt at such a young age was enormous.    It was tough [his debut at Leicester]," he said. "A tough opponent and a bad moment for me and Ali [Alisson] also. For a 20-year-old lad to have that much pressure was not easy. It was not easy. But I always tried to give 100% in the game whatever happened. I tried to forget it and continue.
