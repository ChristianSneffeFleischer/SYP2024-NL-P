Tottenham Hotspur are progressing in talks to sign Micky van de Ven from Wolfsburg, sources have confirmed to 90min. Spurs have been on the hunt for reinforcements at centre-back following a Premier League campaign which saw them concede a staggering 63 goals - the third worst record among teams that were not relegated to the Championship. New head coach Ange Postecoglou has made public his desire to bring in new defenders this transfer window, with 90min previously reporting that Van de Ven and Bayer Leverkusen's Edmond Tapsoba were their top targets. Bayer Leverkusen's demands of a fee in excess of  £43m for Tapsoba may have proven too much for Tottenham however, as 90min understands they are now advancing with a  £35m deal to bring in Van de Ven from fellow Bundesliga side Wolfsburg. feed The 21-year-old has played 41 times for Wolfsburg since his 2021 move from Dutch second division side Volendam, announcing himself as one of Europe's top young defenders. After a delay in finalising the deal, Spurs are also expected to complete the signing of highly-rated 18-year-old Ashley Phillips from Blackburn Rovers this week. Meanwhile, 90min reported earlier on Wednesday that Tottenham had held talks with Barcelona regarding the potential re-signing of former loanee Clement Lenglet if deals for either Tapsoba or Van de Ven fell through. Barca are determined to move on from the France international this window.
