Newcastle boss Steve Bruce is plotting a summer raid on his former club Aston Villa should they fail to achieve survival, with John McGinn top of his wishlist. Bruce brought McGinn to Villa Park during his time in charge at the club, fending off interest from Scottish champions Celtic to secure the services of the midfielder.  The Scotland international has proved a huge hit since his arrival in England, scoring six goals to help Villa gain promotion to the Premier League in his first season at the club, though injuries have severely hampered his maiden season in England   s top flight.  Villa are perilously close to a return to the Championship after just one season away. They currently sit 18th     three points adrift of safety with just two games to play     and should they fail to survive the drop, Bruce is keen to instigate a reunion with McGinn. Despite the club still awaiting Premier League approval for their Saudi-backed takeover, and with Bruce   s future at the club unclear, the Newcastle boss remains adamant that he will go about his transfer business as normal until told otherwise.    Obviously, we need to see where we are and what we are but we are pressing on and planning in terms of going forward,    Bruce said, quoted by the Daily Star.    Hopefully, we'll be in a position to do some business sooner rather than later.    Bruce has already held several meetings with Newcastle managing director Lee Charnley and the club's head of recruitment Steve Nickson regarding his summer transfer plans.
