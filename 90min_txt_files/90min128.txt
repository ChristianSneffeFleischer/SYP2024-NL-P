Brighton & Hove Albion have agreed a club record transfer fee with Ajax for Ghana forward Mohammed Kudus, sources have confirmed to 90min. Brighton have been tracking Kudus all summer, as 90min has already revealed, and now they have pushed ahead and finalised the terms of a deal with Ajax.  The Seagulls have met Ajax's asking price of    40m ( Â£34.5m) and that would surpass their existing club record move set earlier this summer when Joao Pedro completed his move from Watford. Kudus has now been given the green light to agree personal terms with Brighton, a detail that has not yet been finalised. Brighton are working hard to persuade him that moving to AMEX Stadium is his best next step, with manager Roberto De Zerbi convinced that the Ghanaian is an ideal signing. feed As 90min has previously revealed, Kudus has been targeted by Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester United in recent months - all have reached out to his representatives this summer and hold an interest. But none of them have made firm offers at this point, leaving Brighton in pole position to complete a deal. Kudus is currently in Germany with Ajax ahead of their pre-season clash with Borussia Dortmund on Sunday afternoon, but it remains to be seen if he will feature.
