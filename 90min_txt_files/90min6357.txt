French club Marseille are hoping to make a 'dream' double swoop for current Real Madrid manager Zinedine Zidane and former Los Blancos forward Cristiano Ronaldo - if a potential takeover goes through this summer. The Ligue 1 side had an excellent season this term, finishing second behind champions Paris Saint-Germain as the French league campaign was brought to an abrupt end due to COVID-19. With a proposed takeover of the club on the horizon - by a consortium led by Mourad Boudjellal  - potential investor Mohamed Ayachi Ajroudi is 'dreaming' of a Zidane-led Marseille side lining up with Ronaldo at its forefront. While this may be Ajroudi's ideal scenario, he was somewhat realistic regarding the possible future of the club and its manager (quotes via Le Figaro): "A new coach? The one in place is very good, but what would be better than bringing back a local lad? Zinedine Zidane? The future will tell us." This talk of the arrival of Zidane will perhaps do little to quieten the discontent surrounding the future of current manager Andr   Villas-Boas, who has already been rumoured to be on his way out. Although the idea of Zidane stepping into the dugout at the Stade Velodrome may seem far off, Ajroudi was seemingly much more excited about the possibility of bringing current Juventus star Ronaldo to France.    I love football," he added. "I love the noble side of sport. I love German discipline, especially that of  Bayern Munich. I enjoy the grinta of Barca. And a player that I will never forget is Cristiano Ronaldo. I like respect and discipline. He embodies that."  Grande vittoria! Abbiamo bisogno di questo spirito... FINO ALLA FINE ????
