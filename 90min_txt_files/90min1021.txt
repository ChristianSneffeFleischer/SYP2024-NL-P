Khephren Thuram has insisted he's happy at OGC Nice amid interest from Premier League giants Liverpool. 90min reported this week the Reds have opened talks with Thuram's representatives - along with Manu Kone's entourage, too - to gauge his current situation ahead of the summer transfer window. Liverpool have notably been in the market for midfielders recently, keeping a close eye on the likes of Ryan Gravenberch, Ruben Neves, Teun Koopmeiners and Ibrahim Sangare as well as Thuram. feed Speaking at the UNFP award ceremony this week, Thuram commented on the rumours surrounding his future at Ligue 1 club Nice. He said: "I want to progress, go on the field, have fun. For now, I'm in Nice. It's going very well. I really like the club, so I still see myself in Nice. I am very well in Nice. "There are noises, I hear, but I'm happy in Nice. I hope to grow with this club. I would like him [Didier Digard, manager] to stay because he brought a lot to this group when it was in a difficult period. "I don't know if I tell him enough but he's someone I can never thank enough. He helped me a lot in difficult times in my young career. We worked a lot together. I wish him only happiness, in Nice, or elsewhere." The 22-year-old son of France legend Lilian Thuram enjoyed a brilliant 2022/23 campaign, making the Ligue 1 team of the season and earning his first Les Bleus senior cap thanks to his all-action performances at the heart of the Nice midfield.
