Newcastle are looking at a number of attacking options as the January transfer window continues and Chelsea's Hakim Ziyech is one those under consideration, sources have confirmed to 90min. Ziyech is among a number of Chelsea players who have been told they can move in this window. The 29-year-old was looking to leave last summer, but the likes of Ajax and AC Milan failed to agree terms with Chelsea and he is now looking for that exit this month instead. After performing well at the World Cup with semi-finalists Morocco, Ziyech is keen to taste regular first-team football but he knows that will likely only be possible away from Stamford Bridge. Chelsea boss Graham Potter admitted he followed Ziyech closely in Qatar and was impressed, but admits he can't promise him the regular chance the player wants. Potter said: "We know his qualities and we like him as a player. At Chelsea there are always good players that aren't in the starting XI. [I am] delighted for him to get the game time and help [Morocco]. I kept in touch with him throughout the World Cup." Ziyech's representatives have spoken to a number of clubs to garner interest in him and one of those who have responded positively is Newcastle. Chelsea would ideally like to sell Ziyech. But with more than two years left on his current deal, a loan looks the most likely option and that is something Newcastle would potentially like to do. Newcastle and Eddie Howe would like more attacking options going into the latter part of the season, along with a midfielder and a right-back. But as a result of Financial Fair Player concerns, they look unlikely to spend big in January at this moment in time.
