Tottenham left back Danny Rose is expected to stay with the club for the rest of the season after interest from Turkish club Trabzonspor failed to materialise into a transfer. Rose is out of contract at the end of the season and will be released as a free agent, having not played for Spurs since January 2020 after being frozen out by manager Jose Mourinho. The 30-year-old England international spent the second half of last season on loan at Newcastle, but he was unable to secure a permanent move away last summer and has been completely shut out of contention in 2020/21 as his contract nears its expiry in June. Rose has not even been named in a single first-team matchday squad for Spurs this season and his only action of any description has been two Under-23 appearances in November. According to Sky Sports, the interest that Trabzonspor had has not come to anything and instead of being able to arrange another move in the few hours remaining before the transfer deadline, Rose is now likely to remain at Spurs for the final five months of his contract. When he does leave Spurs, Rose will end a 14-year association with the club, having arrived from Leeds a few weeks after his 17th birthday back in the summer of 2007. He famously scored a stunning goal against Arsenal in a north London derby on his Premier League debut in 2010, but spend time on loan at Watford, Peterborough, Bristol City and Sunderland, interspersed with a handful of Spurs appearances, before he finally became a regular in 2013.
