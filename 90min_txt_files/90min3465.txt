Tottenham forward Dejan Kulusevski has admitted that he found life at Juventus 'very frustrating' due to his lack of game time. The Sweden international signed for the Bianconeri midway through the 2019/20 season, joining up with the squad in Turin at the end of that campaign. But after emerging as one of Serie A's brightest talents with Parma, Kulusevski found it tough to make a similar impression at Juve, starting 24 times in the league in his season-and-a-half at the Allianz Stadium. Speaking to The Guardian, Kulusevski revealed how tough it was to have had his role limited.    It was hard. You really have to be strong when things are not going the way you think they should be going and there are things you can   t control. It   s very frustrating when you love something and you cannot show it. I knew I needed a change," he said. Since joining Spurs on an initial loan deal at the end of the January transfer window, Kulusevski has quickly become a fan favourite in north London. He's registered two goals and four assists in eight Premier League games playing from the right wing, though he has briefly played as a number ten and at wing-back. And the 21-year-old said that he's enjoying working under Antonio Conte, but didn't want to nail down a favourite position on the pitch.
