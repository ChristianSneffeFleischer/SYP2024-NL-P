Chelsea have have agreed to meet Shakhtar Donetsk's asking price for Mykaylo Mudryk and the player is now due to fly to London, sources have confirmed to 90min. Sources have insisted to 90min that Mudryk's desire remains to join Premier League rivals Arsenal, who themselves remain in talks with Shakhtar as well. However, unless they agree a fee themselves, the Gunners are in real danger of losing the player to Chelsea. Mudryk has been given permission to travel to England, which 90min understands he is doing after Chelsea agreed terms with both Shakhtar and his agents. Arsenal have agreed terms with the player's camp but not his club. Mudryk was with Shakhtar at a warm-weather training camp in Turkey, where he has been anxiously awaiting news on his future as Arsenal continue to try and negotiate a deal. Shakhtar confirmed a deal was close on Saturday evening, revealing in a statement: "FC Shakhtar president Rinat Akhmetov and Chelsea co-owner Behdad Eghbali discussed Mykaylo Mudryk   s transfer to Chelsea FC today. Parties are very close to agree on player   s transfer to the club." While Arsenal and Shakhtar are carrying on their talks, Chelsea now await Mudryk's arrival in England as they look to beat their Premier League rivals to his signature. Shakhtar had demanded    100m for Mudryk, pointing to figures paid by Man Utd for Antony and Man City for Jack Grealish as a precedent. Arsenal believe an overall deal worth around    80m - with add-ons taking it above    90m - is more of a correct valuation. Whether they return with a new bid is yet to be seen. Chelsea are intent on bolstering their squad this month, despite already bringing in Benoit Badiashile, Joao Felix, Andrey Santos and David Datro Fofana, in addition to finalising a pre-arranged summer deal for Christopher Nkunku.
