England Under-21 forward Noni Madueke appears to have a big decision on his hands this summer, with Bayern Munich set to rival Leeds and Crystal Palace for his signature. Madueke has exploded onto the scene at PSV this season and earned his first call-up for Aidy Bothroyd's squad at this months's U21 European Championships.  He made his debut at that level against Portugal on Sunday, and while defeat left England with no chance of qualification, Madueke's U21 bow was another step in the right direction for the 19-year-old.  Noni who?Noni Madueke.'Madueke   s bravery in swapping Spurs for PSV has been rewarded with England U21 call' ??????? News of fresh interest in his signature comes from the Evening Standard, who say that Bayern, Palace and Leeds have all 'put feelers out' as to his availability.  Palace may have a special appeal for the versatile forward, considering that's where he started out before joining Tottenham at 12 years of age.  But whether they could afford him is another matter; Madueke joined PSV from Spurs' academy in 2017, and is under contract until 2024. Madueke has raised eyebrows with his performances in the Eredivisie this season, scoring seven goals and assisting a further six. That caught the attention of Boothroyd, who had no hesitation about drafting him into the U21s for the Euros.  Noni Madueke in 2020/2021:    7 goals?    6 assists"Dit is wel echt een ruwe diamant.

He   s a powerhouse of a player, technically very good, left-footed and likes to come in off the side of the pitch, off the right and go and link.
