Liga MX player Paul Aguilar has revealed he hopes to play in Major League Soccer having been heavily linked to Austin FC earlier this year. The right back   s contract with Liga MX giants Club America recently expired, leaving him as a free agent ahead of the Major League Soccer transfer window. Reports began surging in November 2020 that Austin FC desperately wanted Aguilar to join the expansion team. ESPN first speculated on the player   s situation, stating without hesitation that Aguilar would sign for an MLS club in the next year.   The league   s website reiterated Austin FC   s interest in the player by publishing articles that supported the hypothesis. More reports stated other MLS clubs had expressed interest in Aguilar, however, Austin FC remains the only name to emerge. Most recently, Aguilar disclosed his hopes to join MLS during an interview with Fox Sports.    I hope to be back on the pitch this June. We are very close to a possible MLS move, my representative is taking care of that.    If he signs with Austin FC, he would stand as the expansion team   s second designated player after newly signed midfielder Tomas Pochettino. Should Aguilar make his way to Major League Soccer, he would join fellow Mexican national team players Chicharito Hernandez (LA Galaxy), Carlos Vela (LAFC), Alan Pulido (Sporting Kansas City), Jurgen Damm (Atlanta United) and Jonathan dos Santos (LA Galaxy.)
