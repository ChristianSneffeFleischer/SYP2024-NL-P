Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag has refused to directly answer whether pursuing a deal for Marko Arnautovic was a mistake. The Dutchman has seen United struggle to conclude deals in the summer transfer window, with the club's pursuit lengthy pursuit of Barcelona midfielder Frenkie de Jong a prime example of how difficult things have been. Moves for Tyrell Malacia, Christian Eriksen and Lisandro Martinez have been completed, but United still appear to be short in terms of what they need to compete for a top-four finish. They've also had to deal with intense speculation over the future of Cristiano Ronaldo, who is keen to leave Old Trafford in pursuit of Champions League football - although Ten Hag has denied there is a problem.
