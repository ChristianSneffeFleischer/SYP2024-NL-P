Real Madrid have been linked with a move for Red Bull Salzburg playmaker Dominik Szoboszlai, with Zinedine Zidane viewing the Hungarian as a long-term replacement for Isco. Szoboszlai emerged on the Salzburg scene shortly before Erling Haaland came to prominence, and while his numbers aren't quite Haaland-esque, they're not a million miles away. He's scored 25 goals and assisted a further 33 in his 79 appearances so far, including 17 goal involvements in his 18 appearances this season. Used predominantly off the left wing, the 20-year-old has played on the opposite flank and also as a more central attacking midfielder, and has the dexterity to impact games from anywhere on the pitch. It's easy to see, then, why the likes of Real Madrid are zeroing in.

He isn't expected to take much convincing - Real are already his 'preferred choice.' Los Blancos, of course, have a connection to his native Hungary through the legendary Ferenc Puskas. Widely regarded as one of their all-time greats, Puskas won five leagues and three European Cups with the club, scoring so many good goals in the process that he now has a Ballon d'Or ceremony award named after him. For Szoboszlai, then, the pressure is immediately on - especially if, as Bild say, they move to sign him in January.
