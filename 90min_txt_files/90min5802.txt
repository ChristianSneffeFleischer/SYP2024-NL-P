Milan are said to be 'close' to reaching an agreement with Chelsea to sign midfielder Tiemoue Bakayoko on loan, while they will also have the chance to make the move permanent for around    30m. Bakayoko is free to leave Stamford Bridge this summer as he isn't considered part of Frank Lampard's plans. The midfielder spent the 2018/19 season on loan at Milan before joining former club Monaco temporarily for the following campaign. He started 20 of the Ligue 1 side's 28 league games before their season was ended prematurely due to the coronavirus pandemic. Monaco had the option to make Bakayoko's loan move permanent for around    42.5m, but they decided against it. With the Blues looking to offload the 26-year-old this summer, a number of clubs have shown an interest - notably Milan. It has previously been suggested Bakayoko is keen on moving back to Milan and is willing to take a pay cut to make it happen, while Chelsea were prepared to lower their asking price to just  Â£20m to encourage the Serie A outfit to make a move. However, Fabrizio Romano has now reported that the Rossoneri are close to finalising a loan deal for the Frenchman. Milan are expected to pay    3m for the loan, while they will have the option to make the transfer permanent for    30m. The two clubs remain in contact as they look to finalise the agreement and iron out the finer details.
