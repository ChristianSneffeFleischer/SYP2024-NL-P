Barcelona have informed Frenkie de Jong that they hope to annul his contract as the terms he was offered by the previous board were illegal. De Jong's future has been the subject of intense speculation this summer. 90min understands that Chelsea have formalised their interest in him in recent days, while Manchester United reached an    85m agreement with Bar  a earlier this summer. That potential move to Old Trafford has been held up by the Dutchman's insistence on being paid around    20m in deferred wages after he agreed to alter his contract during Barcelona's financial struggles in the last couple of years. However, The Athletic now report that Barcelona contacted De Jong in the middle of July to say they found evidence of 'criminality' from both the club and player's side regarding his last contract extension in October 2020. This contract meant that De Jong was tied to the club for a further two years until 2026, but reduced his wages for the 2020/21 and 2021/22 seasons, with the difference being made up in the following four years. Gerard Pique, Marc-Andre ter Stegen and Clement Lenglet signed similar deals. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  &  Sean Walsh  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Chelsea's plans to sign Wesley Fofana.
