Manchester United co-chairman Joel Glazer has insisted that the club will invest 'meaningfully' in the summer transfer window, and is confident about what the future holds for the Red Devils. Man Utd are close to agreeing a deal for Borussia Dortmund's Jadon Sancho, while they have also been linked with moves for Spurs' Harry Kane and West Ham's Declan Rice. Glazer, who United fans seldom hear directly from, confirmed at a recent fans' forum that the club will invest in the playing squad this summer. "We're going to keep investing on the pitch, which we did last year, and we plan on doing it meaningfully this year. So, we feel that we're in a good spot," he said, via Man Utd's website. Glazer also spoke about the restructuring behind the scenes at the club, which involved John Murtough becoming the director of football with Darren Fletcher appointed as technical director, and how he is confident that the club will end their trophy drought. "There's been a tremendous amount of work done behind the scenes and we feel like we're absolutely on the right track," Glazer said. "As you all know, we've put John Murtough as our first football director, along with Darren Fletcher in there as well. And we feel with them together leading the way, and the work done behind the scenes, that we're absolutely on the right track. "Our recruitment process policies, the way we go about it has changed in the last few years, I think we've all seen how that has changed. We think we're absolutely in a position for a lot of success for the future.
