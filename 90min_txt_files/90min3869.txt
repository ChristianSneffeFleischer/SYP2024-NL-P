Barcelona midfielder Miralem Pjanic is heading for Turkey to undergo a medical ahead of a season-long loan to Besiktas. The 31-year-old has found minutes hard to come by under Ronald Koeman, starting just six La Liga games last season and failing to make an appearance so far this year. Barcelona were keen to offload him but could not afford to terminate his expensive contract, which still has three years left to run, so talks were held with clubs across Europe over a possible loan deal. A return to Italy looked to be on the cards, but once the Serie A transfer window closed, Pjanic was forced to consider other options and A Spor revealed on Thursday that a move to Besiktas was now in the works.

Juventus did not want to pay the majority of Pjanic's wages, whereas Barcelona were keen for any buyer to take most of his salary off their hands for at least the next 12 months.
