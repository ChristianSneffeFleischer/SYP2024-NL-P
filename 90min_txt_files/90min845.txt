Chelsea have turned down a  £40m bid from Manchester United for midfielder Mason Mount, sources have confirmed to 90min. Mount has so far refused to extend his contract at Stamford Bridge and is approaching the final 12 months of his deal, with Chelsea prepared to entertain a sale this summer if their asking price of around  £70m is met. United are keen to lure Mount to Old Trafford but do not share Chelsea's valuation of the 24-year-old, given he could leave on a free transfer at the end of the current season. Sources have confirmed to 90min that a  £40m bid from United was submitted to Chelsea but was rejected without hesitation. Chelsea have made their asking price of  £70m clear to United and are prepared to keep Mount beyond the summer if their demands are not met. feed United are expected to return with an improved bid which could be worth closer to  £50m, but the Red Devils are reluctant to go any higher and would need Chelsea to lower their asking price to get a deal over the line. Officials at United believe Chelsea will eventually lower their demands but Blues sources remain adamant that they will not be pressured into selling Mount for a cut-price fee. Incoming Chelsea manager Mauricio Pochettino has made it clear that he wants to keep Mount at Stamford Bridge but no progress has been made over an extension and United are one of a handful of clubs keen to take advantage of the uncertainty. Among Mount's numerous suitors are Arsenal, who have also made contact with Chelsea over forward Kai Havertz. A formal bid from the Gunners for Havertz has not yet been made but, as with United and Mount, there is understood to be a significant disparity in valuation between Chelsea and Arsenal.
