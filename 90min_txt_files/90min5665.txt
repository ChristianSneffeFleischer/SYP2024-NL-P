Veteran defender Diego Godin is set to join fellow Serie A side Cagliari on a free transfer from Inter, allowing the club to finalise a transfer for Arturo Vidal. Godin joined Inter ahead of last season after nine years with Atletico Madrid, but will move to Cagliari as Antonio Conte's side looks to free up funds to bring new faces before the transfer window shuts. Speculation linking Godin to Cagliari has been rumbling on, but transfer guru Fabrizio Romano has confirmed that the move is nearing completion with his signature 'here we go', as initially reported by Sky Italy. Godin has agreed a severance package with Inter that sees his current contract terminated, which has allowed him to agree personal terms with Cagliari. The 34-year-old will sign a three-year deal, and paves the way for Vidal to join the Nerazzurri from Barcelona. Vidal has been one of several players linked with an exit from La Blaugrana following a disappointing season on all fronts. An embarrassing exit to Bayern Munich in the Champions League, coupled up with losing out on La Liga to Real Madrid, prompted Lionel Messi to hand in a transfer request. While the Argentine looks to be staying, a number of his teammates aren't.
