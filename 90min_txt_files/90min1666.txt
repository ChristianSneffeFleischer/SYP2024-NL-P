Manchester City have no intention of allowing Bernardo Silva to leave the club before the January transfer deadline, 90min understands. Silva has been a key player for City throughout most of his time at the club, wining four Premier League titles, an FA Cup, four League Cups and playing in a Champions League final since he arrived from Monaco for  Â£43.5m in the summer of 2017. But, while happy in a footballing sense, the Portugal international has been unsettled off the pitch for a considerable time. He first began    feeling along    during the UK   s first Covid-19 lockdown in 2020 and later asked to leave the club altogether in the summer of 2021. Pep Guardiola admitted last year that Silva    likes Barcelona a lot    and wouldn   t stand in his way if the player wanted to leave, despite stressing that he wants to keep him. The club took a firmer stance. Barcelona have remained interested in Silva and, once the 2022 summer transfer window closed, made him a top target for this year instead. Bar  a president Joan Laporta did only recently rule out spending    80m on Silva, although coach Xavi has said    I love him as a player   .
