Ajax right-back Sergino Dest has indicated he would prefer to move to Bayern Munich this summer, amid interest from Barcelona and Paris-Saint Germain.  The highly rated 19-year-old made 36 appearances in all competitions during the 2019/2020 season, before the Eredivisie campaign was cancelled in April due to COVID-19.  HIs breakout year has caught the attention of several of Europe's top clubs. Though interest in Dest is plentiful, the United States international has expressed his desire to move to Bayern - according to Sky Sports Germany.  "We are told that he spoke in favor of Bavaria," transfer expert Max Bielefeld said. "There are two other clubs, Barcelona and Paris, which are also in the race. But his preference is Bayern."  Die Roten were heavily linked with the Dest back in February, with sources at the time indicating that the two clubs were likely to reach an agreement by the end of the season. Since then, Barcelona and PSG have both joined the race for his signature.  We have to put something straight! ? A post shared by  Sergin  o Dest (@sgd_2) on Feb 21, 2020 at 8:11am PST The Catalan giants view Dest as the ideal replacement for Nelson Semedo, whose contract expires in 2022. Semedo has been courting the interest of the likes of Manchester City and seems unlikely to extend his stay at Camp Nou.  The exchange would appear to be a like for like swap. Not only is he devastating going forward but as a graduate of the famed Ajax youth academy, he would slot in perfectly to Barcelona's possession based style.
