Daniel James isn't thought to be open to leaving Manchester United in January, preferring to stay and fight for his place under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer until at least the summer. James is becoming something of a forgotten figure at Old Trafford, having last featured in the Premier League in October's 0-0 draw with Chelsea. He's started just four matches in all competitions and has played more minutes for Wales this season than he has United. His lack of action has led to understandable speculation over his future, with Leeds - who famously came within a whisker of signing him before United swooped in 2019 - once again in the frame. Understand Daniel James wants to stay at Manchester United beyond the January window, despite Leeds showing interest again. #mufc had summer deadline day approach from #lufc https://t.co/6JUnLWbcVt But the Manchester Evening News say the winger is 'committed' to remaining in Manchester beyond the end of January and is keen to regain his spot.  The MEN also credit Everton with an interest in signing the 23-year-old, and a loan to Brighton has been touted elsewhere. But it's said he is 'enjoying life' under Solskjaer despite his lack of football and will rebuff any offers that come his way. He will hope to feature at some stage against Leeds on Sunday, although it seems Solskjaer has found a winning formula that doesn't include him. Since James last featured in the Premier League, United have won five of their seven matches and are being talked about tentatively as one of many title challengers.
