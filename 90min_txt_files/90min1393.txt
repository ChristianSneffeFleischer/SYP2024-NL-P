Manchester City have reignited their interest in Bayer Leverkusen wonderkid Florian Wirtz, 90min understands. Wirtz is widely regarded as one of European football's brightest prospects, and is back in the German national team fold after recovering from a serious knee ligament injury which sidelined him for nine months and deprived him of a place at the 2022 World Cup. The 19-year-old has long been on City's radar, and sources have confirmed to 90min that the club are again taking a real interest in his progress. City are not alone in their admiration of the player, with Arsenal, Tottenham and Newcastle known to have watched him, and Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund also in the running. The strongest links, however, have seen Wirtz mentioned in dispatches with Barcelona, and he spoke of the Catalan giants' rumoured interest after joining up with Germany ahead of the upcoming international break.

I   m not looking into the future now," he said. Despite the links, German sources have told 90min that Leverkusen do not envisage Wirtz, who is under contract until 2027, leaving this summer, although their stance may alter if they are unable to climb up the Bundesliga table and receive a sizeable offer. One major reason that Leverkusen believe will convince Wirtz to stay is making sure he's part of Hansi Flick's squad for next summer's Euro 2024, which is being hosted in Germany. "I would like to be there [the Euros], to play a good tournament and, above all, to inspire the people in Germany again," Wirtz added to the assembled media. LISTEN NOW
