Wolves have made an offer in the region of    15m for Stade de Reims defender Axel Disasi, who is entering the final year of his contract. The 22-year-old has been subject to interest from Arsenal and Ligue 1 side Rennes, but Wolves have now made an approach for the centre-back, who is expected to leave his current club this summer.

The small price tag reflects the fact that Disasi is only contracted for another year, meaning Reims may be forced to sell him cheap in order to avoid losing him for free next summer. The highly-rated defender has been monitored by a number of clubs, having enjoyed an impressive season as Reims finished sixth in Ligue 1. With the 2019/20 French season being cancelled due to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, clubs have the chance to approach Reims directly and negotiate a move for the young Frenchman. While Wolves have made the bid, they might still face competition in securing Disasi's signature. It was reported last month that Arsenal are also interested in him and have made contact over a potential transfer.
