Ryan Gravenberch has asked Bayern Munich to soften their stance on a potential summer exit, urging the club to listen to any offers which may arrive, 90min understands. The midfielder has been a bit-part figure at the Allianz Arena since signing from Ajax last summer, barely featuring under both Julian Nagelsmann and Thomas Tuchel. Despite dropping down the pecking order, sources have told 90min that Bayern have informed Gravenberch that they do not intend to let him leave as things stand. However, the 20-year-old has in turn demanded that the club at least consider allowing him to pursue a new opportunity following a subpar debut year in Bavaria. Liverpool have been scouring for alternatives to Borussia Dortmund's Jude Bellingham after withdrawing from the race to sign him this summer. READ MORE FROM THE 90MIN TALKING TRANSFERS TEAM feed They are pushing hard to sign Gravenberch either on loan or for a permanent deal which could see Bayern double their money on him - the German champions paid Ajax an initial    18m last summer, with a further    5m in add-ons yet to be paid. The Reds have not been dissuaded by Bayern's current stance as they believe Gravenberch is determined to seek an exit, particularly with Joshua Kimmich and Leon Goretzka currently preferred to him on top of Konrad Laimer joining from RB Leipzig this summer. Arsenal and Manchester United are also keeping an eye on the situation, but his most likely destination at this point appears to be Anfield. LISTEN NOW
