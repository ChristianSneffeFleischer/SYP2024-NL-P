Chelsea winger Pedro will walk away from Chelsea at the end of the season after reaching a total agreement with Serie A side Roma. Roma have been pursuing Pedro for a few weeks and the two parties agreed the initial details of a contract last week, leaving the Spaniard contemplating bringing his season to an abrupt end to protect himself ahead of the move.  Pedro will join AS Roma as a free agent at the end of the season. Total agreement reached - he   s gonna leave Chelsea. Here we go! ??? #Roma #CFC #Chelsea #transfers He had a change of heart and joined Willian in signing a temporary extension to see out the campaign with Chelsea, but Fabrizio Romano notes he has now finalised every aspect of his move to Rome and will leave Stamford Bridge once the campaign comes to a close. For Chelsea, this news hardly comes as a surprise. The 32-year-old has struggled to hold down a regular place in Frank Lampard's starting lineup this year, making just nine appearances in the Premier League. Injuries have disrupted his season, but Lampard has often preferred other options anyway. Callum Hudson-Odoi and Willian have been the boss' preferred pairing, while Christian Pulisic, Mason Mount and even recent returnee Ruben Loftus-Cheek have all had opportunities to impress on the wing. Hakim Ziyech and Timo Werner have already been signed to give Lampard some other options out wide, while the continuing pursuit of Bayer Leverkusen's Kai Havertz would only improve the Blues' attacking depth if successful. For Pedro, now that his Roma move is all but finalised, his focus can remain on finishing the season with Chelsea. He was an unused substitute in the recent 2-1 win over Aston Villa but is expected to see plenty of minutes over the coming months as Chelsea look to hold on to their spot in the top four.
