The agent of Chelsea midfielder Jorginho has confirmed that the Blues have made an offer to extend the Italian's contract, but 90min understands a deal is not yet close to being reached. Jorginho is out of contract at the end of the current season alongside fellow midfielder N'Golo Kante, with the Blues yet to secure either to long-term deals. 90min revealed in October that the duo's futures have been regular topics of discussion in the boardroom at Stamford Bridge, with the decision-makers divided over whether to hand out lucrative new deals to either player. Both Jorginho and Kante are 31, while the latter also has an increasingly concerning injury record to his name, and Chelsea are hesitant to agree to expensive, long-term extensions while new co-owner Todd Boehly eyes a youthful overhaul of the squad. Losing either player on a free transfer would be a blow, however, and Jorginho's agent has confirmed that Chelsea have put an offer on the table for the Italian. "We have a renewal proposal and we give priority to Chelsea," Joao Santos told TMW.  90min understands there is still plenty of distance between Chelsea and Jorginho when it comes to an agreement over a new contract. The Blues are targeting a move for West Ham's Declan Rice in 2023 and have spoken with the agent of Benfica midfielder Enzo Fernandez as they brace themselves for a possible big change in the summer.
