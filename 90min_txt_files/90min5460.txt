Fulham have confirmed the signing of Denmark defender Joachim Andersen on a season-long loan from Lyon. Andersen was highly-rated upon his arrival at the Ligue 1 club last summer but struggled to make an impact in his first year in France. The 24-year-old heads to England looking to pick up regular first-team football, and will be hoping to help the Cottagers recover from a disastrous start to the season.  Andersen told the Fulham website: "I   m really happy to make this move. I   m looking forward to playing in the Premier League and playing for a nice club like Fulham. Late move. ??Good to have you, Joachim Andersen! ?#GreatDane "It   s a league I   ve been following since I was a child and it   s a big, big dream to play in the Premier League, so I   m looking forward to it." Co-owner Tony Khan added: "I   m thrilled to announce the arrival of defender Joachim Andersen to Fulham Football Club on a season-long loan from Olympique Lyonnais.
