Al-Ittihad have confirmed the signing of Karim Benzema from Real Madrid. The Frenchman has been involved in a back-and-forth transfer saga for the last week having previously agreed terms over a new contract at the Santiago Bernabeu. Last week, reports from across Europe and Asia stated that Benzema was considering an offer to join the Saudi Pro League. He initially communicated to Real Madrid club president Florentino Perez that he intended to take up such a lucrative offer, only to change his mind and declare that 'the internet is not reality' in regards to initial reporting.
