Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has explained why the Reds have not made an offer for Jude Bellingham, and insisted he does    not understand    the calls for them to sign a new midfielder this summer. The Merseyside club moved quickly in the transfer market to sign Darwin Nunez from Benfica last month and have also bid farewell to Sadio Mane, now at Bayern Munich. Teenage    Number 10    Fabio Carvalho has come in from Fulham, but things have been relatively unchanged in midfield. There have been rumours about a pursuit of Borussia Dortmund's Bellingham that may not come until 2023 and Klopp has revealed why Liverpool haven't yet made their move. "He   s not on the market, so that   s the first problem with that player," Klopp said. "Well, that   s the only problem with that player!" Klopp went on to vent his frustration at continuing calls for him to bolster Liverpool's midfield ranks, adding: "I do not understand. People told me about this discussion but the last thing that would have crossed my mind is that we have to [sign another midfielder]. "I don   t think something will happen in midfield. You never know, if somebody comes to me and says    I want to go      but nobody came to me yet. If that happens, then we have to talk new. But if the situation stays like it is, then tell me why would we?" Listen now to 90min's Talking Transfers podcast, with  Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey,  Harry Symeou  &  Toby Cudworth.
