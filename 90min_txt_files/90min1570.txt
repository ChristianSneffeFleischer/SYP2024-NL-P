Inter are ready to sell Andre Onana in an attempt to raise funds through the transfer market, 90min understands. The Cameroonian goalkeeper signed for the Nerazzurri on a free transfer from Ajax at the end of the 2021/22 season, and after initially struggling to displace club captain Samir Handanovic, has now become a regular in Simone Inzaghi's side. But since the coronavirus pandemic, Inter have struggled to properly balance the books - an issue which led to the departure of Scudetto-winning manager Antonio Conte in 2021. Sources have told 90min that Inter are hoping to raise around  Â£50m in player sales by the start of July. They had hoped to help reach that number through the sale of Milan Skriniar, but as he is heading to PSG on a free transfer instead, Onana could be on the chopping block. This has alerted clubs such as Chelsea, Manchester United and Tottenham, who are all in the market for new goalkeepers and previously thought that Onana was not an attainable target. 90min reported towards the end of 2021 that Spurs boss Conte was an admirer of Onana as it became clear that he would be leaving Ajax, and Tottenham's interest still remains.
