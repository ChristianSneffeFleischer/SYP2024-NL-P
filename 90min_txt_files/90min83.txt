Real Madrid have sold home-grown attacker Sergio Arribas to fellow La Liga club Almeria. Arribas joined Madrid from the youth system at city neighbours Leganes back in 2012 and gradually rose through the ranks at Valdebebas. The forward made his first-team debut in September 2020 and had played eight senior games by the end of that campaign, combining duties with Real Madrid Castilla. Arribas spent the entirety of 2021/22 with the reserve team, before reappearing for the first-team in 2022/23. He even scored his first goal in the FIFA Club World Cup against Al Ahly of Egypt. With Real Madrid Castilla last season, Arribas scored 18 goals in 34 appearances. Madrid are yet to replace Karim Benzema and have also let Mariano Diaz leave, but 21-year-old Arribas won   t be used to plug the attacking holes in the squad. He has now signed a long-term contract with Almeria until the summer of 2029. In their first top flight campaign since 2015, Almeria narrowly avoided relegation last season.
