Antony has been officially unveiled as a Manchester United player after the    100m deal to bring him in from Ajax was finalised. The Brazil winger was Erik ten Hag's top target to bolster in attack, but negotiations were tough and midway through the window it looked as though United would have to find reinforcements elsewhere, but a renewed effort from the Red Devils finally led to an agreement. Antony has signed a contract until 2027, with United also holding the option to extend by a further year.    This is an incredible moment in my career to be joining one of the most iconic clubs in the world," he said. "I   m thankful to everyone who has believed in me, especially my family, and all my coaches and team-mates, because I could not have got here without them.      Playing under Erik ten Hag at Ajax was perfect for me and my development. His style of football and coaching brings out the best in me, and I am excited by what he has told me about his plans and ambitions in Manchester.    My time at Ajax was fantastic and I will always be grateful for the trust they put in me, but now I am ready for the next challenge, and I can   t wait to join my new team-mates and play my part in bringing success to Manchester United.
