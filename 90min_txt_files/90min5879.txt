Lazio have confirmed striker Ciro Immobile has extended his stay at the club until 2025, as they look to stave off extensive interest in their top scorer's signature.  Immobile has been one of Serie A's top performers in recent seasons, and his 39 goals last season fired them to a surprise title challenge. The Biancocelesti ultimately finished in fourth, five points behind champions Juventus, but Immobile's form attracted a multitude of flattering glances. Bizarrely, he admitted earlier this year that he was even approached about a move to Newcastle...a deal that would almost certainly have hinged on the Saudi Arabia-based takeover that fell through.  .@StefanoDeMart13 a Lazio Style Channel ? @ciroimmobile ha rinnovato il suo contratto con la #SSLazio fino al 2025 ?#CMonEagles ? pic.twitter.com/7CbHhr0MUd Lazio have confirmed, however, that the 30-year-old has signed a two-year extension to his current terms, which were due to expire in 2023.  Since joining Lazio from Sevilla in 2016, Immobile has netted a remarkable 125 goals in 178 appearances, and would have led the line for Italy at Euro 2020 had the tournament not been postponed for 12 months.  The news comes as a blow to Everton, who 90min reported last month wanted to bring the Italian to Goodison Park. The prolific striker is a target of Carlo Ancelotti, who knows him well from his time with Napoli, and was keen to bring him to the Premier League as he looks to rebuild the Merseyside club.
