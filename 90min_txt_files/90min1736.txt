Bournemouth are holding talks with Italian star Nicolo Zaniolo as they hope to persuade him to move to the South Coast, sources have confirmed to 90min. Roma have been in talks with AC Milan and Tottenham Hotspur about a loan deal for the 23-year-old midfielder but, as was the case in the summer, those deals have stalled. Bournemouth made an offer worth    35m on Monday after learning of his potential availability during negotiations with Roma over Uruguay international Matias Vina, but while the Serie A side were happy to accept the bid, Zaniolo was initially unconvinced by the idea of joining a team without European football. The Cherries left their bid on the table, in the hope the player might be persuaded to consider an offer and now 90min understands that Zaniolo instructed his agents on Friday's morning to engage with Bournemouth. Listen now as  Scott Saunders  hosts  Graeme Bailey  and  Toby Cudworth  to discuss the latest transfer news. On today's agenda: Dusan Vlahovic, Anthony Gordon, Enzo Fernandes, Amadou Onana, Malo Gusto, Nicolo Zaniolo, Pedro Porro, Weston McKennie, Milan Skriniar, Maiximo Perrone & more!

Now, Bournemouth are taking to Zaniolo's representatives over a deal which, if they finalised, would represent not only the biggest deal in their history but one of the biggest transfer coups in recent memory. New Cherries owner Bill Foley is pushing hard to back the club during this window and already paid out  Â£20m on Dango Ouattara, while also agreeing a similar size deal for Nicolas Jackson from Villarreal.
