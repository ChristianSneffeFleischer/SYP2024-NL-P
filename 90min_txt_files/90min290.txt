Paris Saint-Germain are aiming to sell Kylian Mbappe this transfer window amid fears he will leave the club for free at the end of his contract next summer, sources have confirmed to 90min. Mbappe informed PSG earlier this summer that he would not extend his deal with the club beyond 2024. Les Parisiens then communicated to the forward that if he does put pen to paper on a new contract, they would explore the option of moving him on in order to recoup a transfer fee. Sources have now told 90min that Mbappe, who returned to pre-season training under new boss Luis Enrique recently, has been told to stay home by PSG ahead of their tour of Japan. Mbappe himself had expected to travel with his teammates out to Asia but the club are now looking to sell him following a frustrating contract standoff. feed Real Madrid have long been seen as Mbappe's top suitors should he leave PSG - he came close to joining them on a free transfer when his previous contract was expiring in 2022 before he had a change of heart - but a move to the Santiago Bernabeu might be difficult to complete immediately. 90min understands that PSG have placed a    200m asking price on Mbappe - a figure which Real Madrid will simply not pay. Los Blancos may consider making a move for Mbappe this summer if this tally is lowered to a figure in the    150m range, but it is more likely that they wait until January to finalise terms on a pre-contract agreement with the forward. Sources have told 90min that Mbappe and his representatives are unmoved by recent developments. They are insistent that he will not be forced out of PSG and will only move to another club when it suits them.
