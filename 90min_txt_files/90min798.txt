Paris Saint-Germain forward Kylian Mbappe has stressed his desire to remain with the club next season and even teased the idea of signing a contract extension to stick around even longer. Mbappe wrote a letter to confirm he would not trigger the one-year extension in his contract, which is due to expire in 2024, and attracted the frustration of his current employers when he tried to explain his decision. It's left PSG forced to consider selling Mbappe this summer before he can walk away for free at the end of the coming campaign, with Real Madrid desperate to finally lure the Frenchman over to the Santiago Bernabeu. Mbappe has previously insisted he is not looking to join Real Madrid this summer and recently reiterated his wish to remain with PSG for the 2023/24 campaign. While an extension currently seems unlikely, Mbappe insisted 'a lot can change' at the club in the coming 12 months, teasing the idea of fresh terms. manual "I have already said before that I   d stay [at PSG]. I have only decided to play at PSG next season," he told Telefoot.  "Many things can happen in a year, especially at a club like PSG." Despite Mbappe's determination, PSG could choose to cash in on the 24-year-old this summer. 90min understands club officials are adamant Mbappe will not be allowed to leave for free and so a summer sale may be their preferred option, although valuing the France forward may not be easy. PSG, understandably, have placed an enormous asking price on Mbappe's head but, given he is approaching the final year of his contract, suitors are reluctant to break the bank just 12 months before he could join for free.
