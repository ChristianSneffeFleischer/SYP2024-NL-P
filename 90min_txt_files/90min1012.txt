Marco Asensio has decided to join Ligue 1 champions Paris Saint-Germain on a free transfer when his contract with Real Madrid expires. The Spain international was a fringe star as a youngster during the Champions League triumphs of 2016/17 and 2017/18. His hauls of 12 goals in all competitions in both 2021/22 and 2022/23 weren't enough to earn him a regular starting spot under manager Carlo Ancelotti and he will leave the Bernabeu this summer for France. 90min revealed back in May Premier League side Aston Villa had offered a contract to the 27-year-old, but agent Jorge Mendes has since told Unai Emery's side that Asensio will instead join a PSG side led by Marquinhos and Kylian Mbappe. Asensio had previously attracted interest from Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester City, Bayern Munich, Juventus and Marseille. feed The former Mallorca star made 285 appearances for Real and scored 61 goals in total, picking up three La Liga titles and three Champions Leagues amid other domestic and European honours. Villa still have their eyes on other wide options in La Liga, however. Barcelona duo Ansu Fati and Ferran Torres - neither of whom made massive contributions to the La Liga title win - have also been identified as potential alternatives. News of Asensio's imminent arrival at Parc des Princes comes soon after it was confirmed by manager Christophe Galtier that Lionel Messi will leave the Ligue 1 champions when his contract expires this summer.
