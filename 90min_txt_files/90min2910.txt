Chelsea have made contact with Brighton over a deal for versatile defender Marc Cucurella, 90min can confirm. The Blues are looking for at least two further defensive additions following the arrival of Kalidou Koulibaly and have been in talks with Leicester to discuss Wesley Fofana, who has a huge  £80m price tag. Now, sources have confirmed to 90min that contact has been made between Chelsea and Cucurella, whose ability to play as both a left-sided centre-back and a left-back will undoubtedly appeal to Blues boss Thomas Tuchel. Brighton are looking to hold on to Cucurella and they have made it clear to suitors that the 24-year-old will not be allowed to leave for anything less than his  £50m price tag - a figure which has seen talks with Manchester City stall. City have offered  £40m but saw that proposal knocked back by Brighton, and the Premier League champions are yet to increase their bid, instead examining other possible targets. With City's negotiations stalling, Chelsea have reached out to both Brighton and Cucurella over the possibility of a deal, with the Seagulls again reiterating their  £50m price tag. Chelsea have explored possible ways to drive that sum down, including the idea of sending young centre-back Levi Colwill in the other direction as a makeweight, but exchanging players is not thought to be essential for Chelsea to pursue a deal.
