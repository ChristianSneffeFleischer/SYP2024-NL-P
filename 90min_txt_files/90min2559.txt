Bayer Leverkusen sporting director Simon Rolfes has laughed off reports the Bundesliga side could move for Inter left-back Robin Gosens before the transfer deadline. Numerous reports emerged earlier this week suggesting Bayer were readying a loan bid for Gosens which would include an obligation to buy and perhaps even a move in the opposite direction for 22-year-old Mitchel Bakker. The rumours made their way to Rolfes, who wasted little time in shooting them down. "There is no offer from Bayer, and there is no intention to buy him," Rolfes told K  lner Stadt-Anzeiger. Rolfes also accused Inter of spreading the speculation in an attempt to drum up interest in the German, whose agent recently claimed to Radio Radio that there was a '60% chance' that Gosens would end up with Bayer. 28-year-old Gosens has managed 11 appearances for Inter since joining on an initial loan in January, with a hamstring injury limiting both his involvement and his impact at San Siro.
