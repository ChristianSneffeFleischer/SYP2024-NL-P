Roma are said to be ready to step up their efforts to keep hold of Chris Smalling at the club as they prepare a new offer for the central defender.  When Smalling was shipped out on loan by Manchester United to Roma at the start of the season, few would have expected the move to be so beneficial to all parties involved. Yet, the Englishman has been a key figure at the back for I Giallorossi in 2019/20.

Gazzetta dello Sport (via Sport Witness) now report that the Serie A outfit are ready to step up their efforts to keep hold of Smalling by preparing another offer.  The Red Devils are said to be looking for around    20m for his services - a fee which Roma have so far proven unwilling to pay. Sport Witness point towards a previous Gazzetta dello Sport report which notes that Roma were ready to table an offer of    3m for another season-long loan, with a purchase clause set at    15m - which would be paid in three different instalments.  However, the report claims they will now put forward a    17m package to Man Utd in an attempt to convince them to part ways with Smalling. This would involve another    3m payment for another loan, as well as a payment of    14m which Roma would pay in 2021 in one go. Smalling's agent is said to have travelled to Rome to hold talks with the club in an attempt to work out 'how to move' for next season.
