AC Milan have completed the signing of Norwegian starlet Jens Petter Hauge from Bod  /Glimt on a permanent deal. The 20-year-old winger forced his way into the global spotlight this summer with his performances in the Europa League qualifying stages, which saw Hauge bag a goal and an assist against Milan themselves.
