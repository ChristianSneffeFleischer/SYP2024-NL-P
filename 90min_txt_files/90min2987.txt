Fulham are finally set to announce the signing of Kevin Mbabu from Wolfsburg, 90min understands.  Signing a right-back has been a priority for the Cottagers all summer and after seeing their top target Neco Williams join Nottingham Forest, they turned their attention to Mbabu.  Despite interest on both sides, negotiations have been tricky with the two clubs eventually agreeing a deal worth an initial  Â£6m, though this could increase with add-ons. As reported by 90min, Mbabu was booked in for a medical in West London on Thursday and after passing these tests, he should be unveiled as a Fulham player early next week. The defender made 31 appearances in all competitions for Wolfsburg last season and may feel he has unfinished business in England, having failed to make the grade at Newcastle United.  Mbabu will become Fulham's third signing of the transfer window, after Andreas Pereira and Joao Palhinha.
