Lyon striker Moussa Dembele is reportedly the subject of interest from West Ham United. Dembele moved to Ligue 1 in the summer of 2018 after two trophy-laden seasons in Scotland with Celtic for a fee in the region of  Â£20m. The 24-year-old striker surpassed 20 goals in each of his first two campaigns with Lyon, but is yet to open his account this season after 11 appearances. ?? @OL @dembelition pic.twitter.com/CHwAgGBgT9 The former France under-21 international has only scored twice across all competitions since the French top flight was halted and ultimately cut short in March due to the coronavirus pandemic. Both of his post-lockdown goals came in Lyon's surprise Champions League quarter-final victory against Manchester City in August. Despite his lack of playing time, Dembele has attracted attention from a number of clubs, with David Moyes' West Ham among the ever-growing list of suitors, according to France Football (via TEAMtalk). This latest development supports the claims from earlier this month that the east London club were thought to be tracking Dembele, with Lyon willing to sell. Lyon may have reached last season's Champions League semi-finals, but Les Gones failed to qualify for any European competition after a lowly seventh-place finish in the shortened 2019/20 campaign. The club's legendary former player and current sporting director Juninho Pernambucano admitted last summer that 'there will be departures', hinting that Dembele may be among them.
