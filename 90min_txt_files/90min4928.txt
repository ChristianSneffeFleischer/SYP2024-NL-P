Misfiring Real Madrid frontman Luka Jovic has completed a loan move back to former club Eintracht Frankfurt. The Serbia international has endured a torrid time since his move to the Spanish capital in 2019. In  32 appearances in all competitions for Los Blancos he's mustered just two goals and has subsequently fallen well down the pecking order under Zinedine Zidane.  #JovicIsBack ? pic.twitter.com/4x1XY335KW Jovic has been deemed surplus to requirement at Santiago Bernabeu - despite signing for the club just 18 months ago in a deal worth over  Â£50m - and it has now been confirmed that the 23-year-old has completed a move back to his former side Eintracht Frankfurt. The German club took to their official website to confirm Jovic had signed a loan deal until the end of the season and would be handed the number nine jersey. The frontman enjoyed a prolific spell with the Bundesliga outfit between 2017-2019, with his second season in particular catching the eye of some of Europe's biggest clubs. Jovic notched 27 goals in 48 games for Frankfurt in 2018/19 , with his fine form enough to secure a move to Madrid. However, he never really settled in La Liga following his big-money move and numerous injury setbacks haven't helped his cause. The Serbian international has made just four league appearances this season - two of which have come from the bench.
