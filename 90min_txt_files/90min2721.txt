Manchester City's stance on selling Bernardo Silva has not changed and they have no desire to allow him to leave the club this summer. The 28-year-old has been linked with a move to Barcelona in recent weeks, despite the Catalan giants' financial woes, but 90min confirmed earlier this month that City have no interest in negotiating a transfer. Atletico Madrid have been tipped as another potential landing spot for Silva, while Ligue 1 champions Paris Saint-Germain are also rumoured to be interested in signing the Portuguese international. Silva recently admitted that there was a degree of uncertainty about future, despite being happy at the Etihad Stadium, and it's believed that he would ultimately like to join Barcelona at some stage. Nevertheless, City have been quick to remind Silva and his representatives that he only signed a new long-term deal in March - and sources have again stressed to 90min that the club's hierarchy, led by former Barca stalwarts Txiki Begiristain and Ferran Soriano, have no intention of selling. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  &  Toby Cudworth  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Erik ten Hag wanting to sign five players before the transfer window closes, and Man Utd's attitude to selling Cristiano Ronaldo. Available on  all audio platforms  and the  90min YouTube channel. If you can't see the podcast embed, click  here  to download the episode in full! Speaking ahead of Wednesday's charity friendly with Barcelona at Camp Nou, which will raise money for research into treating ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), Pep Guardiola joked to Catalan Radio that Barca's fans will get to see Silva play - but should get used to the fact that he will be in a City shirt.
