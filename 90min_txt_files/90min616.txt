Moises Caicedo   s agent has declared that    nothing has yet been done    with regard to a transfer out of Brighton amid interest from Chelsea and Manchester United. Arsenal had been keen on Caicedo in January but are now close to securing what will be a British record  £105m transfer for Declan Rice. That price point has influenced Brighton   s valuation of their 21-year-old Ecuadorean star, although that is an overall figure rather than an up-front sum. Chelsea were already close to agreeing personal terms with Caicedo earlier this month, but concerns over Brighton   s asking price has since led them to explore alternatives as well. 90min understands that Manchester United have more recently made contact with Caicedo   s agent, Manuel Sierra, and had considered the player an alternative to Mason Mount after struggling to come to an agreement with Chelsea over the England midfielder. feed United have, however, since finally struck a deal for Mount worth  £55m plus  £5m in add-ons. Using Ecuadorean outlet El Universo as a mouthpiece, Sierra has denied local reports and those in Spain that proceedings regarding Caicedo are at any sort of advanced stage. The publication carries no direct quotes from the agent but claims to have been informed by him that suggestions a deal could be reached in the coming days are not true. He did, however, suggest that the situation will become    clearer    with each passing day.
