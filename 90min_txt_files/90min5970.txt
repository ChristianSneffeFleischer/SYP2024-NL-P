As a Championship club, it's tough to keep the Premier League vultures from circling around your top talents; something Queens Park Rangers have found out this summer. After a stellar 2019/20 campaign, highly rated attacking midfielder Eberechi Eze looks destined to leave Loftus Road, with a whole host of top-tier sides said to be keen on signing the youngster. Eze's 14 goals and eight assists last campaign for QPR saw him named the club's Players' Player and Supporters' Player of the season, and with pastures new seemingly on the horizon, the 22-year-old has already spoken of his desire to one day play Champions League football. So, with the attacking midfielder harbouring lofty ambitions, 90min takes a look at the sides reportedly interested in acquiring his services, and discuss the suitability of each of his potential suitors. If Newcastle are to push on and avoid any future relegation scares then their squad undoubtedly needs some work, however, their attacking midfield options are relatively healthy.With Miguel Almiron slowly beginning to find his feet on Tyneside and Allan Saint-Maximin enjoying a fine debut season at the club, Newcastle have far more pressing matters than to add another creative wide man to their roster.Because of this, it's difficult to see Eze being afforded a place in the starting XI, and without a prolific frontman to supply to, the QPR man's creativity wouldn't be fully appreciated at St. James' Park.Newcastle are a long way away from being able to match Eze's ambitions, and a move to the north east wouldn't make a lot of sense for the youngster.Suitability Rating: 2/10 Tottenham experienced issues when registering their European squad last season, with Victor Wanyama and Juan Foyth forced to miss out due to the club not having enough homegrown first-team players.The signing of Joe Hart may have been partially driven by this, and their reported interest in Eze could have a similar motive.Jose Mourinho's squad is well stocked with international attacking midfielders, and while Spurs may soon be able to provide the Champions League football Eze craves, the 22-year-old would struggle for game time.A move to Spurs could result in precious wasted years in the youngster's career, and he'll do well to not be lured by the bright lights.Suitability Rating: 3/10 Another big London club with Eze on their radar.Similarly to Spurs, Arsenal may be closer to Champions League football than some of the other sides in this list, though their attacking midfield options are solid, with Willian recently brought in to add to their current crop.The Gunners are potentially embarking on exciting times, with Mikel Arteta promising a rebuild of the squad - with many young stars involved. However, a move to the Emirates Stadium would be a big gamble for Eze.The QPR man would be much better advised to find a Premier League side where he knows he can expect regular first-team football and then push on from there.Suitability Rating: 4/10 If there's one thing Eze would be assured of at Aston Villa it's a place in the starting XI.Dean Smith's side were far too reliant on the creativity of Jack Grealish last season, and the Villa captain desperately needs a teammate to shoulder some of the burden with him.However, Villa's style of play is far from expansive - notching just over a goal-per-game last season - and Eze has proven to be at his best when in a team that expresses itself and plays with freedom.While a move to Villa Park would bring valuable Premier League experience, the club are unlikely to offer the platform Eze needs to showcase his talent in the top tier.Suitability Rating: 5/10 With the future of  Â£40m man Felipe Anderson up in the air, West Ham could well be in the market for a creative midfielder.The Hammers have got previous when it comes to plucking attacking midfielders from the second tier, with former Hull City player Jarrod Bowen signing for the club in January, and the young winger has been afforded plenty of opportunities in the starting XI.Bowen's move to West Ham is proof that David Moyes is keen to give young, exciting talent a chance, though Eze's chances of first-team football could be dependant on whether the club part ways with the likes of Anderson and Manuel Lanzini this summer.Suitability Rating: 5/10 The average age of Crystal Palace's starting XI was the oldest in the Premier League last season, something Roy Hodgson seems keen to address.Similarly to West Ham, Palace's interest in Eze could be dependant on the future of one of their high-profile players, with speculation yet again beginning to mount regarding Wilfried Zaha.Should the Ivory Coast international move on, Selhurst Park could look an attractive destination for Eze.The QPR man would fit into Hodgson's current system, and a move across London would make a lot of sense geographically if nothing else.However, creativity has proved a big issue for Palace, and Eze should be mindful of the pressure he would be under to produce should Zaha move on.Suitability Rating: 7/10
