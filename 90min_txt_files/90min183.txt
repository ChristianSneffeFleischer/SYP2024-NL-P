Bayern Munich CEO Jan-Christian Dreesen and technical director Marco Neppe are due in England on Monday for their next meeting with Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy to discuss the future of Harry Kane, 90min understands. After holding a meeting with Levy earlier this month, Bayern had planned for a second set of face-to-face talks with the Spurs chairman last week but saw those plans pushed back at the last minute. Now, the two Bayern officials are expected to front a group of Bayern representatives which will touch down in London on Monday for their long-awaited talks over Kane's future. Two bids from Bayern have already been knocked back by Levy who, up to this point, has not named an asking price or even given any indication that he would be prepared to accept a bid for his talismanic striker this summer. However, with Kane entering the final year of his contract, Spurs owner Joe Lewis has intervened and is understood to have told Levy to authorise a sale if an agreement to extend Kane's contract cannot be struck. feed A club-record bid from Bayern, whose transfer record currently stands at the    80m paid to sign Lucas Hernandez from Atletico Madrid in 2019, is expected to arrive imminently, with the German side determined to take advantage of Kane's expiring contract to get a deal done. There has been plenty of speculation over the reason for the cancellation of last week's meeting between Bayern and Spurs but the German side's president, Herbert Hainer, insisted there was nothing malicious going on. "Sometimes people read too much into normal processes," Hainer told TZ. "What I can say is that Daniel Levy is a professional. We all have the utmost respect for him."
