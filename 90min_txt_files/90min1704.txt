Nottingham Forest are in talks to add Jonjo Shelvey and Felipe to their squad before Tuesday   s transfer deadline, 90min understands. Forest are keen to strengthen their ranks for the second half of the season with Premier League survival very much within their grasp.  It has been clear for some time that Shelvey   s days at Newcastle have been numbered and Besitkas were keen to take him to Turkey. He was not keen on the move, though, and sees extending his Premier League career with Forest as a much better option.  The former Liverpool midfielder is out of contract in the summer and he has been restricted to just a handful of appearances this season due to injuries.  On this edition of The Promised Land, Scott Saunders & Rob Blanchette discuss how to solve Man Utd   s issue at centre-forward & Ten Hag   s striker plans. The guys talk Wout Weghorst, the fact Jo Â£o Felix is no longer on the market, Victor Osimhen, Harry Kane, Benjamin Sesko & more!If you can   t see this embed, click here to listen to the podcast!
