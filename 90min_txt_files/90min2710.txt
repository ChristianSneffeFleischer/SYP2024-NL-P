Nottingham Forest have completed the signing of Wolverhampton Wanderers midfielder Morgan Gibbs-White for a club-record fee. The 22-year-old has signed a five-year deal at the City Ground and will wear the number 10 shirt for his new club. 90min understands that the deal could be worth close to  £45m if all bonus payments and future incentives are coughed up, with the initial fee to take Gibbs-White to the Premier League new boys in the region of  £25m. The England Under-21 international reunites with Steve Cooper having worked under him during his days as England-Under 17 manager. The pair lifted the FIFA Under-17 World Cup together in October 2017 and also spent time together during Gibbs-White's loan spell at Swansea.
