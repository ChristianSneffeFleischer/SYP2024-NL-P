Barcelona are keeping tabs on Valencia full-back Jose Gaya as they look to line up a long-term successor to Jordi Alba. Spain international Alba has been a mainstay of the Bar  a starting XI since his arrival at Camp Nou in 2012 and has enjoyed a trophy-laden spell at the club. The left-back boasts no fewer than five Spanish titles as well as four Copa del Rey triumphs and one Champions League. However, with the 31-year-old entering the twilight of his career, journalist Xavi Campos (via Onze) claims Barcelona are eyeing up a potential move for Gaya, with a    15m ( Â£13.3m) move mooted to be in the offing. A product of the Valencia youth system, Gaya has cemented his place on the left-hand side of their defence since being promoted to the senior side in 2013. The 25-year-old was handed the captain's armband at the beginning of the 2020/21 season and is rivalling Alba for the left-back spot in the Spanish national team. Bar  a's interest in Gaya has raised further speculation regarding the future of Junior Firpo. The 24-year-old is said to have been deemed surplus to requirements at Camp Nou, with both West Ham and Milan lodging an interest in the full-back. And it may well be that Barcelona are forced to sell Firpo before they can sanction any arrivals at the club.
