Manchester United are resigned to selling Sergio Romero in January for a fraction of his asking price from last summer's transfer window. Romero has been at United for five years now, having been signed by former manager Louis Van Gaal from Sampdoria, but has failed to establish himself as the Red Devils' first-choice goalkeeper, and made only 17 appearances last season. Though Romero found himself further down the pecking order last summer after Dean Henderson's return from his loan at Sheffield United, no club was able to match the  £5m asking price for the Argentine, whose wife reacted angrily on social media to United's inability to move him on. It now looks, however, as if United could make a move away from Old Trafford much easier for Romero by significantly reducing their valuation of the stopper, according the Mirror. With Romero now no longer featured in Ole Gunner Solskjaer's squad for either the Premier League or Champions League, United will now accept  £2.5m for him, exactly half of what they were requesting last summer. Though Romero's contract is currently set to run out in the summer of 2021, United have an option to extend his deal by another year, which they are prepared to trigger in order to recoup a fee for the 33-year-old keeper. Both Leeds and Everton were known to be interested in Romero last summer, although whether the Toffees will still retain that interest after signing Robin Olsen as competition for Jordan Pickford remains to be seen.
