Liverpool have reportedly identified Udinese midfielder Rodrigo De Paul as a key target in the summer transfer window, as the Reds plan to freshen things up following a disappointing Premier League title defence during the 2020/21 season. Jurgen Klopp's side ran away with the league title during the 2019/20 campaign as they were crowned champions of England for the first time in 30 years, but a spate of injuries and a downturn in form has put paid to their title defence. With Georginio Wijnaldum poised to depart the club for nothing at the end of June following the expiration of his contract, another central midfield addition will likely be a priority for the Reds in a potential summer rebuild. According to Sport Mediaset (via Sport Witness), Klopp is a big fan of De Paul, and has identified the Udinese man as 'key' to rebuilding his side. The Argentinian midfielder - a target of Premier League rivals Leeds during the 2020 window - will demand a substantial transfer fee, with Udinese holding out for at least    40m if they are to part company with their talisman. De Paul put pen to paper on a new contract with the Serie A outfit in 2019, with his current deal running until 2024.
