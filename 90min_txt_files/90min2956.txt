American striker Matthew Hoppe is in advanced talks regarding a transfer from Mallorca to English Championship club Middlesbrough, 90min understands. The 21-year-old only signed for Los Piratas back in August 2021 following FC Schalke's relegation from the Bundesliga. Despite the German side's struggles, Hoppe enjoyed a breakout in the Gelsenkirchen with five goals in his first seven senior appearances and six strikes in 22 games across the entire 2020/21. That was enough to tempt  La Liga  side Mallorca to part with    3.5m for his services. Since then, however, Hoppe has struggled, making just seven appearances, notching one assist but still awaiting his first goal.

As revealed by 90min, clubs from across Europe had been showing interest in taking Hoppe on loan, should the forward wish to leave Mallorca in order to secure more minutes and boost his chances of making the USMNT's World Cup roster. Talks between Hoppe and Mallorca had initially been going well, but it's become clear recently that the player would have to leave the club if he is going to get regular playing time.  90min sources say that despite sustained interest across Europe and from a number of MLS sides, Middlesbrough have now entered advanced talks with Mallorca over a permanent deal.  It's understood that there's a great desire from Hoppe to get the deal done, with his primary motivation not only doing enough to convince Gregg Berhalter to take him to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, but to show he can provide the Stars and Stripes with cutting edge in front of goal.
