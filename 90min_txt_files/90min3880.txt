Paris Saint-Germain have completed their extraordinary summer of transfer business with the signing of Sporting CP prospect Nuno Mendes on an initial loan. The left-back has joined Les Parisiens for a    7m loan fee, with an option to buy for    40m on a five-year contract which the French giants are likely to trigger next summer.       ? #WelcomeNunoMendes      ? #?????????? pic.twitter.com/gMmvwBlJy7 The 19-year-old enjoyed a breakthrough season last term with Sporting, making 35 appearances and earning a place in Portugal's squad for Euro 2020. Mendes agreed personal terms with PSG earlier on Tuesday and the deal has been announced ahead of the 11pm transfer deadline. The structure of the agreement is the same as the deal that saw the Ligue 1 runners-up sign Danilo Pereira permanently this summer following an initial loan from Sporting's Liga NOS rivals Porto. Comfortable on the ground or in the air, the teenager played an enormous part in Sporting's keeping of the best defensive record in Liga NOS last season. Ruben Amorim's champions shipped just 20 goals in 34 games, and very few of them came down Mendes' side.
