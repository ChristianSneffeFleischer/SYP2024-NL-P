PSG manager Christophe Galtier has admitted he cannot definitively rule out a bid for Inter centre-back Milan Skriniar before the end of the transfer window. Skriniar was among PSG's top targets earlier this summer and Inter were prepared to sell to fund their own transfer plans, but the two sides failed to agree on a fee for the 27-year-old and a move looked to have collapsed. PSG have not yet signed another defender, despite limited options for Galtier's preferred 3-4-3 formation, and some fans have called on the Ligue 1 side to reignite their pursuit of Skriniar before Thursday's deadline. Asked whether such a move was a possibility, Galtier told a press conference: "I can't tell you [the pursuit of Skriniar] is completely over. There are always surprises in the transfer window. "Skriniar has been a target for a long time. Negotiations with Inter are very difficult and you have to respect their position. "But anything is possible."
