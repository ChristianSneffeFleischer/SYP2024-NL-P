Liverpool look set to keep hold of defender Joel Matip this summer despite reported interest from Ligue 1 giants Paris Saint-Germain. The Reds have already sold centre-back Dejan Lovren for  Â£11m to Zenit Saint Petersburg, and are said to be unwilling to let another defender go this summer. Despite a lack of gametime last season, Matip was instrumental in Liverpool's Champions League triumph of two seasons ago - helping the Reds keep a clean sheet in the final.  Recent reports from the Football Terrace podcast saw the Cameroon international linked with Ligue 1 champions Paris Saint-Germain, but the Liverpool Echo's Paul Gorst has denied these rumours.  "No. Liverpool won't allow Matip to leave right now. The club only have three senior centre-backs and losing him would leave them with just VVD and Gomez. It's a non-starter. Matip was injured a lot last season but he is a good centre-back when fit and ready." He said when answering a fan's question regarding the link. The defender made just13 appearances for the Reds during the 2019/20 season - largely due to injury - but he's been a reliable performer when called upon since his arrival on a free transfer back in 2017. Matip's high level of performances, coupled with the fact that Liverpool are expected to be working with a tight budget during the summer transfer window due to COVID-19, the Reds are not expected let many more players leave this summer - especially not ones like Matip who are considered to be valuable squad members moving forward.
