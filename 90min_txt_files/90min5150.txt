Newcastle, as well as a number of other Premier League clubs, have been offered the chance to re-sign Schalke outcast Nabil Bentaleb. The Algerian spent the second half of last season on loan at St James' Park and had been tipped to complete a permanent move in the summer.  High wage demands, combined with the logistical complexities surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, prevented a deal from happening, but Bentaleb has again been frozen out by Schalke and told he has no future at the club. A post shared by Nabil Bentaleb (@nabilbentaleb) Bentaleb recently took to Instagram to hit out at rumours surrounding the nature of his exile, and theChronicle now report that he is available for little to no fee - with Schalke expecting a departure by the end of the season at the latest. The report states that Bentaleb is looking to engineer a move back to the Premier League, hence why Newcastle have been touted as one of the clubs in with a chance of bringing him back for a second spell. The Magpies are expected to be on the hunt for loan signings in January, although it is unclear whether or not they will actually look to revive their interest. Manager Steve Bruce is known to want further reinforcements who can make an immediate impact, and although he's a known fan of Bentaleb, the fact that money is available to spend may see him pursue other options.
