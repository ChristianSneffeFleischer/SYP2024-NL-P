Barcelona's transfer strategy in recent years has involved a wheel of fortune style game where they spin the wheel and whichever player it lands on they go and sign. Well, it seems they might actually have opted for a different approach of late, with manager Ronald Koeman apparently using, wait for it...logic. The Bar  a boss was recently offered the chance to sign two new players by the club's scouting team - an offer which usually signals the beginning of a protracted transfer saga that only comes to an end once the La Liga giants have agreed a world-record transfer fee and their new man has penned a 23-year deal. However, in a shocking turn of events, Koeman has turned down the chance to sign the two new players, with the Dutchman providing real life reasons as to why they wouldn't be a good fit at the club - we're not sure he understands his role. Atalanta's Cristian Romero and Lille's Renato Sanches were both recently pinpointed by club officials as players who could be of use to the team next season, but according to Rac1 (via Sport) Koeman has turned down the opportunity to add the pair to his squad. Romero has been heavily linked with a move to Tottenham over the past few weeks as Nuno Espirito Santo and Fabio Paratici look to strengthen their backline, but Koeman believes recent arrival Eric Garcia is a very similar player and as such the signing would be unnecessary.
