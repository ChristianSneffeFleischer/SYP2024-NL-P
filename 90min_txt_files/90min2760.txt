Sources indicate that Everton are still to agree a fee with the French giants for Gueye's signature. The midfielder has agreed to lower his wages in order to return to Merseyside, but he is seeking compensation from PSG to do so which Everton are unwilling to contribute towards. The Toffees have already secured the signing of Amadou Onana from Lille this summer in a deal worth over  £30m, with James Tarkowski and Conor Coady having also arrived to strengthen the defensive ranks.
