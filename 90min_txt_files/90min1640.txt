Southampton have completed the signing of Ghanaian winger Kamaldeen Sulemana from Rennes for a club-record fee. The Saints have been active in January after finding themselves bottom of the Premier League, having struck deals for midfielder Carlos Alcaraz, winger Mislav Orsic and full-back James Bree already this winter. The next player through the door is Sulemana, for whom Southampton are understood to have agreed a club-record fee worth around  Â£22m.    This is another really positive addition for us this month," said manager Nathan Jones. "We   ve obviously been keen to add a little more potency to the side, and Kamaldeen is someone who does that for us.     He   s at a stage in his career where we feel he can help us in the immediate term, but also continue to grow and develop further into the future.
