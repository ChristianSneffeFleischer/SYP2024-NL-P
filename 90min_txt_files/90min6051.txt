Andreas Pereira is ready to end his nine-year stay at Old Trafford this summer, having been dissatisfied with his playing time. Pereira, who signed a new four-year contract last season, has made 40 appearances for the Red Devils this season, scoring twice. However, since the restart and the subsequent return of Paul Pogba to the starting lineup, the 24-year old has played just 62 minutes in all competitions and is seeking a move away from Manchester in this summer's transfer window, according to Esporte Interativo. The Brazilian site report that Solskjaer wants Pereira to stay, but the midfielder has already made his mind up, with his agent making contact with clubs in Portugal, Spain, and Germany. Pereira has previous experience playing in La Liga, spending two years out on loan at Granada and Valencia. It was at the former where he enjoyed his best goalscoring season, netting five times in 35 league appearances. Should the player wish to stay in England, he will not lack options, with Everton, West Ham and Newcastle all reportedly showing interest. A move to West Ham could see Pereira reunite with former boss David Moyes, who was in charge at Old Trafford while the Brazilian was in the Under-21s.  Should he complete a transfer to Everton, he will face stiff competition for a starting place. The Toffees already have Fabian Delph, Tom Davies, Gylfi Sigurdsson, Andre Gomes, and Jean-Philippe Gbamin competing for central midfield spots.  However, a summer transfer for Pereira could depend on Man Utd's incomings during this window.
