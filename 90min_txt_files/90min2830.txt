Sevilla have completed the signing of Isco on a two-year deal after he was released by Real Madrid. The playmaker spent nine seasons in the Spanish capital following a high-profile move from Malaga. While he won everything on offer to him in nearly a decade at the Santiago Bernabeu, he never quite reached the heights expected of him on an individual level. He was often linked with a move away from Real during the latter half of his tenure, with the likes of Manchester City, Tottenham and Arsenal touted with an interest. Following the expiration of his contract at the end of June, Italian side Fiorentina were said to be eyeing a deal. But Isco has put pen to paper on a two-year contract with Sevilla, returning to his home region of Andalusia. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  &  Sean Walsh  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Chelsea's plans to sign Wesley Fofana. There's the latest on James Maddison, Jamie Vardy, Cristiano Ronaldo and Frenkie de Jong, and chat on Diogo Jota's new deal and Roberto Firmino's Liverpool future.
