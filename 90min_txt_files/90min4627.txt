Manchester City are keeping tabs on Denis Zakaria, with the Borussia Monchengladbach midfielder touted as a potential replacement for Fernandinho. Fernandinho has been an integral part of Manchester City's trio of Premier League title victories since joining the club from Shakhtar Donetsk in 2013, but has only featured in half of his side's top-flight matches this term.  The 35-year-old's contract expires in the summer, and although Pep Guardiola has suggested that there is still time for him to extend his stay at the Etihad, this would just be a short-term option and City will at some point be on the hunt for a defensive midfield successor.

The 24-year-old has 18 months remaining on his deal with the Bundesliga outfit, and the Manchester Evening News quote a figure of  Â£40m should City wish to prise Zakaria away from Gladbach. The Swiss international has made 17 Bundesliga appearances for Gladbach this season, having seen the start of his campaign disrupted by a knee injury.  He has previously been linked with the likes of Liverpool, Chelsea, Manchester United and Bayern Munich. The latter trio were all reportedly tracking Zakaria in October of 2020, with Liverpool's interest dating back to March of last year.
