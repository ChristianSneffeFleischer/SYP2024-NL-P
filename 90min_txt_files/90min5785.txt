Leicester have joined the race to sign Brentford defender Rico Henry, rivalling Leeds, Aston Villa, Brighton and West Brom for the left back's signature. Henry was a key cog in Thomas Frank's slick Brentford side who narrowly missed out on automatic promotion following an end of season stutter. The Bees subsequently lost to Fulham in the play-off final, and now risk losing some of their prized assets to the Premier League. Ollie Watkins, Said Benrahma, David Raya and Bryan Mbeumo have all been linked with moves away, in addition to Henry. According to the Daily Express (via the Leicester Mercury), Leicester are keen on a move for the 23-year-old this summer, with Brentford looking for a fee in the region of  £7m. However, due to Henry attracting interest from such a plethora of top flight sides, the Bees could hold out for  £10m. The Foxes did find themselves short in the left back department following the  £50m sale of Ben Chilwell to Chelsea, but they have since signed Timothy Castagne from Atalanta  to fill the void left by the England international. Leicester also have the experienced Christian Fuchs and talented teenager Luke Thomas already in their ranks, meaning the left back position is now not necessarily an urgent area to address. The Foxes are not the sole admirers of Henry in the Premier League. Brighton and newly-promoted Leeds and West Brom have all been linked with a move for the former Walsall man.
