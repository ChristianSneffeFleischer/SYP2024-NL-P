Premier League champions Manchester City are preparing an approach for Sporting's Nuno Mendes.  The left-back has been a huge part of the club's success this season having helped the Lisbon=based club to their first Liga NOS title in 19 years.  At 18 years old, Mendes is regarded as one of European football's brightest young talents and according to A Bola, the Manchester-based outfit are planning to bring him to the Etihad Stadium this summer. The Portuguese outlet claim initial discussions have already taken place between City's representatives and those of the Liga NOS winners but a formal bid is yet to be made. It's said that the Premier League club plan to take their interest further after the upcoming Champions League final. Pep Guardiola and Txiki Begiristain are said to be huge admirers of the defender and are set on negotiating a transfer ahead of the 2021/22 campaign.
