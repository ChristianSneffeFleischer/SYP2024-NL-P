Barcelona could make an approach for Manchester United midfielder Donny van de Beek in January following the player   s recent change of agent. Van de Beek   s United future has grown increasingly uncertain this season. Far from getting more chances after working hard on a physical training programme during the summer, the Netherlands international has remained a peripheral figure, much to his frustration. He has only played six minutes of Premier League football all season, while he was substituted at half-time against Young Boys in the Champions League in one of his only two starts. In his sole other start this season, United were knocked out of the Carabao Cup by West Ham. Everton were interested in the former Ajax star during the summer but United resisted a sale. Van de Beek has now changed his agent, splitting with Guido Albers and taking on Ali Dursun. That decision is rumoured to have come about following discussions with some of his United teammates, who urged him to make the switch in order to better resolve his situation. Dursun already represents Van de Beek   s former Ajax colleague Frenkie de Jong and SPORT has reported that his relationship with De Jong and now with Dursun could pave the way for Barcelona to make an approach in the winter window. The Catalans are known to be looking for a midfielder who can get forward and support the attack, having missed out on Georginio Wijnaldum in the summer when he chose PSG instead. Bar  a were already linked with Van de Beek in early October, as well as keeping tabs on Tanguy Ndombele, Marcelo Brozovic and Franck Kessie to address their midfield needs.
