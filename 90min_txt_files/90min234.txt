Manchester United have made an offer worth  £51.4m for Atalanta striker Rasmus Hojlund, 90min understands. United's offer is worth    50m ( £42.8m, $55.4m) plus an additional    10m ( £8.6m, $11m) in add-ons, though it's understood to fall short of the Italian club's valuation of the 20-year-old. Talks are ongoing between the two clubs at present and United are pushing to get the deal done by the start of August in order to integrate Hojlund with his potential new teammates before the start of the 2023/24 campaign. The offer has not been rejected out of hand, but United are now prepared to go higher if necessary and some ground will likely need to be made up to reach a price closer to Atalanta's valuation - understood to be    70m ( £59.9m, $77.5m). feed United have agreed personal terms in principle with Hojlund and the player wants the move, citing himself previously as a United fan. There is understood to be optimism that a deal will eventually be reached, with the two clubs in talks for a number of months. The Red Devils have already strengthened Erik ten Hag's squad with the captures of goalkeeper Andre Onana and midfielder Mason Mount, while Jonny Evans has returned to the club on a short-term deal to provide pre-season cover in defence. Marcus Rashford recently signed a new five-year contract in a further boost to United, with the 25-year-old looking to build on a career-best season that saw him score 30 goals in all competitions.
