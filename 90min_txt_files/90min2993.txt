Barcelona club president Joan Laporta has hinted Manchester United are not the only team to have made an offer for Frenkie de Jong this summer, but they are currently reluctant to let him leave. Erik ten Hag has made De Jong, who he worked with at Ajax, his priority target after taking the reins at Old Trafford. 90min understands Man Utd have agreed an    85m fee with Bar  a for the midfielder, but he will not entertain an exit from Camp Nou until he is paid nearly    20m in deferred wages. Reports in Spain have also suggested that the likes of Chelsea and Bayern Munich are interested in his signature. In an interview with ESPN, Laporta insisted he 'wants to talk' to De Jong in order to clarify his future. "He is our player, a high quality player. We like him very much. We must clarify some aspects of his position, but right now he's a player of Barcelona. He has some offers, but at the moment we don't accept the offers because we want to talk to him in order to know exactly what he wants," he said. Despite Barcelona's ongoing financial woes, they have had a busy summer window, notably signing Robert Lewandowski from Bayern Munich. They remain on the hunt for further squad reinforcements and have not given up hope of bringing in Chelsea target Jules Kounde.
