Manchester United have made contact with the representatives of Villarreal defender Pau Torres - less than a week before the two sides meet in the Europa League final. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side have long been linked with a move for the Spain international, who will get a first-hand look at his potential future teammates next week. 90min has previously reported that Torres is on United's shortlist of centre-back targets, along with Sevilla defender Jules Kounde.  And now AS (via Sport Witness) write that United have made it 'very clear' to Torres' representatives that they will pursue his signing in the coming transfer window. United and Villarreal are set to meet in Gdansk next Wednesday, and fresh reports of the Red Devils' interest will do little to help Unai Emery and his side's preparations. Torres' release clause stands at    65m, though there is belief that Villarreal would be swayed by bids of around    50m. However, United aren't alone in the race for the centre-back. AS add that Real Madrid - who Torres coincidentally will also face before the end of the season - have made contact with him directly. Real could lose both Sergio Ramos and Raphael Varane this summer, and the need to bring in a new defender is high on their list of priorities. Madrid need to beat Torres' Villarreal to have any hope of wrestling the title away from city rivals Atletico this weekend.
