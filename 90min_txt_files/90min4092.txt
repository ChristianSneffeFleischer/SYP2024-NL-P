Chelsea are considering a move for former Manchester United goalkeeper Sergio Romero as they seek a new third-choice goalkeeper this summer.  The Blues are well-stocked in the goalkeeping department as things stand, with Edouard Mendy and Kepa Arrizabalaga set to continue their battle over the No 1 jersey. The Senegal international is Thomas Tuchel's current choice, starting the majority of games since signing last September. However, some decent form from Kepa late in the season went some way to restoring his damaged reputation.  The departure of Wily Caballero, however, means that the experience level drops dramatically beyond those two. 21-year-old Jamie Cumming, who spent last season at Stevenage, is the most senior option, but the Blues seem unlikely to keep him around to play third-choice.  Instead, it's widely believed they will go looking for an experienced keeper to come in and support Kepa and Mendy. And, according to The Telegraph, they are considering Romero as a budget solution.  The 34-year-old wasn't named in a matchday squad once for United last season, with David de Gea, Dean Henderson and even Lee Grant all preferred to the Argentine. So it was no surprise that when his contract expired, he left the club in search of something new.  He is still viewed as a capable stopper, and was understudy to De Gea for five years until he was pushed down the pecking order by Henderson and Grant last season. He played 61 times across his six seasons at Old Trafford, but hasn't appeared in the Premier League since 2017/18.
