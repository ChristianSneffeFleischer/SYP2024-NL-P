Burnley winger Dwight McNeil has attracted the attention of Premier League rivals Leicester City and Wolverhampton Wanderers, while Juventus and AC Milan are also interested.  McNeil joined Burnley's youth setup after being released by Manchester United's academy in 2014. The 20-year-old broke into the Clarets' first-team midway through the 2018/19 season and has become a mainstay of the side since.  The England Under-21 international scored two goals and laid on six assists in last season's Premier League, attracting the attention of sides both home and abroad for the quality and consistency of his performances.  The quartet of Leicester, Wolves, Juventus and Milan are the latest in a long list of clubs supposedly interested in Burnley's number 11, according to a report from Sky Sports.  Manchester City were another Premier League side linked to McNeil in recent weeks as they considered a number of players to replace the departed Leroy San  . Pep Guardiola's side eventually plumped for Spanish winger Ferran Torres - signed from Valencia - but even though their interest has ended, the Burnley star is not short of suitors. Links between McNeil and Juventus were one of the surprise rumours from last summer. However, the Italian champions - with incoming manager Andrea Pirlo already keen to make some changes to the squad - have reignited their interest.  In December, Burnley boss Sean Dyche was consigned to the inevitable eventuality that McNeil will outgrow the Clarets, describing the winger as 'a player who will certainly go beyond us - but in a positive way'.
