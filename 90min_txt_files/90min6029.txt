Manchester City have confirmed that goalkeeper Claudio Bravo has left the club following the expiration of his contract.  Bravo followed Pep Guardiola to the Etihad Stadium back in the summer of 2016 for around  Â£15.4m and went on to make 61 appearances for City in total. During this time, he managed to keep 20 clean sheets. The Chilean has been limited to mainly cup appearances since the arrival of Ederson back in the summer of 2017, however.
