Jack Wilshere is once again a free agent, with AGF Aarhus confirming that the former Arsenal player had been released following the expiration of his contract.  Wilshere made the surprise move to Denmark in February, penning a deal until the end of the season.  Despite featuring in the majority of AGF's games following his arrival, the club confirmed on Wednesday that his stay would not be being extended. "In the spring, AGF benefited from Jack Wilshere's great footballing and human qualities on a deal that expired at the end of June," a statement read. "There has subsequently been a dialogue on continuing the cooperation, but after careful consideration, the parties have jointly come to the conclusion that the agreement will not be extended." "We all want to thank Jack for the time he has been in AGF," sports manager Stig Inge Bjornebye added.   "It has been a great pleasure to work with him and experience him share his experiences from a very nice and special career.   "With his confident personality and down-to-earth attitude, he has made a big impression on everyone in AGF.  He has become a friend of our club, and we wish him all the best for the future and good luck with the new challenges." Wilshere has struggled to remain fit since leaving Arsenal in 2018, taken in an injury-laden two seasons at West Ham before signing for AFC Bournemouth in 2021 - a club he previously spent time on loan with.
