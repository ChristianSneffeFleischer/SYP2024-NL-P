Leeds United have agreed a deal to sign Spanish centre-back Diego Llorente from Real Sociedad for a fee believed to be in the region of    20m. The Whites have already strengthened their central defensive position with the arrival of SC Freiburg star Robin Koch, as they look to shore up their backline for their much-anticipated return to the English top-flight.  Thank you for the three years you have been part of our club! Good luck @diego_2llorente!#AurreraReala pic.twitter.com/B9tVjptGop And Real Sociedad confirmed on their official Twitter account that Llorente would be leaving the Spanish side after three years at the club, thanking him for his service and efforts, and wishing him all the best on his new adventure.  The 27-year-old came through the famous Real Madrid youth academy, but only managed to make two league appearances for the senior side. He spent two years on loan at Rayo Vallecano and Malaga, before signing a five-year-deal with Sociedad in the summer of 2016.  Llorente went on to make 88 appearances over the next three seasons for the Txuri-urdinak, where he impressed in a strong and exciting Real team. His commanding displays have seen him recognised at international level too, making his debut for Spain's senior side in 2016, and collecting a total of five caps for La Furia Roja.  The Spaniard becomes Leeds' fourth new face to join them on their Premier League adventure, following the signings of Valencia striker Rodrigo, the aforementioned Koch and Wigan Athletic starlet Joe Gelhardt.
