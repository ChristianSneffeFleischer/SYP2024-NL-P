Paris Saint-Germain have confirmed that Kylian Mbappe has been allowed to return to first-team training after "constructive and positive discussions" regarding his future.  90min reported earlier this week that Mbappe had reiterated his desire to stay at PSG beyond this summer despite not taking up his option to trigger a clause which would extend his current contract at the club until the summer of 2025. That decision not to trigger an extension had led to PSG shopping the superstar forward around this summer due to the fear of losing him as a free agent next summer. The Ligue 1 giants accepted a world record offer  of  Â£257m (   300m) from Al Hilal last month, but despite proposing a gargantuan contract offer to Mbappe, the PIF-backed Saudi Pro League side were  unable to persuade the France star to enter negotiations. On top of trying to sell Mbappe, PSG had also banished the player from first-team training and even refused to select him for their recent pre-season tour of Japan.  manual Now, however, the 2018 World Cup winner is back in the first-team squad and back in training with his teammates after what the club have described as positive talks regarding the player's future which took place on Saturday.  A club statement on the news reads: "After very constructive and positive discussions between Paris Saint-Germain and Kylian Mbappe before the PSG - Lorient match, this Saturday 12th August, the player was reinstated in first-team training this morning."  Mbappe was in the stands on Saturday for PSG's 0-0 draw with Lorient in their Ligue 1 season opener, sitting alongside new teammate Ousmane Dembele, whom the club officially confirmed the signing of on Saturday morning. The pair could feature together for the first time at club level next Saturday when Luis Enrique's team take on Toulouse.
