Barcelona are keen to sign Adama Traore on a permanent deal in the summer and could offer Riqui Puig to Wolves as makeweight in the deal.  Adama has enjoyed a terrific start to life back at the Camp Nou, registering four assists from eight games in all competitions. He rejoined his boyhood club on loan in January and there is an option for Bar  a to make the deal permanent at the end of the season.  To sign Adama, La Blaugrana would need to spend    30m and according to Fabrizio Romano, although they have been extremely impressed by his performances of late, the club are keen to negotiate a lower price with Wolves.  One option could be offering Puig to the Premier League side. The midfielder has been a bit-part player at Barcelona over the past few seasons and has only played 13 times in all competitions this campaign.  He has been linked with a move away from Camp Nou for some time and could be interested in joining Wolves, who tend to play with three central midfielders.  Barcelona president Joan Laporta has made no secret of the club's desire to sign Adama permanently, though he did admit that financing the deal could prove challenging.
