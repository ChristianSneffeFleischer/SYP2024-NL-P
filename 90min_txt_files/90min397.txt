Fulham are hopeful of beating some of Europe's biggest clubs to a deal for Brazil international midfielder Andre Trindade, 90min understands. The Fluminense midfielder was a target for Fulham in January. They could not get a deal over the line then, but their interest in the 21-year-old has remained. Fulham were close to a deal at just under  £20m during the winter transfer window, but any agreement now may have to be nearer the  £25m mark. Since the Cottagers' initial interest, Andre has made his full international debut and a number of clubs are taking a keen interest in his future. feed 90min understands that the likes of Barcelona, Atletico Madrid, Liverpool, Arsenal, Tottenham and West Ham have all been spoken to by the player's representatives in recent months. But it is Fulham who are making a firm push and are confident of finalising a deal. Fulham, who are also in for Brazilian defender Igor from Fiorentina, are yet to make a breakthrough in the transfer market this summer, but they have already lost out to Tottenham over Israeli winger Manor Solomon. They could yet see Willian move on as the veteran Brazilian has turned down the opening offer of a new contract and is now weighing up options elsewhere, despite an improved offer on the table.  The club are also battling to fend off Saudi Arabian interest in both their manager manager Marco Silva and star striker Aleksandar Mitrovic.
