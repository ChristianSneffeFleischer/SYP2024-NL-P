Well, we can hardly say it was a surprise. Despite reaching the Champions League final just four months ago, Paris Saint-Germain have parted ways with Thomas Tuchel after an underwhelming start to the 2020/21 campaign. The German boss' departure comes just days before the January transfer window, which begs the question: how will this impact their transfer strategy? Far gone are the days where a manager had complete control of the incomings and outgoings at a club, so the plans will already be laid, though the new man will undoubtedly bring with him his own ideas. Regardless of who comes through the door at Parc des Princes     and let's say we think it'll be Mauricio Pochettino     we've listed some of the moves PSG need to make over the coming month. The French champions have got a lot of high earners on their books who really aren't getting enough of a look in with the first team to warrant their substantial cost.If PSG are serious about their pursuit of Lionel Messi then they need to make room on the wage bill, and Julian Draxler, Juan Bernat and Thilo Kehrer should all be moved on in January while they can still demand a fee for the trio. Angel Di Maria has been a world class forward, but by the end of the season he'll be 33 years of age and the need for change is clear.The Argentina international has arguably played the best football of his career in France, but if PSG are serious about becoming European champions then they can't be carrying a forward in the twilight of his career.Whether the man they line up is a certain countryman of Di Maria's who is currently plying his trade in Barcelona remains to be seen, but either way they need to look to the future. When PSG opted to take Moise Kean from Everton on loan for the season, it hardly looked a signing befitting a team that had narrowly missed out on becoming European champions, who were keen to strengthen before their next tilt at Champions League glory.However, the loanee has performed very well in Paris, notching seven goals in 11 Ligue 1 outings.Whether the Toffees are willing to part with the talented youngster remains to be seen, but it's certainly worth asking the question as they look to add a more youthful look to the squad.
