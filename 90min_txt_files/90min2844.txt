Leicester City boss has explained he started Wesley Fofana and James Maddison in Sunday's Premier League clash at home to Brentford because he believes their 'commitment' has not wavered. Fofana is the subject of intense interest from Chelsea and the Blues remain locked in talks regarding a deal for the defender, while Leicester have already knocked back two bids from Newcastle for Maddison. Nevertheless, Rodgers chose to play both from the start in their 2-2 draw with Brentford, and explained this decision in his pre-match press conference. When asked whether Fofana and Maddison were appropriately focused, Rodgers replied: "Yes, 100 per cent. I think it's always a challenging time until the window shuts. "There's always speculation and gossip around players leaving but I always assess the players everyday and if their mentality and commitment doesn't change, then that's all you want. "So, yeah, both players are very important players for us and I look forward to seeing them play."
