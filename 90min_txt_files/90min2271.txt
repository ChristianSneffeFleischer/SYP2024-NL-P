Barcelona are expected to have to first sell players if they want to make any signings in the January transfer window, with the club still grappling with financial difficulties. Despite ongoing problems, the Catalans splashed the cash ahead of this season but had to sell off stakes of future TV rights and other revenue streams to fund the signings of Robert Lewandowski, Raphinha and Jules Kounde, plus new contracts for Ousmane Dembele and Sergi Roberto. Since then, they've had a mixed time of things. They sit top of La Liga at this stage of the season but crashed out in the group stages of the Champions League after losses to Bayern Munich and Inter. Having also been beaten by Real Madrid so far this season, it is expected that president Joan Laporta could look to make more signings in January. However, according to Mundo Deportivo, the club will first have to sell players if they want to bring any new ones in as new faces would have implications regarding La Liga's strict financial rules on salary and spending power. Given their wage bill  has been the issue, they could let players leave on free transfer rather than demanding a fee for them. Memphis Depay is one player who could well leave in such a manner -  the club were willing to let him leave for free in the summer but he ultimately stayed put after failing to agree personal terms with Juventus.
