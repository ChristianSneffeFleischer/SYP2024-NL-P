Crystal Palace manager Patrick Vieira isn't worried that talisman Wilfried Zaha has yet to renew his contract. The 29-year-old is out of contract at Selhurst Park next summer, and has regularly been linked with moves to clubs playing in European competition. Zaha scored the winner against Wolves in Palace's 2-1 win over Wolves on Tuesday night - his fifth goal of the Premier League season - and showed all of his qualities in another dazzling display. Chelsea were linked with a move for Zaha in the summer, while he's previously been linked with the likes of Borussia Dortmund and Tottenham Hotspur. But Vieira isn't concerned by the fact that Zaha is yet to renew his deal, and says the Ivorian is aware of Palace's feelings towards him and their desire to see him help develop emerging talents like Michael Olise and Eberechi Eze. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  and  Toby Cudworth  are joined by  Tom Gott  in the latest episode of Talking Transfers. The team discuss Erling Haaland's Manchester City release clause, Mason Mount's future at Chelsea and their sporting director plans, and what the future could hold for 700-goal Cristiano Ronaldo at Man Utd.

"Wilfried knows what the club thinks about him and we know what he thinks about the club. "There will be a discussion taking place but for myself and for the club what is important is for him to play at this level and to be consistent and to help those young players around him to grow and we   ll see what will happen." He continued: "Wilfried can work with them, can be a positive example on how clinical you can be in front of goal," he added.
