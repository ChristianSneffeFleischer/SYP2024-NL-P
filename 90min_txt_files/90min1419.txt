Borussia Dortmund are determined to secure the long-term future of Julian Brandt, with several Premier League clubs checking in on him this season, 90min understands. After a quiet couple of seasons at BVB after joining from Bayer Leverkusen in 2019, Brandt has become an integral part of an exciting side that is fighting for the Bundesliga title. Though traditionally a wide player, the 26-year-old has spent a lot of his time playing as either an attacking midfielder or central midfielder too. In 32 games across all competitions for Dortmund this season, Brandt has tallied nine goals and five assists, and his form has not gone unnoticed.
