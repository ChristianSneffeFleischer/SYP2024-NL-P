Aaron Ramsey has been touted as a potential makeweight in Juventus    bid to sign out-of-favour Chelsea midfielder Jorginho. Despite being a regular starter for the majority of Frank Lampard   s first season at the helm, Jorginho appears to have become surplus to requirements at Stamford Bridge - with a ten-minute cameo at Crystal Palace his only involvement since the restart. The Serie A giants are said to have been keeping tabs on Jorginho for some time now, with Maurizio Sarri keen to instigate a reunion with the man he managed at both Chelsea and Napoli. Italian news outlet Tuttosport claim the Old Lady will offer Ramsey in a proposed swap deal with the London club, while Adrien Rabiot has also been mentioned as a player they would be willing to offer in exchange for the former Arsenal man.  With the signings of Hakim Ziyech and Timo Werner already confirmed and a potential bid for Kai Havertz in the offing, it remains to be seen whether Lampard feels the need to further bolster his attacking options. Ramsey has enjoyed a solid first season in Turin, making 29 appearances and scoring four goals. He looks set to earn the first league championship winner   s medal of his career this season, with Juve now seven points clear of their nearest-challengers Lazio with just seven games to play. Juventus    pursuit of Jorginho has been public knowledge for some time, with the Italian champions said to have already offered out-of-favour attacking midfielder Federico Bernardeschi in a swap deal.
