The French side had been discussing a deal with Ajax a few weeks back, but despite voicing their intention to sign Onana, they have gone AWOL from the negotiating table, leaving the door open for Arsenal if they wish. "I   m not sure if we   ll get to a deal with Lyon," Overmars said.    There hasn   t been contact for a week."
