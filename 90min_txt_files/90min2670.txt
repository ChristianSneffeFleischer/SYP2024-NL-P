Eintracht Frankfurt have dismissed reports linking Kevin Trapp with a move to Manchester United this transfer window. The Germany international has been linked with the Red Devils in recent days as they look to bring in a backup stopper - and ideally one who is more comfortable with the ball at his feet than David de Gea. However, the Europa League champions have moved quickly to dismiss such speculation, with Trapp himself even playing down talk of a move away from the Bundesliga club. "As I said during my first spell at Frankfurt, it's always nice when rumours like this come out. It's a nice acknowledgement. But I can't say anything about it," he said at the SportBild Awards. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey,  Toby Cudworth  and  Harry Symeou  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Antony attempting to push through a move to Man Utd, Frenkie de Jong and Pierre-Emerick Aubayemang's futures at Barcelona and Arsenal's interest in Pedro Neto.
