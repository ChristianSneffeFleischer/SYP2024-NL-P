Julian Araujo is finally heading to Barcelona from LA Galaxy following an appeal from the Spanish club to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). The defender   s move from LA Galaxy to Barcelona initially fell through during deadline day after FIFA confirmed the documentation for the transfer was filed too late. Despite both teams filing an appeal for the deal, the global football governing body denied the case.   Barcelona director of football Mateu Alemany confirmed a 'system error' caused his club to miss the midnight deadline at the end of the transfer window by a matter of just 18 seconds.   A FIFA spokesperson reaffirmed the situation.   "FIFA can confirm that the transfer of the player Julian Araujo from LA Galaxy to FC Barcelona was not completed in line with the applicable regulations," they told ESPN.   But the Mexican national team player will now join Barcelona, after Alemany appealed the case to CAS.    He is set to arrive on a three-year contract, for 'a bit less than    4m' according to Fabrizio Romano.     It wasn   t my request, but I   m delighted that he   s coming,    added Barcelona Atletic manager and Mexico legend Rafa Marquez.    They   ve already been watching him since before I arrived. Now this situation has arisen and I   m delighted. He   s going to be with me for a while and then move on to the first-team. He   ll be able to integrate bit by bit, and hopefully have a nice career here.    The move is a dream come true for the player, who affirmed his desire to move abroad in an exclusive interview with 90min.      I definitely want to go to Europe. It   s my dream. My goal is to go to Europe. I want to reach my highest potential and I feel like going to Europe is going to help me do that,    he said to 90min.
