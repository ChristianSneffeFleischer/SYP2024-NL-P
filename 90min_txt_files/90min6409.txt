Manchester United have confirmed that midfielder Nemanja Mati   has penned a new three-year contract at Old Trafford. The 31-year-old's previous deal was set to expire in 2021, but after an outstanding upturn in form in recent months, United moved quickly to ensure he remains at the club for a little while longer.        @NemanjaMatic is here to stay! #MUFC After battling injury for the first half of the season, Mati   has bounced back in impressive fashion, starting 12 of United's last 14 Premier League games, and his dominant showings at the base of the midfield have helped the Red Devils climb back up the league table. Speaking to the club's official website, Mati   said:    I am very happy that I will continue to be part of this great club. As a player, I still have a lot more to give and achieve in my career and to do that with Manchester United will be a huge honour.    This is a really exciting team to be part of, we have a good balance of youth and experience within the squad and there is great camaraderie amongst the group. This is a key part of the season and we are playing well. We will continue to fight to finish the season on a high and make our amazing supporters proud.    The contract comes as a reward for an impressive comeback from Mati  , who has been heavily linked with a move away from Old Trafford during United's youth revolution. Injuries and underwhelming form had many fans calling for the Serb to be sold, with Atl  tico Madrid, Inter and Juventus all rumoured to have expressed an interest, but manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was eager to keep Mati   around.    I am delighted that Nemanja has signed a new contract, I know his experience, professionalism and leadership will be invaluable to this young talented group," the boss said.
