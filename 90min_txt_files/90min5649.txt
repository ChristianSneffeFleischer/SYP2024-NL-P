Leeds are keeping an eye on Daniel James' current situation at Manchester United as they ponder a sensational swoop for the player who came close to signing for them in January 2019. Since joining the Red Devils from Swansea last summer, James' career in Manchester has been frustrating, with the Welshman now often a peripheral figure despite an initially promising start to his time under Ole Gunnar Solskj  r. James' career almost went in a very different direction, with the winger previously having passed a medical at Leeds where he was even pictured in the shirt ahead of an announcement, before Swansea's chairman Huw Jenkins cancelled the transfer after a disagreement over the structuring of the deal. Leeds may end up getting their man almost two years later, however, with the Daily Star reporting that Marcelo Bielsa is looking to renew his interest in the wide man. While the Jadon Sancho transfer saga continues to rumble on at Manchester United and may not be resolved during this window, it is clear that United have a strong interest in signing another wide player, with Ivan Peri  i   and Bournemouth's David Brooks also potential candidates for a move to the north of England. Any such move would undoubtedly see James marginalised to an even greater extent, and Leeds are prepared to take advantage of the Welshman's uncertain standing in Manchester by taking him on a season-long loan with a view to a permanent transfer next summer.
