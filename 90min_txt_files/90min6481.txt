Real Madrid defender Achraf Hakimi is set to join Inter next week after a 'total agreement' was reached between all parties.  The Moroccan played his final minutes for Borussia Dortmund on Saturday afternoon, as BVB ended their Bundesliga campaign on a sour note - slumping to a shock 4-0 home defeat to Hoffenheim. Saturday's defeat wraps up an incredibly successful two-year loan spell for Hakimi at Signal Iduna Park. The electric 21-year-old contributed to 29 goals in 73 appearances and particularly excelled after Lucien Favre switched to a 3-4-2-1 in November, allowing Hakimi to maraud forward from a wing-back role.  Real Madrid's willingness to sell this summer saw a glut of Europe's biggest clubs enter the Hakimi sweepstakes, including Manchester City, Bayern and Chelsea. But it appears that Inter - managed by Antonio Conte - have won the race. Previous reports of Real and Inter agreeing a fee - as well as Hakimi agreeing personal terms - have now escalated to a 'total agreement', according to renowned journalist Fabrizio Romano. He claims a move will be finalised next week, with a medical also set to take place. The agreement between Real and Inter is thought to be worth an initial    40m, fee plus    5m add ons, and does not include a buy-back clause - which is great news for I Nerazzurri. Dortmund, meanwhile, were interested in acquiring Hakimi on a permanent basis, but they've now found their replacement in the form of free agent Thomas Meunier - who joined the club on Friday.
