Negotiations between Juan Mata and Leeds United are 'on the right track' but a deal between the two parties is still some way off, 90min understands. The Spanish playmaker is a free agent following the expiration of his contract with Manchester United at the end of the 2021/22 Premier League season. Mata has since been linked with a number of destinations, including moves to Major League Soccer and the Turkish Super Lig, with Istanbul giants Galatasaray and Besiktas reportedly interested.  But a source close to the situation has told 90min that Mata is currently in talks with Leeds United, with the club's director of football Victor Orta in direct contact. Negotiations are understood to be going slowly with no deal yet agreed, but the two parties are on the right track and the veteran midfielder would be happy to make the move to Elland Road. 90min understands Mata's priority this summer is remaining in a top European league, with England, Italy, Spain, France, and the Netherlands all mentioned as preferable destinations.
