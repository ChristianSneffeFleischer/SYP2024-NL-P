Gianluigi Buffon could extend his Juventus contract until 2022, meaning he may still be playing top level football at the age of 44. The legendary stopper initially signed for the Old Lady back in 2001 and spent 17 years at the club, before taking a season long sabbatical at Paris Saint-Germain. He returned to Juventus in 2019 and has since proved an experienced deputy for first-choice goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny, making 18 appearances in all competitions. His current deal is set to expire at the end of the season but according to Corriere Torino (via Luca Fioretti) he could pen fresh terms soon. Buffon is said to feel in good shape, both physically and mentally, and there are also few complaints from Juventus' perspective.  He has appeared four times in Serie A this season, registering an impressive 89% save percentage during that period, as well as keeping two clean sheets.  Over the course of his storied career, the 42-year-old has won almost every honour available to him, including the World Cup, ten Scudetti and the UEFA Cup in 1999. The trophy that has continued to elude him is the Champions League. He has come close to ending that drought on several occasions, losing three finals in 2003, 2015 and 2017.  There are serious question marks over whether his luck will change this year with Juventus enduring a testing start to the season. Andrea Pirlo's side currently sit fourth in Serie A, seven points adrift of surprise leaders Milan with a game in hand. They were also completely outclassed in the recent Derby d'Italia, with Inter running out comfortable 2-0 winners.
