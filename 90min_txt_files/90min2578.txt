Manchester United are ready to keep hold of Aaron Wan-Bissaka if they do not bring in a replacement at right-back in the final days of the transfer window, 90min understands. United had informed Wan-Bissaka that he could look for a move and host of clubs had shown an interest, including his former side Crystal Palace, who still hope to land him. Erik ten Hag has been hoping to bring in a new right-back having not been fully convinced by Wan-Bissaka or current first-choice Diogo Dalot. Celtic's Josip Juranovic is a player United have looked closely at, while the club are being kept abreast of Sergino Dest's situation at Barcelona - and the American continues to be the most likely option for United. United enquired about Dest early in the summer but at that point the 21-year-old was determined to prove himself at Camp Nou. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  &  Toby Cudworth  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Lucas Paqueta's move to West Ham, Chelsea's plans to sign Anthony Gordon, Wesley Fofana and Arsen Zakharyan and the latest from Old Trafford.
