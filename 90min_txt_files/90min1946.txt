Manchester United have held talks with Burnley over signing Wout Weghorst on loan, 90min can confirm. United are on the hunt for attacking reinforcements this month following the departure of Cristiano Ronaldo and have a number of different names on their radar, one of which is Ajax's Mohammed Kudus. The Red Devils are exploring all their options and sources have confirmed to 90min that United have spoken with Burnley about the possibility of signing Weghorst, who is currently in the middle of a season-long loan with Turkish giants Besiktas. Having asked about the chances of taking over his loan contract for the remainder of the season, United have been informed that Burnley are happy to send the 30-year-old Dutchman to Old Trafford but the final decision will rest with Besiktas. The Turkish side have the option to sign Weghorst permanently and so must give their approval to terminating the loan early - something they may be reluctant to do as the striker sits top of their scoring charts with eight goals in 16 games. Burnley have made it clear that United must negotiate with Besiktas and pay any compensation the Turkish side may demand. The Red Devils have lodged their interest with the Turkish giants but formal talks are yet to be held.
