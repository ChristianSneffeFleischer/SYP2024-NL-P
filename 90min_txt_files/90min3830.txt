Real Madrid have been credited with interest in Inter and Italy centre-back Alessandro Bastoni, although a hefty valuation could be an early obstacle to any pursuit. Inter paid a reported    31m for Bastoni in 2017 when he was still only 18. He spent two further years developing on loan at boyhood club Atalanta but has been increasingly regular at Inter since 2019. Real are in the midst of a defensive rebuild after the summer saw both Sergio Ramos and Raphael Varnae depart and only David Alaba arrive. Jesus Vallejo is currently making up the numbers following a return from his latest loan last season, while Nacho and Eder Militao remain the only other recognised centre-back options in the squad. Real have previously been linked with Pau Torres and Jules Kounde of Villarreal and Sevilla respectively. But fresh gossip thought to have originated in Italy has linked Los Blancos with Bastoni, who is still only 22 and very highly regarded. The defender, who was a member of Italy   s Euro 2020 winning squad during the summer, has started five times in Serie A this season and even played in the Champions League against Real. It is claimed that Bastoni is of particular to interest to Real   s Italian coach Carlo Ancelotti. However, the player is still under contract at San Siro for another three years, giving Inter a position of power, with a potential valuation in the region of    60m. Mundo Deportivo writes that Chelsea   s Antonio Rudiger is already a potential target to strengthen at the back ahead of next season. The Germany international is out of contract at the end of this season and 90min recently revealed he looks increasingly likely to leave as talks have stalled.
