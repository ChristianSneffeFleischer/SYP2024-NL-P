Arsenal and Newcastle United are both showing a strong interest in Strasbourg's French teenager Ismael Doukoure, 90min understands. The 19-year-old is quickly emerging as one of the best young defenders in Ligue 1 and is currently part of France   s  Under-20 squad that is in Marbella for a youth tournament against England, Netherlands and the United States. 90min understands that almost every Premier League club has been represented by scouts at the tournament, with Doukoure one of the standout players attracting significant interest. Arsenal and Newcastle have both been watching Doukoure since last year - and have been impressed by what they've seen - while Paris Saint-Germain, Sevilla and Atalanta are among the clubs tracking him. READ NEXT manual PSG's interest in Doukoure is understood to emanate from the superb performance he put in him against them in December, when he excelled against Kylian Mbappe. France's new captain ultimately scored an injury-time winner, but Doukoure was singled out for praise for how he combated the World Cup Golden Boot winner's pace and movement. Doukoure began his career with Valenciennes before being snapped up by  Strasbourg in January 2022, and is a versatile defender capable of playing in a number of positions. He has predominantly lined up at centre-back for this season, but is able to play at right-back and as a defensive midfielder. Strasbourg have Doukoure contracted to the club until the summer of 2026, but their resolve may be tested this summer if he continues to shine between now and the end of the campaign. LISTEN NOW
