Chelsea are close to finalising the signing of 18-year-old Benfica winger Diego Moreira, 90min understands. Moreira, who plays his football with Benfica's B team but has managed two appearances for the senior side, is approaching the end of his contract in Portugal and a number of clubs have expressed an interest in the teenager. Paris Saint-Germain have explored a move for Moreira but sources have confirmed to 90min that Chelsea are leading the race for his signature and are close to getting a deal done. Moreira is expected to become the latest youngster to head to Stamford Bridge as part of Chelsea's Vision 2030 - the name given to the Blues' plan to fill their academy with top stars and create an influx of first-team talent over the next decade. feed Born in Belgium but a Portugal youth international, Moreira is a tricky left winger known for his electric pace and dribbling abilities. He played an integral role in Benfica's triumph in the 2021/22 UEFA Youth League, a competition Chelsea know very well, by scoring four goals and assisting a further five to steer the Portuguese side to their first ever win in the tournament. Compared to the likes of Nani and Leroy Sane for his love of dribbling, Moreira has long been touted as a potential star of the future, with the likes of PSG and AC Milan looking to lure him away from Benfica, but Chelsea are set to win the race for his signature.
