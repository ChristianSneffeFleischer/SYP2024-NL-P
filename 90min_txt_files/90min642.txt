Liverpool have initiated contact with the representatives of RB Leipzig's Dominik Szoboszlai regarding a summer transfer, sources have confirmed to 90min. The Reds have been scouring the market for midfielders after missing out on top target Jude Bellingham to Real Madrid. Aurelien Tchouameni had also been a target in 2022. They have already brought in Alexis Mac Allister from Brighton this window, with plans in place to bring in one or two more midfielders. Liverpool's search has led them to Szoboszlai. 90min understands they have touched base with the Hungarian's camp over a move and he has a mutual interest in completing a switch to Merseyside. Newcastle United have also registered an interest - they are set to lose out on another key midfield target in James Maddison to Tottenham Hotspur - while other top sides from across Europe are monitoring the 22-year-old's situation. feed The major stumbling block for any club looking to buy Szoboszlai is RB Leipzig's asking price, currently demanding that his release clause of    70m is paid in full. They are in no rush to sell one of their star assets. Interestingly, Liverpool have already agreed to send fellow number ten Fabio Carvalho on loan to RB Leipzig for the 2023/24 season. The 20-year-old failed to make a major impact in his first year at Liverpool after arriving from Fulham.
