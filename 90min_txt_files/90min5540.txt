Newcastle United fan-favourite Salomon Rondon has opened up on his exit from St. James' Park, and confessed that he would jump at the chance of joining the Magpies again in January - if the opportunity arose.  The Venezuelan forward spent the 2018/19 season on loan in the north east, and he became an instant hero for supporters, scoring 11 league goals and helping his side to comfortably avoid relegation. Despite fans' calls for the club to sign him up permanently, the 31-year-old left at the end of the campaign, only to reunite with ex-Newcastle coach Rafa Benitez at Chinese outfit Dalian.  In an interview with The Guardian, Rondon has admitted that his departure from Newcastle was 'a mystery' to him, but he 'felt so much' when playing for the Premier League side, and would love to team up with them again.     I loved the pressure, proved I could wear that No 9 shirt and I thought I could stay,    Rondon said.     But you never know what can happen in football; it   s like a mystery. If they gave me the chance then of course I would not have missed it, but they didn   t say anything. Then Rafa called me and said:    Do you want to come to China? I have this project.
