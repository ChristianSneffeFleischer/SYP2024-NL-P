Chelsea have made an offer for 18-year-old Santos striker Deivid Washington, 90min understands. The Blues have not been afraid to splash the cash in the second summer under BlueCo, whose acquisition of Ligue 1 side Strasbourg has seen them step up their pursuits of a number of young talents who could hone their craft in France. There are hopes to use Strasbourg to finally get a deal for Russian starlet Arsen Zakharyan over the line, while Montpellier striker Elye Wahi could be loaned to the French side if a deal can be struck with his current employers. A decision must be made on new midfielder recruit Lesley Ugochukwu and Brazilian winger Angelo, who joined from Santos earlier this summer, has also been tipped for a move to Strasbourg. Sources have confirmed to 90min that Chelsea have once again returned to Santos with an offer for 18-year-old Washington. feed A bid of an initial  £13m, plus a further  £4m in add-ons, has been lodged by the Blues, who are trying to negotiate a discount on Santos'  £26m asking price. Clubs across Europe have been following Washington, with Monaco ready to match Chelsea's  £15m bid if it is accepted, but the Stamford Bridge outfit are working to win the race for his signature and could loan the teenager to Strasbourg if a deal is struck. Ligue 1 rules mean Chelsea can loan just three players out to Strasbourg, who must also adhere to the rule of having no more than four non-EU players on their books, so alternative strategies will have to be taken for some of these proposed loans. Washington has managed 16 senior appearances for Santos and has scored two goals, both of which came in consecutive outings in May.
