Less than two months ago Bayern Munich were crowned champions of Europe and quite frankly they looked unstoppable. However, with an uncharacteristic seven goals conceded in their opening three Bundesliga games, Hansi Flick has made a late dive into the transfer market to shore up his creaking backline. Right-back Bouna Sarr arrives at the Allianz Arena from Lique 1 side Marseille in a deal believed to be around the    10m ( Â£9m) mark.  #ServusBouna ?@BounaSarr_10 Now, you may well be feeling rather bashful at the fact you've absolutely no idea who Die Roten's new arrival is. Well, never fear - 90min's got your back with a rundown of everything you need to know about Bayern's latest addition. While you might have little to no idea who Sarr is, you'll most likely have heard his name once or twice. That's because the Bayern Munich signing has been chased by numerous Premier League clubs in the past.Leicester, Everton, West Ham, Southampton and more recently Newcastle have all courted the 28-year-old at one point or another, and Sarr's admirers haven't been limited to these shores either with Sevilla, Atletico Madrid and Real Betis also rumoured to have lodged an interest. Despite being born in France, Sarr's heritage means he actually qualifies to play for Senegal and Equatorial Guinea.Both countries have approached the new Bayern man in the past with Equatorial Guinea offering Sarr the opportunity to represent them at the 2015 African Cup of Nations before Senegal approached him in 2018.However, the right-back declined on both occasions and is yet to receive his maiden call up to the France squad. Once you've seen Sarr play it'll come as no surprise to you that he spent his early years playing as a winger.Despite being transformed into a full-back the 28-year-old hasn't lost that attacking instinct - a facet of his game which no doubt attracted him to Bayern, with sporting director Hasan Salihamidzic describing him as a    dynamic right-back'.In his 181 appearances for Marseille, Sarr racked up eight goals and 11 assists.
