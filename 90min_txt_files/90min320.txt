Thomas Partey has now linked up with the rest of Arsenal's pre-season squad in the United States, 90min understands, with the Gunners not seeking a summer transfer for the midfielder. Partey was granted permission to explore a move away from the club earlier this summer and was not included in Arsenal's initial pre-season squad. Clubs from Saudi Arabia registered interest in Partey and were prepared to make offers, but the Ghana international made it clear his preference was to remain in Europe. Despite a handful of clubs reaching out, no European suitors were prepared to meet Arsenal's asking price and now sources have confirmed to 90min that Partey is looking to integrate himself back into Arteta's squad. A summer transfer remains a possibility but would require a drastic shift, with no European clubs currently prepared to match the finances on offer from Saudi Arabia. feed Manager Mikel Arteta is happy to keep Partey in his squad going forward and has welcomed the 30-year-old back into the fold. Also re-joining the Arsenal squad is 22-year-old midfielder Emile Smith Rowe, who was granted extra time off after helping fire England to glory at the European Under-21 Championship this summer. Neither player is expected to play any part in the upcoming friendly against the MLS All-Stars and may even be kept out of the meeting with Manchester United that follows on July 22 as they seek to build their fitness. Arsenal will end their tour of the United States against Barcelona on July 26.
