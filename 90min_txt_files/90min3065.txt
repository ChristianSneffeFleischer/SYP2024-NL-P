Chelsea are expected to confirm the signing of Kalidou Koulibaly on Friday after the Senegalese international successfully passed a medical. The Blues have agreed a deal in the region of    40m with Napoli, and the 31-year-old is understood to have signed a contract at Stamford Bridge running until 2026. Koulibaly had been targeted by Juventus as a potential replacement for Matthijs de Ligt, who at one point was top of Chelsea's transfer radar, but interest from Bundesliga champions Bayern suddenly changed the dynamic. The Netherlands international quickly made it known that his preference was to move to Germany, although Juventus' lofty    100m asking price also played a role in Chelsea stepping back from a deal. Chelsea have already confirmed the signing of Manchester City and England forward Raheem Sterling in recent days, but Koulibaly's arrival is significant given the departures of Antonio Rudiger and Andreas Christensen this summer.
