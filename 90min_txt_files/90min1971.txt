Bayern Munich have confirmed the signing of Daley Blind on a contract which will run until the end of the season. Blind had his contract with Dutch giants Ajax mutually terminated at the end of December and joins the Bavarian side following his exploits for the Netherlands in Qatar at the 2022 World Cup. He will join the team's training camp in Doha on Friday, having completed a medical in Munich on Thursday. The defender played almost 350 games for Ajax across two spells, having also spent four years in England with Manchester United. Blind told the club's website:    I can hardly wait to play here. We   ve got the most important part of the season coming up, where it   s about titles     and a club like Bayern can win every trophy. The hunger for titles here at the club was key in my decision. I hope I can bring my experience to help the team. I   ll give everything for Bayern Munich.
