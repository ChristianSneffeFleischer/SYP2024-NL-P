Paris Saint-Germain have denied claims from a French news story reporting that Kylian Mbappe would earn    630m gross in his new contract and are considering legal action. Mbappe signed a new deal with Les Parisiens in the summer despite being on the cusp of completing a free transfer to Real Madrid, and it is believed to be one of the most lucrative sports contracts in history. Much has been said about Mbappe's new contract with PSG in the time since the saga came to an end, especially with his future in doubt once again. 90min reported earlier in October that Mbappe informed PSG he would like to leave in January. French outlet Le Parisien have now reported that the 23-year-old's latest contract is worth    630m gross over three years, which would make him the highest paid athlete of all time. However, PSG have since refuted the 'sensationalist article' in a statement: "PSG disagrees with the story and the alleged details. "The timing questions a few hours before an important LdC [Champions League] match. PSG will not stoop to making more comments." The original report stated his contract of    630m earnings - which would work out in excess of  Â£547m - was made up of several clauses, none of which were performance-related regarding the Champions League or winning the Ballon d'Or.
