Serie A side Genoa have reportedly held talks with Tottenham over a move for out-of-favour left-back Danny Rose, who looks set to leave north London after a fruitful loan spell with Newcastle.  Rose had been a regular at Tottenham for more than ten years, but fell firmly out of the picture following the arrival of Jos   Mourinho last year. Episode 5 of Amazon's 'Tottenham Hotspur: All or Nothing' documentary shed some incredible light on the situation, showing the blunt clear-the-air talks that were held between the player and his manager over his future. Rose was hopeful of a move to Milan, but that failed to materialise, and it was the Magpies who beat Bournemouth to his signature on a six-month loan. There he had all the chips he could eat as he became Steve Bruce's regular left-back.  The 30-year-old finds his future up in the air once more, however, as the acquisition of Jamal Lewis from Norwich means no permanent move to Tyneside is now likely. But while options are limited for the high-earning left-back, it seems he may get that move to Italy as Sky Sports report that Genoa have held talks with Mourinho's team over bringing him to Serie A.  They say that the Italian club have admitted a deal will be 'difficult' due to the finances involved, but are keen to bring him in, and help rebuild his reputation as one of England's best left-backs.
