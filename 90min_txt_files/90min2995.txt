Sassuolo CEO Giovanni Carnevali has confirmed West Ham have an agreement in place to sign striker Gianluca Scamacca. The Hammers moved on to Scamacca after a deal for Armando Broja slowed up and 90min revealed earlier this week that a transfer was nearly complete. West Ham are set to pay around    43m for Scamacca -    36m up front and    7m in performance related add-ons - and Carnevali has now revealed a deal has been reached. "There's an agreement with West Ham", he told Corriere dello Sport. "I'm sure he will do great things; he's a huge talent and a very good guy." Scamacca will provide overdue competition for Michail Antonio. West Ham's leading goalscorer in the Premier League has struggled with injuries in the past, though last season he featured in 36 of a possible 38 league games. Scamacca enjoyed his best season to date last time out, netting 16 times in 36 Serie A appearances. He had previously enjoyed a productive loan spell with Genoa and also made his international debut for Italy in 2021. The Irons are also pursuing a deal for Eintracht Frankfurt talisman Filip Kostic, who shares the same agent at Scamacca.
