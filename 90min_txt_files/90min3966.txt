Tottenham Hotspur are readying a move for Villarreal centre-back Pau Torres, who is said to be valued at  £55m. Torres featured prominently for Spain as they reached the Euro 2020 semi-finals, and also helped his club side win the Europa League last season.   Manchester United and Liverpool were both admirers, before they instead opted to sign Raphael Varane and Ibrahima Konate respectively. Now, according to The Times, Tottenham have entered the race for Torres    signature.   The defender   s release clause was originally    55m ( £46.8m) but increased part way through last season to    65m ( £55.4m). This was due to Torres earning a certain amount of caps for La Roja.   However, journalist Pedro Sepulveda has reported that Torres has no interest in heading to Spurs, as he wants to play in the Champions League with his boyhood club. Spurs are already likely to spend big on another centre-back, Cristian Romero, next summer. Romero has initially joined on-loan but Tottenham have an option to buy the player for  £42.5m. Romero is not the only new arrival in north London this season. 20-year-old Bryan Gil has also joined from Sevilla, in a deal that saw Erik Lamela move in the opposite direction. In addition, Atalanta goalkeeper Pierluigi Gollini will be spending the campaign on loan at Spurs, although whether he can displace Hugo Lloris from the side remains to be seen.
