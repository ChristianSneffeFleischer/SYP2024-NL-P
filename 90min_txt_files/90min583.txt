Chelsea have finalised the signings of highly rated teenagers Alex Matos and Diego Moreira to bolster their academy. The Blues are working to 'Vision 2030', a mission to recruit some of the game's best young talents at both senior and academy level with a view to creating an elite squad full of homegrown stars by the end of the decade. Big money has been spent on the likes of Carney Chukwuemeka and Cesare Casadei, while Santos starlet Angelo Gabriel is close to inking a    15m move to Stamford Bridge, but Chelsea have also been hard at work to try and find some real bargains in the market. They have now completed the signing of two 18-year-olds, midfielder Matos from Norwich and winger Moreira from Benfica. 90min reported in April that Moreira, a former target for Paris Saint-Germain, was closing in on a move to Chelsea and, following the expiry of his contract in Portugal, the teenage winger has now inked a deal at Cobham. feed Moreira, a Portugal Under-21 international, managed two appearances for the Benfica first team and has previously shone in the UEFA Youth League, notably bagging two assists in the 2021/22 final victory over Red Bull Salzburg. He is expected to join the Blues' academy setup alongside Matos, who began his career as a forward but gradually transitioned into a central midfielder towards the end of his time at Norwich. Chelsea had hoped to make a real statement with a move for Arsenal's Ethan Nwaneri, whose schoolboy deal with the Gunners expired at the end of June. An offer was made to the Premier League's youngest-ever player but Nwaneri has instead inked an extension with Arsenal.
