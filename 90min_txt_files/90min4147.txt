Manchester United target Raphael Varane is 'available' for transfer this summer, as Real Madrid look to cut heavy expenses from their wage bill - although a contract renewal cannot be ruled out just yet.  The coronavirus outbreak, which caused clubs to lose millions in revenue from ticket sales and general income, has left owners scrambling to sell their stars in a desperate attempt to cut costs and regain some control over their finances.  Los Blancos have avoided the grave consequences which face rivals Barcelona, who cannot register new players until they've offloaded    200m from their wage bill, but they remain in a perilous position.  Madrid are still hoping to reduce the numbers of players on their books this summer by selling some of their highest earners, and The Athletic has revealed that one of the stars they are considering selling this summer is Man Utd target Varane.  The 28-year-old has entered the final year of his Madrid contract, and he and his representatives are hoping to land one final mega-deal before he approaches the final years of his career. Real are evaluating whether it would be financially wise to offer Varane this amount of money, or whether to invest in youth, like they did with the Frenchman a decade ago.  Should they decide that it's time to move on and start afresh, then the door will be open for Man Utd to pounce. Varane is top of the Red Devils' list in their pursuit of a new defender, and they believe his profile is perfect to strengthen their current back line. Man Utd are reported to have agreed personal terms with the defender, and they are confident a deal can be sealed. But a lot could change in the coming weeks, if Madrid were able to shift some of the other deadwood from their squad.
