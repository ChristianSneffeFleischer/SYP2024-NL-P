The agent of RB Leipzig defender Josko Gvardiol has insisted they are in no rush to finalise a move away from the club. Chelsea remain locked in talks with Leipzig and are optimistic of their chances of striking a double deal to sign both Gvardiol and Christopher Nkunku, the latter of whom has already agreed a move to Stamford Bridge at the end of the season. Gvardiol has admitted he would like to play at Chelsea but also flirted publicly with Real Madrid, calling Los Blancos 'the biggest club in the world' and revealing his desire to play at the Santiago Bernabeu as well. Speaking to Sky Germany, Gvardiol's agent has confirmed that no agreement has been reached with any suitors yet and sent a warning that they are in no rush to agree to anything. "Regarding a possible transfer in summer 2023, we are not in a hurry and I can make clear that there are no pre-agreements with any clubs," Marjan Sisic revealed. "For sure, a lot of top clubs have asked about him but Josko has a long-term contract in Leipzig. Josko feels totally happy in Leipzig. His development is amazing and RB is playing very good under Marco Rose."
