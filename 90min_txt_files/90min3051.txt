Frenkie de Jong will jet off to the United States as part of Barcelona's squad for their pre-season tour. 90min understands Manchester United have agreed a fee totalling    85m with Barca for De Jong, who does not want any deal to advance until he's paid a substantial amount in unpaid wages. It had been suggested that he could be left out of Barcelona's squad for their tour of the US, but club president Joan Laporta revealed on Friday that he expected the Dutchman to be part of the travelling cohort. And Barcelona confirmed on Saturday that De Jong had been selected by Xavi to travel across the Atlantic. They will face Inter Miami, Real Madrid, Juventus and the New York Red Bulls before returning to Europe. De Jong will be joined by new signings Raphinha - who was unveiled as a Barca player on Friday - Franck Kessie and Andreas Christensen in the US, while Ousmane Dembele is also travelling after re-committing to the Blaugrana.
