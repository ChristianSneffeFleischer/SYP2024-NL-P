Barcelona are close to securing the signing of Noussair Mazraoui, with the Ajax defender turning down offers from the likes of Arsenal and Leeds.  The 24-year-old has enjoyed his best season to date in Amsterdam this term, registering five goals and four assists. His displays helped Erik ten Hag's side win each of their Champions League group-stage games, as well soar to the top of the Eredivisie table.  Mazraoui's contract expires at the end of the season with some of Europe's top clubs expressing their interest in recent times. According to SPORT, Bar  a have now won the race for his signature though, beating off competition from Arsenal, Borussia Dortmund, Leeds and Milan.  Xavi has long been interested in strengthening at right-back and rifled through his old contacts book to sign Dani Alves on a free transfer shortly after taking over.  90min understands that signing Mazraoui will not deter Barcelona's from pursuing Cesar Azpilicueta too. The Chelsea captain is also out of contract in the summer and can play across the backline, while the future of Sergino Dest is uncertain. This means that there should still be space for Azpilicueta in next season's squad.
