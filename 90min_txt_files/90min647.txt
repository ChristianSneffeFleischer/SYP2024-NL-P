Tottenham Hotspur are closing in on the signing of James Maddison after agreeing a fee with Leicester City, sources have told 90min. Spurs have been locked in talks with the Foxes for much of this month in the hope of striking a deal for long-term target Maddison. 90min reported on Tuesday that a transfer was nearing with new Tottenham head coach Ange Postecoglou pushing to make Maddision one of his first summer signings. And 90min now understands that Spurs and Leicester have reached an agreement over a fee that could total  £45m if all add-ons are met. He will shortly travel for a medical and finalise the move. Leicester, who were relegated to the Championship at the end of the 2022/23 Premier League season, had held out hope of selling Maddison for  £60m. But 90min revealed this week that their stance changed, allowing for smoother negotiations with Tottenham. feed Newcastle United had also shown significant interest in the midfielder, but Maddison's desire to move to north London was key to the deal, with the Magpies backing away from talks in recent weeks. Leicester are also keen to push ahead with their own transfer plans this window. They have deals lined up for Wolves defender Conor Coady and Manchester City goalkeeper Zack Steffen, while Tottenham playmaker Harry Winks is also a top target but talks over that have been kept separate to those regarding Maddison. Spurs have already completed two signings this summer, making Dejan Kulusevski's loan move from Juventus permanent at a fee lower than the purchase clause in his contract, while goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario officially joined the club on Tuesday.
