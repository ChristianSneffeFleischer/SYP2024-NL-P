Sergio Ramos has officially been announced as a Paris Saint-Germain player after penning a two-year deal at the club. The Spaniard had been in talks with Real Madrid over the possibility of extending his deal at the Santiago Bernabeu earlier this year, yet after deciding at the final hour he wanted to accept the one-year deal on offer, the defender claimed he was told it was too late and the offer had been withdrawn. ?? ???  ??!       ?? #WelcomeSergio pic.twitter.com/I26WKleStg Since his departure from Real there's been a whole host of European clubs linked with the veteran centre-back, with Manchester United one of those credited with an interest. Much has been made of Ramos' recent poor injury record - with the Spanish defender playing just one game in his final two seasons in Spain - though PSG have decided to take a gamble and have now officially announced his arrival in Paris. Ramos said: "I am very happy to join Paris Saint-Germain, Sergio Ramos revealed after signing his contract. This is a big change in my life, a new challenge and it's a day I will never forget.  "I am very proud to be a part of this ambitious project, to be a part of this squad with so many great players. Paris Saint-Germain is a club that has already proven itself at the highest level. I want to continue to grow and improve at Paris and help the team to win as many trophies as possible." Ramos completed a medical on Tuesday and has now signed a two-year deal which will keep him at the club until 2023. The arrival of Ramos is just the latest in a host of new faces at Parc des Princes this summer and it definitely doesn't look like being the last. PSG have already secured the free signing of Georginio Wijnaldum after the Dutchman's contract at Liverpool expired, while Achraf Hakimi was also announced as a PSG player this week.
