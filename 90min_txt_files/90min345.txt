Arsenal have slapped a  £50m price tag on striker Folarin Balogun as Inter begin talks with the player's representatives, 90min understands.  The USMNT international has recently returned to Arsenal following a hugely successful loan spell at Reims in Ligue 1. During his single season in France, the striker netted 21 goals in 37 league outings - a tally bettered by only Kylian Mbappe, Alexandre Lacazette and Jonathan David.  Having rejected the opportunity to sign a new contract at the Gunners upon his return, 90min recently reported that the club have asked the player's representatives to begin talking to interested parties in order to find a buyer.  One team that has emerged as suitors are Inter, who recently walked away from talks over bringing striker Romelu Lukaku back to San Siro on a permanent deal.

A huge stumbling block that clubs have found with any potential move is Arsenal's asking price. Sources have confirmed to 90min that Mikel Arteta's side are keen to get  £50m for the 22-year-old, but the player's agents are hoping they can whittle the asking price down to around  £40m.  Speaking exclusively to 90min at Arsenal's training camp ahead of the clash with MLS All-Stars in Washington DC, the striker insisted that his focused remains on pre-season despite the rampant discussion about his future:  "I was away for the year, so I'm just back, I'm obviously just focused on pre-season with the team."
