Andreas Christensen has penned a farewell message to Chelsea fans as he prepares to finalise his move to Barcelona. The centre-back brought his ten-year association with Chelsea to a close this summer as he allowed his contract to expire in order to seal a free transfer to Bar  a, despite Blues officials twice believing that they had reached an agreement over fresh terms with him. Ultimately, they could not get a deal over the line and Christensen attracted plenty of criticism from supporters as a result, and the Dane has now admitted how tough it was to decide to leave Stamford Bridge.    Having spent ten amazing years at this club, I felt now was the right time for a new beginning for me and my family,    he said in a statement.    Mentally the last few months have been tough as it   s not been an easy decision to leave this club and the fans.    I   m not the most talkative person so sometimes people don   t understand how much the club and the fans mean to me. I will miss the players, staff and everyone here. I wish the best for the club and the fans in the future.    Christensen joined the Chelsea academy in 2012 and leaves with 160 appearances to his name, as well as a Champions League winner's medal.    I had a tough decision to make at the age of 16 to leave Denmark,    Christensen continued.    I met many different clubs but there was only ever one choice for me and that was Chelsea. From the moment I arrived they made me feel at home, I   m grateful to Jim Fraser and Neil Bath who immediately embraced me as part of their family.
