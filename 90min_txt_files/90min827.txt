Lukaku also has interest from Saudi Arabia but has made it clear that his top priority is to remain with Inter. feed The Serie A side also hope to strike a deal to sign centre-back Koulibaly on loan, but the 31-year-old's high wages also pose an issue to any move and either Chelsea or Koulibaly would likely have to contribute.

In the opposite direction, Chelsea hope to strike a deal to sign goalkeeper Onana but now face rival interest from Manchester United, who are looking for more competition for David de Gea, United, managed by Onana's former Ajax boss Erik ten Hag, are tracking developments with Chelsea and Inter are hopeful of sparking an auction which would raise the goalkeeper's price.
