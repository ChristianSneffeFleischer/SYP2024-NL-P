Real Sociedad are looking to take Manchester United midfielder Donny van de Beek on loan with an option to buy, sources have confirmed to 90min. The Netherlands international has played 60 times for the Red Devils since joining from Ajax in 2020, though most of these appearances have come as a substitute and his last two seasons have been plagued by injuries. The arrival of Mason Mount from Chelsea has pushed Van de Beek further down the Old Trafford pecking order and Man Utd are open to a departure during the summer transfer window, with 90min reporting during July that he was considering his options. 90min understands that Spanish side Real Sociedad, who have qualified for the 2023/24 Champions League, have stepped forward and offered to take Van de Beek on loan with an optional purchase clause. feed Man Utd are aware of La Real's concerns over the knee injury which prematurely ended his 2022/23 season and so are willing to sanction a loan, with the two clubs in talks over the sum of the option to buy. Van de Beek is keen on a move to San Sebastian. Sources have told 90min that Man Utd are looking to free up space on their wage bill with the departures of Van de Beek and fellow midfielder Fred in order to push ahead with a move for Fiorentina's Sofyan Amrabat. 90min reported last month that Man Utd have held talks with the Italian side over a transfer, but face competition from Atletico Madrid. While their search for a new midfielder rumbles on, Man Utd will soon announce the signing of striker Rasmus Hojlund from Atalanta following his medical. The 20-year-old Denmark international will join for an initial  £64m fee, with add-ons potentially taking the total sum to just over  £72m.
