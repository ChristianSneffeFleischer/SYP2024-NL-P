Bayern Munich president Herbert Hainer has criticised Barcelona head coach Xavi for his admission of his desire to sign midfielder Joshua Kimmich. While Bayern have always been determined to keep hold of Kimmich, 90min understands that the German's representatives have spoken with clubs across Europe, including Barcelona, to gauge the interest in the midfielder. Xavi was asked about his side's interest in Kimmich last month and did not shy away from discussing his desire to work with the 28-year-old, telling Mundo Deportivo: "He is a super top player, who understands the game in a fantastic way. If there is an open door, there will be a negotiation with Bayern." His comments appear to have frustrated Hainer, who questioned Xavi's conduct in a recent interview with Sky Sports Germany. "First of all, Xavi was an excellent player and I have big respect for Barcelona," Hainer said. "But I don't understand why they're openly and offensively 'flirting' with our player. Joshua Kimmich is an absolute cornerstone for us." feed Confirming his desire to keep Kimmich, Haimer added: "Joshua is a leader, has won many titles with us and will also continue to win titles with us in the future. He's firmly in our plans for the future and one of the players to build the team around." Kimmich's situation has caught the attention of a number of Europe's top sides, with Manchester City also known admirers of the Germany international. However, he recently moved to calm the speculation on his future, insisting he still has 'big plans' for the future with Bayern. "It was difficult not to come across [the rumours]," he told BILD. "Generally, I   m not too invested in the rumours. "I still have, as everyone knows, two years left on my contract and we have big plans [for those two years] at Bayern."
