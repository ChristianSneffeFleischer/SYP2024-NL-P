Everton are closing in on the signing of Dynamo Kyiv left-back Vitaliy Mykolenko, with the 22-year-old undergoing a medical ahead of a    21m transfer. The Toffees have been hamstrung by Financial Fair Play regulations in recent windows, and were only able to spend  Â£1.7m on new players in the summer. But it seems their woes could be coming to an end with the signing of Mykolenko, with Fabrizio Romano reporting that he will complete a medical on Friday ahead of a move to Goodison Park. Mykolenko was part of Ukraine's squad which reached the quarter-finals at Euro 2020 before being knocked out by England, sharing the pitch with future teammate Dominic Calvert-Lewin. He has been a key figure for Dynamo Kyiv since breaking into the team in 2018, playing a vital role as they secured a Ukrainian league and cup double last season. Right.
