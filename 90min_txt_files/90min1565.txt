Barcelona manager Xavi has admitted his surprise towards hearing reports of a possible exit from Camp Nou for winger Ansu Fati. 90min understands that Fati's limited game time at Barcelona this season - just seven starts from a possible 20 in La Liga - has seen the player's representatives reach out to the Premier League's elite to alert them to the situation. Fati is thought to be frustrated with his current role and that message has been delivered to Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Tottenham and Newcastle United. However, president Joan Laporta recently shut down talk of a possible departure for Fati, and Xavi has now done the same.    At the moment, nobody is transferable," Xavi said. "The transfer market is over, I don   t know what we are doing talking about sales, we are playing for the season. "We are talking about the sale of Ansu, which has not been discussed in the whole month of January.    I don   t understand it and even less so in the Barcelona environment. I have a lot of hope for him.    Listen now as  Scott Saunders  hosts  Graeme Bailey  and  Toby Cudworth  to wrap up the January transfer window and discuss Enzo Fernandez, Moises Caicedo, Marcel Sabitzer, Hakim Ziyech's failed PSG move and more!
