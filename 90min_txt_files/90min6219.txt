Newcastle would have to make Nabil Bentaleb their highest earner alongside Jonjo Shelvey if they decide to make his transfer to the club permanent. Bentaleb joined Newcastle on loan from Schalke until the end of the season in January, and the Magpies have the option to make the deal permanent if they wish to do so. Bentaleb has proven to be a useful asset since arriving on Tyneside, bolstering Newcastle's midfield options with significant quality. According to local news outlet the Chronicle - backed up via German paper Bild - Bentaleb earns around  £80,000-per-week on his current deal.  If Newcastle take up the option to make his move permanent for a fee of  £8.6m, these wages would see him become the top earner next to captain Shelvey. The Algerian has made 14 appearances for the club since making the switch, but his significantly high wages has left officials with a lot to discuss in transfer meetings this week. Steve Bruce has already expressed the need to reign in the club's expenses this summer, which is seeing them rethink their transfer strategy. As well as Bentaleb, Newcastle are also mulling over the future of fellow loanees Danny Rose and Valentino Lazaro. The pair both joined in January also, and Bruce has expressed his happiness with all of their performances since joining the club. While Rose has made an impact in the starting XI alongside Bentaleb, however, Lazaro has been largely used as rotation. The Englishman has stated that he wishes to stay at Newcastle beyond his current loan deal, but uncertainty surrounding their financial status may result in him having to look elsewhere.
