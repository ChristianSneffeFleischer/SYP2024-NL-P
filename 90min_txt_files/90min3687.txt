Cadiz have agreed a deal with Barcelona and Sevilla to sign striker Luuk de Jong on a six-month loan, with the Dutchman now deciding on his future. Barcelona signed De Jong on summer transfer deadline day, but after taking a bit-part role under former boss Ronald Koeman, he has struggled for minutes following Xavi's return to Camp Nou and Barcelona are ready to cut his loan short. The problem is that Sevilla do not want De Jong back, meaning Barcelona have to find a team willing to take over the final six months of their loan contract. According to Mundo Deportivo, they have found that in Cadiz, who have struck a deal with both Barcelona and Sevilla to bring the towering Dutchman in for the remainder of the campaign. This report, which was later backed up by Catalunya Radio, states that all that is missing for this one is De Jong's approval, and there is no guarantee that he will accept the switch. Cadiz sit 19th in the La Liga table, with their return of 15 goals in 18 games the second-lowest in the entire division, although they are just one point adrift of safety as it stands. They do have five natural strikers on the books, but outside of Choco Lozano's five goals, Cadiz have struggled up top and Alvaro Negredo is the only other forward to have actually found the back of the net.
