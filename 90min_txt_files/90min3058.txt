West Ham United are continuing to keep tabs on Jesse Lingard and Adnan Januzaj with both players available on free transfers, 90min understands. Irons boss David Moyes has worked with both in the past and there is a chance of securing reunions with them at the London Stadium for next season. Lingard spent six memorable months on loan at West Ham in the 2020/21 campaign and the east Londoners have been keen on signing him permanently since. 90min understands that West Ham and Everton have made offers to Lingard following the expiration of his contract at Manchester United, but they are currently short of his wage demands. The 29-year-old has also held talks with Wayne Rooney's D.C. United regarding a potential move to the US. Meanwhile, Januzaj - who made his Man Utd breakthrough under Moyes before playing under the Scot at Sunderland - is also a free agent following the expiration of his Real Sociedad contract. After such a promising debut season at Old Trafford in which he scored four times, Januzaj has not bettered that tally in the league in the nine seasons that have followed. Listen now to 90min's Talking Transfers podcast, with  Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey,  Harry Symeou  &  Toby Cudworth.
