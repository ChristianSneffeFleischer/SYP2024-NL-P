Rayados de Monterrey have signed midfielder Jordi Cortizo from Club Puebla, ahead of the 2023 Liga MX Clausura.   He joins the Guadalajara team on a four-season contract, according to Diego Armando Medina of TUDN. "I have been delighted since the opportunity to come here was given, I always knew that I had to make a leap to these big leagues with one of the biggest clubs in Mexico," Cortizo said of his transfer.   Cortizo kicked off his professional career with Queretaro in 2017, recording four goals in 76 appearances over the course of three years before seeing stints with Tijuana and Puebla. He managed well in Liga MX, but it wasn   t until the 2022 Apertura that he became a standout.   The offensive midfielder recorded five goals in 20 overall matches to inspire Puebla to eighth on the table and the Liguilla quarterfinals.   Overall, Cortizo has 12 goals in 149 Liga MX appearances.   "They are going to see a player who always tries, that will never fail, who will go for the ball, will try to play, propose offensive play, go forward and who will always give himself up for the club. It is my dream to be champion of the Liga MX, there is no better option today than to be sitting here and with this squad to achieve it," he said. Cortizo stands as the first signing under new Monterrey president Jose Antonio Noriega, who replaced Duilio Davino   following the team   s elimination from the 2022 Apertura. Upon his arrival, Noriega insisted he needed to evaluate the team   s needs before making drastic changes.
