Chelsea are willing to grant Romelu Lukaku's wish to rejoin Inter this summer, even if only on an initial loan deal. Belgium's record goalscorer swapped San Siro for Stamford Bridge only one year ago but has failed to settle back in west London following his club-record  £97.5m switch. Bayern Munich are reading a new bid for Sadio Mane worth nearly  £35m. However, Liverpool are continuing to hold out for a fee of at least  £40m. Paul Pogba's free transfer from Manchester United to Juventus is all but complete and an announcement from the Turin club could come by the weekend. This will be the second time the Frenchman will have swapped Old Trafford for the Allianz Stadium in his career. Real Madrid are already planning to beat England's elite clubs to the signing of Jude Bellingham next summer and are preparing a package worth approximately    90m for the Borussia Dortmund starlet. Arsenal and Tottenham have joined Barcelona in the race to sign Raphinha from Leeds, with the Blaugrana continuing to stall over a deal for the Brazil forward. His international teammate, Richarlison, is said to prefer a move to either Spurs or Chelsea over Arsenal as Everton look to raise funds this summer. However, fellow Brazilian Gabriel Jesus has his eyes firmly set on a move to the Emirates Stadium and is hoping to reunite with former Manchester City assistant Mikel Arteta. Manchester United have firmed up their interest in Christian Eriksen, who is expected to leave Brentford later this month. Tottenham remain the frontrunners for his signature, however. Meanwhile, Frenkie de Jong has admitted that while he is flattered by the interest Manchester United have shown in him, he is happy at the 'biggest club in the world' in Barcelona. The Red Devils are also continuing to pursue Ajax winger Antony. Aurelien Tchouameni has admitted that Kylian Mbappe tried to persuade him to join Paris Saint-Germain, but he only wanted to sign for Real Madrid. Wolves are looking to freshen up their midfield with moves for Sporting CP's Joao Palhinha and Porto's Vitinha. Ruben Neves is expected to leave, with Manchester United and Barcelona keeping tabs on his situation.
