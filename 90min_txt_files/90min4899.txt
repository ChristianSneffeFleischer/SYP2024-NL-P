Talented youngster Jamal Musiala and his club Bayern Munich remain deadlocked in talks over a new deal, opening the door for a potential Premier League move next summer.  Musiala is enjoying a breakout campaign, smashing the Bayern records for youngest Bundesliga player and goalscorer already this season. Overall, the 17-year-old has made 18 appearances in all competitions this term, netting on three occasions.  He is currently on a youth contract at the Allianz Arena, which expires in summer 2022, and talks over extending his stay with Die Roten have not yet been successful. According to Goal, Musiala wants  Â£100,000-per-week, a figure that, perhaps understandably, Bayern have not yet matched during negotiations. With the situation rumbling on, Liverpool, Manchester United and Manchester City are all said to be monitoring things closely. Born in Stuttgart, Musiala spent the majority of his childhood in England and was on the books at Chelsea before being snapped up by the Bundesliga champions in 2019, despite the Blues offering their most lucrative scholarship deal ever in a bid to get him to stay.  Eligible to represent both England and Germany, Musiala has already been capped by the Three Lions at multiple youth levels, most recently making his debut for the Under-21s. A senior call up should not be far off either as he has seriously caught the eye for Bayern this season.  pic.twitter.com/J3MhcQm0Uc
