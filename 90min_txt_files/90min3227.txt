Sergio Romero is said to be 'interested' in returning to Manchester United, having only left the club last summer.

Romero spent last season at Serie A side Venezia but could not prevent them being relegated and he has now left the club having made 16 appearances. And the Manchester Evening News reports that Romero could be open to returning to Old Trafford this summer. However, United are yet to decide whether they will make a move for their former goalkeeper.
