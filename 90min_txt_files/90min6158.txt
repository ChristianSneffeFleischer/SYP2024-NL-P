Everton are targeting Real Madrid's Sergio Reguilon to bolster their options at left back, and reportedly lead the chase for the defender after putting in an  £18m bid. The Toffees are in the market for a new left back following the retirement of stalwart Leighton Baines at the end of the 2019/20 campaign. Lucas Digne is currently the only recognisable senior left back remaining at Goodison Park, and Everton have set their sights on Reguilon as the man to fill the void left by Baines. According to Sky Sports, the club have submitted an  £18m bid for the 23-year-old, which is expected to be the catalyst for a potential bidding war between a selection of sides. Reguilon has attracted attention from a host of clubs across Europe following his impressive loan spell with Sevilla during the 2019/20 season. The full-back helped Sevilla finish fourth and secure Champions League football, and he was voted the best left back in La Liga in the process. However, the Liverpool Echo report that Everton have in fact not tabled a bid. Although the club have lost Baines, they have promoted 19-year-old Niels Nkounkou to the Under-23 side in the hope that he will offer competition for Digne within a year. Reguilon is a product of the Real Madrid academy, and is held in high regard at the Bernabeu. However, he currently finds himself behind Marcelo and Ferland Mendy in the left back pecking order, and Real need to sell assets in order to help balance the books.
