Manchester City have completed the signing of Sandy MacIver from Everton, with the goalkeeper signing a three-year deal to keep her at the club until 2025. The move sees MacIver rejoin City following six years away, having spent a year in the City academy as a teenager between 2015 and 2016. The signing is City's fifth of the summer following the additions of Deyna Castellanos, Leila Ouahabi, Laia Aleixandri and Mary Fowler.     I   m really happy to be back here, this time as a professional player     Manchester City is a world class club across the board, and I   m very much looking forward to being a part of that," said MacIver.    I feel like it   s really important at this time in my career to take my game to the next level and being able to train and learn from the world-class players and coaches here will help me to do that.    It   s a really ambitious club who aspire to win trophies on a regular basis, and that   s something I   m excited to be involved in over the coming seasons.    The 24-year-old departs Everton following 18 months with the Toffees. One of her most memorable moments ironically came against City, with MacIver turning in a player of the match performance against Gareth Taylor's side during the 2019/20 FA Cup final at Wembley. The arrival of MacIver will offer much needed strength in depth in the goalkeeper department for City, after Karen Bardsley retired and Karima Benameur Taieb was released following the conclusion of her contract this summer. She will compete for a starting berth with fellow England international Ellie Roebuck.
