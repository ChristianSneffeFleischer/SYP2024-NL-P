Chelsea are aware that Barcelona have made contact with Jules Kounde regarding a summer transfer but his representatives have not yet signalled that he will turn down a move to Stamford Bridge, 90min understands. The Blues reached a  Â£55m agreement with Sevilla for Kounde on Friday, though it was then reported in Spain that Bar  a were finally willing to make an official bid for the defender, if only to slow down an exit from Andalusia to England. 90min reported earlier on Saturday that both Chelsea and Sevilla remained confident of finalising a deal for Kounde in the coming days. And it is understood that Thomas Tuchel's side are still hopeful of concluding a deal despite further reports on the continent saying Kounde will head to Camp Nou instead. They are very much aware that Barcelona are in contact with Kounde, but the player has not signalled to them that he won't end up signing for the west London side.
