Gerard Pique has criticised former club Barcelona for financial mismanagement after they missed out on the chance to re-sign Lionel Messi. The Argentine legend was available on a free transfer following the expiration of his contract at Paris Saint-Germain - a club where he spent two inconsistent seasons - and Bar  a had been incredibly confident of re-signing him this summer. Messi has instead joined MLS club Inter Miami, admitting in an interview with Mundo Deportivo and SPORT that the financial issues at Barcelona led to his decision. He said: "I heard it was said La Liga had accepted that everything was fine for me to return, there were still many other things that had to be done.  I heard that [Barcelona] had to sell players or lower player salaries and the truth is that I didn't want to go through that." manual Speaking at a Kings League event, Messi's ex-teammate and Barcelona legend Pique lambasted his former club for the financial issues that led to the club missing out on signing the greatest footballer of all time. "I'm glad I left because I gave Bar  a space on the salary scale. But it seems that, despite this, there are still financial problems. I wonder who should go now. They said that we are responsible for our salaries [Pique, Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba].
