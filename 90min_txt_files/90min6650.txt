Paris Saint-Germain defender Thiago Silva will leave the club when his current deal expires on 30 June, following a phone call with sporting director Leonardo.  The captain made the switch to Paris in the summer of 2012 and has since made 310 appearances for the club. During his time with Les Parisiens, he has helped his side to seven Ligue 1 trophies, while he has also won the Coupe de France four times and the Coupe de la Ligue five times.   However, L'Equipe now report that the 35-year-old will leave the club once his current deal expires, bringing to an end his eight-year stay in Paris. The club's sporting director Leonardo recently called the central defender to inform him that the club will not be extending his current contract, which is due to expire on 30 June.  Despite now being in the final stages of his career, Silva has intentions to play at the next World Cup and he was 'expecting' a new two-year deal to arrive. Both he and his family enjoy life in Paris, but the club have made the decision to cut ties with their captain.  Regarded as one of the best - if not the best - defenders in PSG's history, the loss of Thiago Silva will be felt next season. However, with the Brazilian now departing and with teammate Edinson Cavani's future still up in the air, L'Equipe note that the Ligue 1 outfit are looking to set the stage for a 'new wave'.  Silva could still prove to be a shrewd acquisition for any club, considering his vast experience and leadership qualities both on and off the field. The Brazilian has been linked with a move back to Milan, while there is also interest from the Premier League.
