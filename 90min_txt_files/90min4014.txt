Juventus may have to choose between signing Manuel Locatelli or Miralem Pjanic this summer, with the club   s budget not expected to stretch to both unless other sales are made first. Having resurrected his club career with Sassuolo after leaving AC Milan at a young age, Locatelli has emerged as a major target since impressing for Italy at Euro 2020. Arsenal are also interested in the 23-year-old, but his preference is known to be Juve. The Premier League side are thought to be willing to offer more and meet Sassuolo   s    40m asking price, with Juve   s initial approach taking the form of a loan plus    30m obligation to buy. Unsurprisingly, the latter wasn   t deemed acceptable by Sassuolo, but an agreement between the two Serie A sides has since been described as    close   . The possibility of Pjanic returning to Juve has also surfaced. The Bosnia international moved to Barcelona only last summer as part of a deal that saw Arthur head to Turin, a transfer arrangement designed to help ease Bar  a   s dire financial situation. But with the Catalans still desperate to raise cash and slash wage costs in order to comply with La Liga   s salary cap rules, which currently prevent them from registering Lionel Messi   s new contract, Pjanic is one of those earmarked for sale and Juve could take advantage. Pjanic was a success during four trophy-lade seasons in Turin and the possibility of his return has already been rumoured to have met the approval of returning head coach Massimiliano Allegri.
