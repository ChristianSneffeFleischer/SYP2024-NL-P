Ajax winger Antony has confessed that he does not know whether Manchester United will make a move to sign him this summer. The Brazilian has been United's preferred attacking target all summer but talks hit a major stumbling block earlier this summer as Ajax dug their feet in and demanded a fee of around    100m, prompting United to take a step back. With talks making little progress, Antony began the season with Ajax and has been in dazzling form thus far. He bagged a goal and an assist in a 6-1 thumping of Groningen, but his display went under the radar somewhat because of a hat-trick from former Tottenham man Steven Bergwijn. After the game, Antony spoke to NOS about United's interest and a possible reunion with Erik ten Hag.    Will Ten Hag call me? No idea," the winger said. "He will have to call my agents, I'm focused on here. What will come will come, we'll see." He added:    I feel good at Ajax. I give everything for this club, every minute. I love this city and this club."
