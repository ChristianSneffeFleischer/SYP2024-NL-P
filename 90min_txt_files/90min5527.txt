Bayern Munich have reignited their interest in Chelsea forward Callum Hudson-Odoi, according to reports in Germany. Die Roten previously targeted the England international back in 2019, coming very close to securing a deal before he signed a contract extension at Stamford Bridge.  According to Bild, Bayern are ready to once again make a ploy for Hudson-Odoi, albeit only on loan. Hansi Flick has made clear his desire to bring in another winger to relieve the pressure on Leroy Sane, Serge Gnabry and Kingsley Coman.  Sporting director Hasan Salihamidzic is keen to fulfil Flick's wish, and Hudson-Odoi has been earmarked as the ideal short term solution.  Bayern previously explored the option of signing Atletico Madrid's Thomas Lemar, but concluded that the deal did not make sense financially. Negotiations over the signing of Hoffenheim forward Andrej Kramaric were dropped for the same reason.  Bayern have already spent just over  Â£40m on San   this summer and after a big spend during the last summer window, they are on the lookout for cheaper finds.  Hudson-Odoi represents a fairly well priced deal and the player could be interested in making the switch to the Bundesliga. Competition for places is set to be fierce at Chelsea this season thanks to the vast array of attacking talent at Frank Lampard's disposal.
