Nottingham Forest have no intention of selling star forward Brennan Johnson this summer, 90min understands. After dazzling in the Championship, the 22-year-old Welshman enjoyed a productive debut campaign in the Premier League, racking up eight goals and three assists in 38 games as Forest booked their place in the division for next season. Interest in Johnson has been mounting over the past 12 months and Brentford are believed to have made contact over a possible move for the forward. Reports of a bid are premature but 90min understands that Forest would waste little time in shooting down an offer if it did arrive. Forest are determined to keep hold of Johnson this summer and value the young forward at well over  Â£50m - a fee they hope will be enough to scare off any suitors. feed Forest see Johnson, who came through the club's academy and signed a new four-year contract just last summer, as a future superstar and have no desire to part ways with the Welsh international ahead of their second season back in the top flight. Plans are also being made for Forest to bolster at the back, with talks on over a permanent move for goalkeeper Dean Henderson. The 26-year-old spent last season on loan at the City Ground and could be brought back on a long-term deal following the expiry of Keylor Navas' own temporary deal with Forest. Steve Cooper's side spent heavily last summer and owners are still looking to bolster the squad ahead of the coming campaign.
