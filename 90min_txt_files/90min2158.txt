DC United are targeting Leeds United midfielder Mateusz Klich as part of their January transfer plans, according to reports. Wayne Rooney is hard at work rebuilding his roster after the Black and Red finished bottom of the overall standings in 2022, winning just seven of 34 matches and taking only 27 points - although Rooney only took over from Hernan Losada over midway through the season. DC United have already added Iraq international defender Mohanad Jeahze and experienced goalkeeper Tyler Miller to their ranks this winter, and Polish journalist Piotr Kozminski reports that Klich is the latest player in their sights. Kozminski states that DC United will face competition from Belgian side Royal Antwerp for the signature of Klich, who has 18 months left to run on his current deal with Premier League side Leeds United.

Despite talking up the midfielder's popularity within the squad, Marsch did reveal 'some conversations' have been held regarding a possible transfer.
