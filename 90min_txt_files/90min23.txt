Brighton & Hove Albion have opened talks with Lille over the transfer of midfield starlet Carlos Baleba, 90min understands. Baleba is regarded as one of the top young midfield prospects in Ligue 1 and Brighton are one of several sides who have been following him for months. 90min revealed in March that they were one of a number of Premier League clubs who were scouting the highly-rated teenager. With Moises Caicedo ready to depart the club for Chelsea for a British-record  £115m fee, Brighton are looking for his replacement and they have opted for Baleba. feed Cameroon-born Baleba has been with Lille since 2022 when they picked him up from the Ecole de Football des Brasseries academy. He quickly progressed into the first-team and helped replace Amadou Onana last summer after he joined Everton. Now, Baleba is set to follow in Onana's foot-steps to the Premier League. Sources have confirmed to 90min that Lille are looking for a fee of around    30m ( £25.8m) and a deal is now close between the two clubs, with his representatives finalising personal terms. Baleba featured in Lille's opening game of the season on Friday as they claimed a 1-1 draw at Nice, but that is set to be his final appearance for the club ahead of a move to Brighton this week.
