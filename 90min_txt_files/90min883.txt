Dutch champions Feyenoord have secured deals for Premier League duo Yankuba Minteh and Antef Tsoungui. Newcastle have just confirmed Minteh's arrival from Danish side OB in a deal worth around  Â£6m and the young forward has agreed to join the Dutch champions on loan next season. Magpies sporting director Dan Ashworth said: "We are very pleased to be bringing a player with Yankuba's high potential to Newcastle United. "We look forward to working with him in this exciting phase of his development, and we're excited to see how he performs at Feyenoord, a club that also has a strong development record of its own. feed "As well as supporting the first team with players for the here and now, we have a clear philosophy to invest in emerging talent and we want to provide a player pathway that will help to build and sustain long-term success." Also joining Feyenoord is Belgian defender Tsoungui, who has signed a permanent two-year deal from Brighton. The 20-year-old joined the Seagulls in 2018 from Chelsea and made one first-team appearance for the club in the League Cup, before spending last season on loan with Belgian side Lommel. Brighton technical director David Weir explained: "This represents a fantastic move for Antef, to be joining the Dutch league winners, and we wish him the best of luck for the future."
