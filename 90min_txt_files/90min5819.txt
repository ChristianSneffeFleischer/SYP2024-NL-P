Bayer Leverkusen have confirmed that Kai Havertz has left Germany's Nations League training camp to fly to London and complete his transfer to Chelsea - in what will be a club-record move.  The Blues are on course to spend a Premier League record summer total this window, as the forward nears his move from Leverkusen in a deal that could amount to  £90m. Chelsea have already brought in Timo Werner, Hakim Ziyech, Ben Chilwell, Thiago Silva and Malang Sarr this summer for a total outlay of near  £130m. Mateo Kovacic's loan move from Real Madrid being made permanent was the only piece of transfer business the club concluded in the previous two windows.

Sporting director Rudi V  ller expressed his gratitude to the national team for granting permission for him to leave the camp. "We are grateful to the national coach that Kai can now sort things out with our support on site in London," he said. Havertz had been with two of his future teammates over the last few days in Antonio R  diger and Werner, the pair both starting in Die Mannschaft's 1-1 draw with Spain on Thursday evening. An initial offer of    80m ( £72m) to be paid up front was accepted by the Bundesliga side, with Leverkusen's    100m valuation to be met with a further    20m in add-ons that will bring the overall total to    100m ( £90m). This fee will surpass the club's current record deal, the  £72m paid to sign goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga two summers ago.  Excited for the national team! ?? A post shared by  Kai Havertz ?         ?

The 21-year-old has been one of Germany and Europe's standout talents over the past two seasons, scoring 38 goals and registering 16 assists during that time. Despite his contribution, Leverkusen missed out on a Champions League berth for the upcoming season, finishing two points shy of Borussia M  nchengladbach in fifth.
