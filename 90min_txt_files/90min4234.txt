Well, well, well. The transfer that's been dominating the gossip columns for what seems an eternity has finally become reality. This is how long the Jadon Sancho transfer took #ManchesterUnited pic.twitter.com/xfB7OWme5y It's recently been reported that Jadon Sancho will agree terms with Manchester United in the coming days and make the rumour that so many for so long have been praying to become reality...actually true. Sancho will join United from Borussia Dortmund - maybe pinch yourself United fans...just to make sure. TRUE     @Sanchooo10 to @ManUtd is a done Deal! Agreement between @BVB and United. Signature of the contracts in the coming days @westsven @BILD_Sport As expected, the topic instantly trended on Twitter, with a storm of football fans taking to the social media platform to voice their opinions. Some came out in force to belittle the deal and give it their best shot at bringing down the understandably buzzing Red Devils fans. 90m for Sancho who's behind a 19 year old Saka for England.

Not that saving money is the most important thing... But 35m saved on Jadon Sancho in 12 months. And United fans already want more...and quick!
