Tottenham Hotspur are considering a move for Rennes forward M'Baye Niang as their search for a backup to Harry Kane continues. The Senegal international has been in fine form over the last two seasons in France, notching 14 times in all competitions last season, followed up by a further 15 goals this term before the Ligue  1 season was cancelled. As for Spurs, their well-known desire to sign attacking reinforcements has seen them linked with a number of striking options in their quest to ease the goalscoring burden on the often-injured England captain.  Auguri @acmilan per i tuoi 120 anni di Gloria! Felice di aver preso parte di questa bellissima storia #passion120 #milano #cuorerossonero A post shared by  M'Baye Niang Officiel (@mbaye_niang11) on Dec 16, 2019 at 9:23am PST L'Equipe report that former AC Milan striker Niang may be the answer to Spurs' prayers, with the club opening talks to potentially sign the 25-year-old. However, per the report, Jos   Mourinho's side are not the only interested party, as French side Marseille - managed by former Spurs boss Andr   Villas-Boas - have also been in contact with Rennes about their star man. With Villas-Boas position at the club perhaps uncertain though, a move to London may offer a more stable option, despite the presence of Kane. The former Torino striker has previously spent time in the English top flight with Watford, his six-month loan spell with the Hornets seeing him register just two Premier League goals. While he may have had an impressive last few years in French football, the forward has perhaps not lived up to the early hype that surrounded him at San Siro. However, that being said, his ability to lead the line - and offer an option out wide - may be appealing to Mourinho and co, while he may only command a fee of  Â£15m.
