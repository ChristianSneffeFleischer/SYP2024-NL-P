Polish winger Bartosz Kapustka has been given the chance to end his Leicester City nightmare and move to Ekstraklasa champions Legia Warsaw.  Kapustka, who joined Leicester in 2016, has seen his career come to a halt, having made just three appearances in four years for the Foxes, none of those coming in the Premier League. And now the 23-year old has been given a lifeline by Legia Warsaw owner Dariusz Mioduski. As quoted by Leicester Mercury, Mioduski said:    He still has a one-year contract with Leicester. Bartek [Kapustka] is a perfect example of a footballer who should have played in Legia at least a year ago. If he wants to rebuild with us, we invite him.    Should Kapustka accept the offer     and, more importantly, should Leicester and the Polish side agree a fee     he will be playing Champions League football next season, after Legia Warsaw won their 14th league title this season. The Poland international has made no secret of his desire to leave in the past. Speaking to Canal+ (via The Mirror), Kapustka said:    The club knows that I want to play football regularly. I would like to leave in the summer 100 per cent. You can't make a slave out of an employee.
