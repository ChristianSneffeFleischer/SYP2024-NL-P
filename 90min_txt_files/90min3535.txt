Fiorentina president Rocco Commisso has lambasted Dusan Vlahovic and his agent following the forward's controversial move to Juventus.  Vlahovic was linked with clubs across Europe throughout the January window - notably Arsenal and Tottenham - but made a shock    75m move to Fiorentina's arch rivals Juve at the tail end of the window.  Speaking to the club's official website about the Roberto Baggio-style move from Florence to Turin, club president Commisso detailed how the deal came to be, stating that Vlahovic had planned to 'ruin' La Viola:     It was clear to everyone he already had a deal with someone. He said no to every offer. I went to England many times, each time he said no.    Vlahovic wanted to remain until his contract ran down and ruin Fiorentina." Commisso also branded Vlahovic's agents 'liars' and insisted the they were using the club for their own financial gain:    His agents wanted a 10% cut of the transfer fee and exclusive rights to negotiate his next move. They wanted to make money off us, so selling him now was an excellent operation.
