Leicester City are continuing to demand  £60m for Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur transfer target James Maddison, sources have told 90min. The Foxes were relegated from the Premier League on the final day of the 2022/23 season despite Maddison returning to form during the campaign, registering ten goals and nine assists in 30 games. The 26-year-old also recaptured his place in the England squad having been selected by Gareth Southgate for the 2022 FIFA World Cup as well as their Euro 2024 qualifiers in March and June. Maddison wants to leave Leicester but they are playing hard-ball in talks with interested parties Newcastle and Tottenham. Sources have confirmed to 90min that the Foxes are asking for  £60m for Maddison and they are not actively pushing for an exit at this point, hoping that other clubs will enter the race. 90min reported in April that Liverpool were exploring a move for Maddison as part of their midfield overhaul. Arsenal and Manchester United had also looked into a deal earlier this year. feed But Newcastle and Tottenham's interest is firm and long-standing - the Magpies had multiple bids rejected by Leicester last summer, while Spurs have been linked with Maddison ever since he broke through at Coventry City in the mid-2010s. Tottenham opened direct talks with Leicester earlier this month and have signalled a willingness to make Maddison one of their highest earners. Spurs face the Foxes in a pre-season friendly in Thailand on July 23. Newcastle are yet to make a firm offer to Leicester but they remain in talks and are aware of the  £60m price tag, though are reluctant to meet that figure and pay more than the  £50m offered last summer.
