Bar  a have badly struggled financially for the last few years, exacerbated further by the Covid-19 pandemic.

Freixa, who ran for the presidency against Josep Maria Bartomeu in 2015 and against Joan Laporta last year, has suggested that potential deals for Robert Lewandowski, Jules Kounde, Raphinha and Bernardo Silva will be beyond the club   s means this summer.
