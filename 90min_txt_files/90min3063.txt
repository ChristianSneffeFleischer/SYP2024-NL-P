Nathan Ake's prospective move from Manchester City to Chelsea has collapsed as the two clubs could not agree on the structure of the transfer, 90min understands.  Ake had seemed close to returning to Stamford Bridge this summer, having spent five years with Chelsea prior to joining Bournemouth in 2017. As reported by 90min, the two clubs had agreed a  Â£45m fee for the defender and a medical was booked in, but the deal has now fallen through. City are understood to have wanted the full sum paid upfront, but Chelsea were only willing to offer it in instalments.  Neither side showed a willingness to soften their stance and the move has collapsed as a result.  Although City had been willing to let Ake depart should he desire it, they are happy with the defender and will not force him out of the club this summer.  Despite missing out on one of their targets, Chelsea should be welcoming some new defenders to the club soon.  90min understands that the Blues are preparing to announce the arrival of Kalidou Koulibaly imminently and they are also interested in Paris Saint-Germain's Presnel Kimpembe.
