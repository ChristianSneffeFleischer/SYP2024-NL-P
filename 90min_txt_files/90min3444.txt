Barcelona defender Ronald Araujo has not taken kindly to the Blaugrana's pursuits to sign new centre-backs this summer, particularly Chelsea duo Andreas Christensen and Antonio Rudiger. Araujo's contract expires at the end of the 2022/23 season and he has not agreed fresh terms with Bar  a just yet, while he has been heavily linked with a move to Manchester United in recent months. Barcelona's most recent contract offer would see Araujo quadruple his wages, though he would still remain one of the lowest-paid members of the first team. And Sport now report the Uruguayan's camp have learned Barcelona have offered a much bigger salary in order to bring Christensen to the club this summer - a deal club president Joan Laporta all but confirmed last week - while their aggressive interest in Rudiger hasn't gone down well either. The Catalan club are also keen to sign a third Chelsea defender in Cesar Azpilicueta, despite an extension clause in his contract kicking in recently.
