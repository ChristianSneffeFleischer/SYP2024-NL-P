Chelsea head coach Mauricio Pochettino has responded to the club's alleged interest in Kylian Mbappe. Paris Saint-Germain are looking to sell Mbappe this summer after he informed them he would not be extending his contract beyond 2024. 90min understands that Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal have had a world-record  Â£259m bid for the forward accepted by PSG, though he will need convincing in order to leave Europe despite the offer of a lucrative contract. Though Mbappe is ultimately holding out for a move to Real Madrid, he has been heavily linked with other clubs across Europe such as Chelsea. However, sources have told 90min that this has come from intermediaries acting on behalf of PSG in order to find an alternative buyer. Pochettino, who worked with Mbappe at PSG from 2020 to 2022, was asked about Chelsea's links with the 24-year-old in a press conference prior to the Blues' pre-season friendly against Newcastle United. manual "I think in our past we were at Paris Saint-Germain and with Kylian and think I need to be conscious that I cannot talk," Pochettino said. "Everything you talk is too much noise. It is a situation that is very delicate and one they need to fix in Paris with Kylian. For our side, I have nothing to say." He added: "We are working on our reality, our reality is different. From my side, nothing to say, only to support them. "I hope they find a solution for both sides. It is a club that I love because I was a player, a captain and a coach. With Kylian we created a very good relationship, I hope they can find the best solution for both sides." While Chelsea will not be entering the sweepstakes for Mbappe, 90min understands they are discussing personal terms with Ajax forward Mohammed Kudus.
