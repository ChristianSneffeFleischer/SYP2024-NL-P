Tottenham Hotspur remain in talks with Sporting CP over a potential deal for Pedro Porro, sources have told 90min. Spurs are in the hunt for reinforcements at right wing-back as they look to turn their season around following a poor run of domestic form. Head coach Antonio Conte is known for his three-at-the-back system featuring pacy wing-backs - something his squad has largely lacked during his time in north London. That has led Tottenham to Porro, who 90min first revealed they were targeting back in December. The Spaniard played well in two Champions League outings against Spurs earlier this season. Sporting have long been adamant that the 23-year-old, who completed a permanent transfer to the club after two successful loan spells from Manchester City, will only be sold if his    45m release clause is met. Tottenham have been unwilling to pay that sum up front and would rather pay it over several instalments. 90min understands some within the Sporting hierarchy now feel that this would be an acceptable condition, though others - including head coach Ruben Amorim - remains opposed to it. Spurs want to make sure they've done all they feel they can in their pursuit of Porro before they move on to other targets before the transfer deadline on January 31. Inter's Denzel Dumfries remains on their radar, as does Wolves' out-of-contract Adama Traore.
