Tottenham have agreed a    30m fee with Barcelona for the transfer of right back Emerson Royal. Spurs have been on the hunt for a new player on the right side of the defence this summer, with neither Serge Aurier or Matt Doherty impressing last season. Japhet Tanganga has featured there in each of their opening three Premier League games, playing particularly well in the opening day victory against Manchester City.

Talks are ongoing over personal terms to complete the deal. That news means Aurier could secure a move elsewhere before the transfer window closes. The Ivory Coast international was close to rejoining Paris Saint-Germain earlier in the summer and only has one year remaining on his contract. He has been linked with Lille, but a potential move to France would depend on Zeki Celik leaving. Atletico Madrid were interested in the 24-year-old, but so far no agreement has been reached. Aurier himself distanced himself from the move due to his links to Lille's rivals Lens, stating on social media: "Blood and gold for life, you know it." Emerson joined Barcelona in 2019 but it was a joint deal with fellow La Liga side Real Betis which saw the two clubs pay half each of the    12.7m transfer fee given to Atletico Mineiro. He spent just over two seasons with Betis before Bar  a exercised their option to bring him back to Camp Nou for    9m. The Catalan giants are notoriously cash strapped, meaning they're happy to part ways this summer.
