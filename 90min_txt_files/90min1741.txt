Nottingham Forest have reached out to Keylor Navas over a January move away from Paris Saint-Germain, 90min can confirm. Forest's first-choice goalkeeper, Manchester United loanee Dean Henderson, has been sidelined with a thigh problem and so the Premier League newcomers are exploring their options as they continue their battle to avoid relegation. Sources have confirmed to 90min that those in charge at Forest have made contact with Navas over an ambitious move to the Premier League this month. Navas rotated with Gianluigi Donnarumma at PSG last season but the Costa Rica star has since been firmly benched by Christophe Galtier, who has used Navas just twice this season in the Coupe de France. With the 36-year-old no longer playing regular minutes, Forest have reached out with an offer that would see Navas move to the City Ground this month. Talks between Forest and PSG are yet to make any progress, however, with Navas' enormous wage packet expected to be a significant issue in negotiations. Listen now as  Scott Saunders  hosts  Graeme Bailey  and  Toby Cudworth  to discuss the latest transfer news. On today's agenda: Dusan Vlahovic, Anthony Gordon, Enzo Fernandes, Amadou Onana, Malo Gusto, Nicolo Zaniolo, Pedro Porro, Weston McKennie, Milan Skriniar, Maiximo Perrone & more!

Navas was targeted by Napoli during the summer but wages were again an issue, with the director of the Serie A side, Cristiano Giuntoli, claiming the goalkeeper earns    15m ( Â£13.2m) in gross salary per season. Talks with Napoli ultimately collapsed and Navas has spent the last six months on the sidelines as a result, with just two cup games as his only contribution to PSG's season so far.
