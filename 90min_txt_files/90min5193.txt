Eduardo Camavinga has left his representation, sparking a tug of war between football's biggest 'super-agents' to add him to their portfolio ahead of his next big transfer. The wonderkid has swiftly become one of the hottest properties on the planet since enjoying a breakthrough 2019/2020 campaign at Rennes.  The 18-year-old has continued to impress this season, making 11 appearances in all competitions including two in the Champions League. He also won his maiden France cap in September, marking his debut by scoring a sensational overhead kick.  This has only increased interest in the midfielder and his suitors will be following Camavinga's agent situation closely.  According to AS, the youngster has left his current agent, Moussa Sissoko, and will now be represented by his father, Celestino. However, several infamous intermediaries are said to be interested in working with him in the future.  Jorge Mendes - whose clients include Cristiano Ronaldo, Bernardo Silva and Fabinho - is sniffing around, as is Gareth Bale's agent Jonathan Barnett. Pini Zahavi, who was one of the key intermediaries involved in Neymar's record breaking transfer to Paris Saint-Germain, is also interested. As Barnett and Mendes has conducted significant business with Real Madrid in the past, Camavinga opting to be represented by either of them should strengthen Los Blancos' chances of securing his signature. Real have long been interested in signing the France international, with 90min revealing that he is a priority target for the club - along with Kylian Mbappe and Paul Pogba - back in October. They could even make a move for him in January with Camavinga refusing to rule out leaving Rennes in the near future during a recent interview.
