PSV Eindhoven are looking to beat a host of Premier League clubs to Villarreal winger Arnaut Danjuma and take him back to his native Netherlands this month, sources have confirmed to 90min. The Dutch international forward spent a large part of his youth career in Eindhoven but left for NEC Nijmegen in 2016 before making his debut for the first-team. Danjuma is now looking to leave Villarreal this month following Unai Emery's departure to Aston Villa, and he is currently in England considering offers to move back to the Premier League, having previously been a  Â£14m signing for Bournemouth in 2019. Everton and Southampton are both keen on the 25-year-old, who had a starring role as Villarreal reached last season's Champions League semi-finals. Emery has also shown an interest in reuniting with Danjuma at Villa, but his former club Bournemouth have been leading the chase so far. On this edition of Talking Transfers, Scott Saunders hosts Toby Cudworth & Graeme Bailey to discuss all the big transfer stories. This week's agenda includes Jude Bellingham, Harry Kane, Declan Rice, Hakim Ziyech, Leandro Trossard, Pedro Porro, Mykhaylo Mudryk and more!
