Chelsea are ready to make an offer for Leicester City's highly-rated defender Wesley Fofana, 90min understands. Thomas Tuchel has wanted three new central defenders to be brough in this summer following the loss of Antonio Rudiger, Andreas Christensen and Kurt Zouma in the last 12-months. Napoli's Kalidou Koulibaly has been brought in, but they have come up short in other pursuits having failed to land Matthijs De Ligt and Nathan Ake - whilst their bid for Jules Kounde has also stalled.  90min understands that Chelsea had agreed a  Â£55m fee with Sevilla for the defender, but Barcelona's interest has put a spanner in the works of any deal as the player looks inclined to move to Catalunya. With that in mind, the club have begun to look elsewhere for a new centre-back signing, and 90min revealed earlier this week that Villarreal's Pau Torres, Inter's Milan Skriniar, RB Leipzig's Josko Gvardiol and Bayern Munich duo Dayot Upamecano and Benjamin Pavard were all on their radar. Now 90min can confirm that Chelsea have also been looking at Premier League options and  the talented Fofana has caught their eye and the club's co-owner interim sporting director Todd Boehly is ready to open talks. The Foxes stopper spent the majority of last season out injured after suffering a broken leg during a pre-season friendly against Villarreal. After coming back from the injury however, the 21-year-old impressed, making 12 appearances in all competitions.  Fofana, who has previously been linked with the likes of Real Madrid and Barcelona, signed a new long-term contract earlier this summer tying him to the King Power Stadium to 2027.
