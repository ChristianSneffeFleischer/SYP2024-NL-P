A post shared by  Manchester United (@manchesterunited) on Jun 1, 2020 at 3:33am PDT But a rumoured breakthrough in talks with parent club Shanghai Shenhua has now yielded a formal agreement that extend Ighalo   s boyhood dream for close to another seven months. Formerly of Watford, Ighalo joined United as a relief option primarily for FA Cup and Europa League games and scored four times in eight appearances prior to coronavirus shutting down football. The club have described the news as a    timely boost    for manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer ahead of the restart of the Premier League season later this month. Speaking back in February about what had been a surprise January deal, Ighalo said,    It's a dream come true because since I was a kid I followed and dreamt of Manchester United. But it is a reality now. "Obviously, I am happy to be in Manchester first of all.  This is a great opportunity for me and I am grateful to God, and to my agent, and the coach who has given me this opportunity to be here.    There is, however, contrasting information around whether or not United have an option to make the deal permanent. BBC Sport's Simon Stone, upon the revealing of the news, suggested that the move does not include any kind of agreement. Manchester United will also have a buy option to sign Ighalo on a permanent deal on January 2021, at the end of the loan. ? #MUFC #ManUnited #transfers
