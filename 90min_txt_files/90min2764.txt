Inter manager Simone Inzaghi has stressed that the club plan to hold on to defenders Denzel Dumfries and Milan Skriniar this summer. 90min understands that Chelsea have held talks over a possible deal for Dumfries but have not yet followed up their interest amid concerns over Inter's    40m price tag for the Dutchman, who is seen as solid cover for Reece James at right-back. Meanwhile, Paris Saint-Germain have long been keen on Skriniar but have also baulked at Inter's high asking price. After Inter's victory over Lecce on Saturday, Inzaghi insisted that neither player will be leaving San Siro before the end of the summer. "I'm not laughing about transfers because we are in a situation where I see other teams buying every day while my Inter are said to be selling by the papers," Inzaghi told Sky Italy. "Have I had any signs from the owners that there may be sales? Absolutely not, but I want to reiterate that this is our team for the season and we only need one new central defender to replace [Andrea] Ranocchia and that's it."
