Everton are closing in on a deal worth over  £20m for Blackburn Rovers forward Ben Brereton-Diaz, sources have confirmed to 90min. A host of clubs - including foreign sides Sevilla and Nice - have been looking at Chile international Brereton-Diaz following a brilliant campaign last season which saw him bag 22 goals in the Championship. West Ham, Leeds, Wolves, Southampton and Bournemouth are among the Premier League clubs to take a keen interest in the 23-year-old, but now Everton are in pole position to land him. Brereton-Diaz has just a year left on his current deal and having rejected a new deal at Ewood Park, Blackburn are now looking to sell. Everton have put together a deal that would see them pay a guaranteed  £17.5m, with further instalments to take the deal beyond  £20m. The Toffees are working hard to bolster their ranks and are looking to bring in at least two new forwards. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey,  Toby Cudworth  and  Harry Symeou  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Antony attempting to push through a move to Man Utd, Frenkie de Jong and Pierre-Emerick Aubayemang's futures at Barcelona and Arsenal's interest in Pedro Neto.
