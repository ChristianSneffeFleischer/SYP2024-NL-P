American right-back DeAndre Yedlin is one of several players who will be allowed to depart St. James' Park before the transfer window shuts.  Newcastle have been very active over the summer break, bringing in the likes of Callum Wilson, Ryan Fraser and Jamal Lewis, but now Steve Bruce is focusing on trimming his squad with the departures of numerous fringe players a priority. Speaking to the Northern Echo, Bruce said: "I   ve got 28 [outfield players], and I   ve got to whittle that down to 22."    I   ve only got Matty Longstaff, who is young enough [not to count towards the squad numbers]. There   s going to be three, four, five people hanging around, unfortunately. They need to go and play somewhere. Over the next few weeks before the deadline, we   ve got to move people out.    The USA international full-back has made more than 100 Premier League appearances since making the leap across the pond back in 2014, following a  Â£2.3m move from MLS outfit Seattle Sounders to Tottenham.  A move to the north east followed two years later, although a loan spell at the Magpies' fiercest rivals Sunderland was sandwiched in-between, but he fell out of favour last season under new boss Bruce.  The 27-year-old made 20 appearances in all competitions throughout the 2019/20 campaign, scoring one goal and failing to provide any assists for his teammates. However, only ten of those appearances came in the starting lineup in a top-flight match.
