Barcelona midfielder Sergio Busquets has denied offering to leave Camp Nou during the January transfer window. Reports in Busquets' native Spain recently claimed the 34-year-old had approached those in charge at Barcelona over a possible exit in January, not because he wanted to leave, but rather in an attempt to help the team both on and off the pitch. Speaking to Marca, however, the Spain captain laughed off the whole story. "I speak a lot with the coach and with the president," Busquets explained. "I like to feel useful, not like a problem.
