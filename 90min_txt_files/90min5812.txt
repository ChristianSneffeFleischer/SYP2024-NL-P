AC Milan have completed the transfer of midfielder Brahim Di  z from Real Madrid on a season-long loan. The Spaniard joined Real from Manchester City in January 2019 for a fee of over  Â£15m but has since managed only 21 appearances for Zinedine Zidane's side, with just six of those outings coming as starts. ?    @Brahim D  azYour first Rossonero autograph, the most important ?

D  az, who has been handed the number 21 shirt, has already joined up with manager Stefano Pioli and the rest of the squad ahead of the new Serie A season, which will get underway on September 19. For 21-year-old D  az, this move will represent a much-needed chance to get his career back on track. He has played less than 600 minutes of competitive football since leaving City and will be relishing the chance to strut his stuff once more. He will certainly get that chance with Milan, who have made a conscious effort to add some more young players in the transfer market this summer. Belgian winger Alexis  Saelemaekers, who is also 21, has joined from Anderlecht alongside former Lyon right-back Pierre Kalulu, but the biggest deal of their summer will likely be the imminent acquisition of midfielder Sandro Tonali from Brescia. Milan managed to snatch sixth spot in the Serie A standings last season, earning themselves a place in the Europa League qualifying rounds, with Irish side Shamrock Rovers their first opponent.
