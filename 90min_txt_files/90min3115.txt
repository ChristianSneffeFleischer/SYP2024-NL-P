Brentford believe they will beat Manchester United to the signing of goalkeeper Thomas Strakosha, 90min understands. The Albania international has been searching for a new club after leaving Lazio at the end of his contract last month, bringing the curtain down on a 10-year stay in the Italian capital. 90min revealed last week that Brentford were on the hunt for an experienced goalkeeper, and it appears Strakosha is their man with the Bees believing they will win the race for his signature. The 27-year-old appeared to be heading to Manchester United last week after Dean Henderson's loan move to Nottingham Forest, while Fulham were also looking into a deal earlier this window. But Thomas Frank's side have stolen a march on their rivals and expect to land Strakosha.
