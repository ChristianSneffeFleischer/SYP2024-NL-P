Manchester City have told a number of clubs who have enquired about Nathan Ake that he is not for sale in January, 90min understands The 27-year-old Dutch defender almost re-joined former club Chelsea in the summer, but the deal collapsed after Pep Guardiola insisted that he wanted him as part of his squad.  Now, despite a plethora of options, including new signing Manuel Akanji, Ake has emerged as one of City's preferred options and he has rewarded Guardiola with a series of impressive displays. Italian giants Inter have been linked in recent weeks, and sources have confirmed to 90min that they are not the only club to ask about Ake. We understand that Juventus, Paris Saint-Germain and Bayern Munich are also among the clubs to enquire. But City have no intention of listening to offers for Ake, who himself in recent days has made it known that he is more than happy to stay with the club following the collapse of his summer switch back to Stamford Bridge. "In the end I'm happy to be here," said Ake. "Sometimes these things happen [transfer links and rumours] and in the end I'm very happy that I stayed. You have to learn, and I have learned a lot over the years. It   s interesting and I had to get used to it in the first season but now I know it.    My first season wasn't great anyway because of injuries - there was a lot of stop and start so it was difficult. In the second season, you get used to it, knowing the kind of squad we have, the manager uses all the players.
