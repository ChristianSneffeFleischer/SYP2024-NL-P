Paris Saint-Germain are interested in signing Chelsea midfielder Jorginho on loan, but they will face competition from Arsenal. The Italian has been a regular fixture in the Blues side since signing from Napoli back in 2018, making 100 appearances in all competitions and scoring ten goals. The midfielder was linked with a move to Juventus earlier this summer but Frank Lampard appears to remain keen on retaining the 28-year-old, giving him the captain's armband during the Blues' first two games of the season. This has not stopped him attracting interest from other clubs though, with PSG the latest name to be linked. According to Telefoot Chaine, the Ligue 1 champions are interested in taking the former Napoli man on loan for the season, with the two clubs said to have already made contact over a potential deal. Midfield has long been a problem area for PSG and Jorginho could be the addition that Thomas Tuchel needs in order to end his side's Champions League hoodoo. Since being taken over by Qatar Sports Investments in 2011, Les Rogues et Bleu have suffered several high profile failures on the European stage, most recently losing to Bayern Munich in the 2020 final.
