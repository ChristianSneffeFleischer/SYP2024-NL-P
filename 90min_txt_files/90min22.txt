Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has aimed a dig at Chelsea's transfer business amid the races to sign midfielders Moises Caicedo and Romeo Lavia.  Liverpool have been keen to add another midfielder to their ranks all summer having let Jordan Henderson, Fabinho, Naby Keita, James Milner and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain all the leave the club, and recently saw a  £111m bid accepted by Brighton and Hove Albion for the talented Caicedo.   However, Caicedo's preference to move to Stamford Bridge has invited Chelsea back into the race and 90min understands that Brighton have now accepted a British record  £115m bid from the Blues for the player, with Caicedo now set to put pen to paper on an eight-year deal at Chelsea.  Along with Caicedo, Liverpool have also faced stiff competition from Chelsea for their other primary midfield target Romeo Lavia. The Reds saw three bids rejected before Chelsea entered the race, initially bidding  £48m before offering  £55m. 90min reported on Sunday that Liverpool are now willing to match Chelsea's bid in the hope of signing Lavia from Southampton. feed When asked by Sky Sports about the ongoing transfer battles between Liverpool and Chelsea after the clubs' 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge, Klopp was keen to aim a thinly-veiled dig at the Blues for their spending. "Where   s the camera? No [I cannot say anything]. Oh, that [new signings] is what the Chelsea manager wants, and usually they get it! I   ve got nothing to say about it to be honest," he said. "I   m sorry." Once the Caicedo signing is confirmed, Chelsea will have spent over  £800m on new players since Todd Boehly took over ownership of the club. This summer alone, the Blues will have spent nearly  £300m on eight players for new manager Mauricio Pochettino.
