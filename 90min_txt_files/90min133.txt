Wolfsburg defender Micky van de Ven is set to undergo a medical with Tottenham ahead of a switch to the Premier League, 90min understands. New manager Ange Postecoglou has publicly called for a new defender to be signed this summer and Spurs have responded with a deal for Van de Ven, which could be worth up to    50m ( £43.5m) including add-ons. With the two teams now simply finalising the last details of a transfer, Van de Ven is heading to England to undergo a medical ahead of signing a long-term contract at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. The 22-year-old is set to become Spurs' fourth senior signing of the summer, following James Maddison, Guglielmo Vicario and Manor Solomon in joining the club. feed Despite the imminent deal for Van de Ven, 90min understands Spurs remain interested in Barcelona centre-back Clement Lenglet, who spent last season on loan at the club and has interest from across the globe. Al Nassr have made Lenglet an offer but the Frenchman would rather stay in Europe, where Napoli are also plotting a bid. Spurs also have plenty of potential outgoings to deal with. Atletico Madrid are interested in signing Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg while Davinson Sanchez and Tanguy Ndombele are both targets for Galatasaray. Harry Kane is the subject of a    100m ( £88.5m) bid from Bayern Munich, with Spurs battling to try and convince the striker to sign a new contract. Meanwhile, Spurs have finalised the signing of 18-year-old defender Ashley Phillips from Blackburn Rovers, with the teenager expected to head out on loan.
