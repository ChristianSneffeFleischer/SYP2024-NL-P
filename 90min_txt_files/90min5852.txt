Inter have rejected a    12m bid from Bayern Munich for Ivan Perisic, with the Nerazzurri holding firm with their    15m valuation. The Croatian enjoyed a fine individual campaign out on loan at the treble winners last term, scoring eight times and adding a further ten assists in 35 total appearances - all while sustaining an ankle break in training at the start of February. Perisic went on to start in Bayern's Champions League quarter-final and semi-final victories over Barcelona and Lyon respectively but was dropped for eventual match-winner Kingsley Coman in the final against Paris Saint-Germain. Nevertheless, Die Roten appear keen to retain the services of the 31-year-old on a permanent basis this summer and have submitted a    12m offer to Inter. However, Fabrizio Romano reports their initial proposal has been rejected by the Italian club, who are currently holding out for    15m. Nevertheless, with only a    3m difference between the two parties, it looks like there could be a compromise in sight if talks continue. The arrival of Antonio Conte at Inter last summer meant the Nerazzurri were content in letting Perisic - a star performer under Luciano Spalletti - depart to Bavaria. The 31-year-old simply isn't a great systematic fit for Conte's 3-5-2 and despite talk of Perisic perhaps serving as a fourth choice striker at San Siro next season, it seems to be in the best interests of the Nerazzurri to see the Croatian exit for Bavaria permanently ahead of the 2020/21 campaign.
