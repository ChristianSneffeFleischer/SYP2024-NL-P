Former Chelsea boss Maurizio Sarri is interested in reuniting with a number of Blues players at Lazio in the January transfer window. Sarri was Chelsea manager for the 2018/19 season, winning the Europa League against London rivals Arsenal in the final to end his own personal trophy duck. He left the club after just one campaign in charge at Stamford Bridge to join Juventus and was replaced by Chelsea legend Frank Lampard. While Sarri's era at the club feels a world away now, Italian source Il Massaggero report that he is keen on signing several players who featured under him in west London.
