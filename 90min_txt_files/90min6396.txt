Wolverhampton Wanderers' Adama Traor   has garnered the attention of several European giants this season, as Manchester City and Juventus join the race for his signature.  Traor   joined Wolves after two inconsistent years at Middlesbrough in the summer of 2018, for around  Â£18m. This season the 24-year-old has blossomed into one of the Premier League's most exciting - and deadly - talents with four goals and nine assists in the competition.

In January, a 90min exclusive revealed that three clubs had registered an interest in the dynamic winger, with his former side Barcelona rivalling the Premier League's Manchester City and Liverpool.  However, ESPN's sources suggest that Juventus have joined the hunt for Traor  's services. The Italian giants and Manchester City supposedly top the list of suitors while Barcelona have dropped out of contention. The Catalan club are thought to only be able to finance a move for Traor   next summer.  Adama Traore is going places.

The Midlands team are sixth in the Premier League table and a flying start to football's resumption - thanks in no small part to Traor  's ever-increasing influence - leaves them very much in the race for the top four places.
