Chelsea are in talks to sign out-of-favour Paris Saint-Germain left-back Layvin Kurzawa, as their search for cover for the injured Ben Chilwell continues. Chilwell underwent successful knee surgery in late December after damaging his ACL and is now expected to miss the rest of the season, which leaves Marcos Alonso as the only recognised left-back in the squad. Chelsea are searching for alternatives in the January transfer window. They failed with a proposed loan move for France international Lucas Digne, who Everton preferred to sell and has since joined Aston Villa, and were unsuccessful in their attempts to bring Emerson Palmieri back from his spell with Lyon early.  Although Brazilian wide man Kenedy has been recalled from his own loan at Flamengo, it seems head coach Thomas Tuchel is still looking at other options. According to RMC, Chelsea have opened talks with PSG over another Frenchman in Kurzawa. Despite only signing a four-year contract extension in 2020, Kurzawa has not played since August, finding himself way down the pecking order under Mauricio Pochettino. He is unsurprisingly looking for a way out of the Parc des Princes. Kurzawa worked with Tuchel during their time together in the French capital and although he was not always first choice, the German coach was insistent on keeping him when he flirted with a move to Arsenal in 2020, eventually convincing him to pen fresh terms.
