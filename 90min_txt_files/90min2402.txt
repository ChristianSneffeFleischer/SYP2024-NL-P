Roma striker Tammy Abraham has refused to rule out a return to boyhood club Chelsea. The 25-year-old left Stamford Bridge in 2021 after losing his place under Thomas Tuchel and enjoyed an outstanding debut season in Rome, racking up 27 goals and six assists in 53 games in all competitions. As part of the  £34m deal which took Abraham to Roma, Chelsea are understood to have negotiated a buy-back clause which sits around the    80m ( £70.3m) mark. Asked whether he would be interested in a return to Chelsea if they triggered the clause, Abraham told Ojora Babatunde: "My focus is to do exactly what I did last year here. "I'm happy here, the team is good, the manager's good, the city, the fans... I'm happy. But you never know the future. Only God knows the future." Abraham is still finding his place with Roma this season after manager Jose Mourinho re-jigged his attacking lineup to incorporate new signing Paulo Dybala, managing just two goals in his first ten games of the campaign. Whether Chelsea will trigger their buy-back clause remains to be seen, but what is clear is the Blues' desire to remodel their attack over the coming months.
