Arsenal have submitted an opening offer for Brentford goalkeeper David Raya, 90min understands. Brentford have made it clear all summer that they are prepared to sell Raya, who is in the final year of his contract, for  £40m - an asking price which scared off Tottenham before they signed Guglielmo Vicario instead. After expressing an interest in Raya earlier this week, Arsenal have now opened the bidding with an offer which 90min understands is closer to half of Brentford's asking price. An initial  £20m has been proposed, with Arsenal also prepared to pay up to  £5m in potential add-ons. Brentford are expected to reject the offer as they stand firm on their asking price. Manager Thomas Frank recently insisted  £40m is cheap for Raya, pointing to Arsenal's decision to sign another player in the final year of their contract, Declan Rice, for  £105m. feed Arsenal are not alone in their pursuit of Raya, with German giants Bayern Munich also keen on the Spaniard as they seek to replace Yann Sommer, who is expected to join Inter. Sommer has acted as cover for the injured Manuel Neuer after the German broke his leg following the conclusion of the World Cup but is expected to leave this summer and Bayern are keen to move for Raya, although Brentford's asking price continues to prove problematic. Raya himself confessed earlier this summer that he feared Brentford's  £40m demand would price him out of a transfer, although the 27-year-old vowed to respect his club's decision and remain focused on the job if he is not granted an exit. As for Brentford, they have already signed a replacement for Raya, striking a deal to recruit Dutch international Mark Flekken from Freiburg last month.
