Manchester United were among the clubs watching Porto winger Luis Diaz in action in the Primeira Liga against Famalicao over the weekend. Diaz had generally flown under the radar since arriving in Portugal from his native Colombia in 2019 with only modest goal returns. But the 25-year-old is having a breakout season so far in 2021/22, netting 14 times in 18 leagues appearances to better his tally from the last two years combined. Liverpool are one of the sides that have already been linked with Diaz this month, with O Jogo now reporting that United and Atletico Madrid had a scouting presence at Porto   s weekend fixture. Borussia Dortmund were also in attendance at the Estadio do Dragao. Diaz has a contract at Porto until 2024 and a release clause is rumoured to be in the region of    70m or    80m. However, other reports have indicated that could drop significantly in the summer when he will enter the final two years of his deal with the Portuguese giants. United have consistently bought from the Portuguese market over the years, stretching back to their capture of a teenage Cristiano Ronaldo from Sporting CP in 2003. Nani also arrived from Sporting in 2007, as did Marcos Rojo in 2014 and Bruno Fernandes just two years ago. United have also landed Victor Lindelof from Benfica, as well as the much less successful capture of Bebe from Vitoria Guimaraes in 2010. They have specifically done business with Porto in the past to sign Anderson in 2007 and Diogo Dalot in 2018.
