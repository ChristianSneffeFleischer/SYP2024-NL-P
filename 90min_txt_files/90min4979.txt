Sergio Romero has said farewell to members of the Manchester United staff ahead of a potential move in January. The Argentinian has slipped further down the pecking order at Old Trafford following Dean Henderson's return from his loan spell at Sheffield United, and with Lee Grant also in the picture Romero now appears to be United's fourth choice goalkeeper. He has not featured for the Red Devils since their Europa League quarter final victory over Copenhagen on 10 August, and was left out of their Premier League and Champions League squads for the 2020/21 campaign. According to the Manchester Evening News, Romero said goodbye to a selection of staff members at United's Carrington training complex in December, and has not returned to training since the turn of the year. The 33-year-old is reportedly back in his native Argentina and training in Buenos Aires, with a move to Boca Juniors in the pipeline.  Romero has United's permission to train in Argentina, but should a transfer move fail to materialise, he will be expected to return to Manchester. Romero was widely regarded as one of the best backup goalkeepers in the Premier League during his five years at Old Trafford, and his treatment over the past six months is said to have disappointed other members of the United squad.
