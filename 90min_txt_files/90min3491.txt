CIES Football Observatory has calculated how much clubs around the world have made by selling home-grown players developed in their youth ranks in recent years. Youth academies can often be the lifeblood of a club, producing players they then sell for a handsome transfer fee to reinvest back in their squad. But even the biggest teams can still make considerable money simply from investing time in developing young talents. For a player to be considered 'home-grown', they must have spent at least three years at a club between their 15th and 21st birthdays. The fees include all add-ons and the list covers every transfer registered since the start of the 2015 summer transfer window.
