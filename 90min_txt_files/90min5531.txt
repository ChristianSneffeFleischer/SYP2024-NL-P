Manchester United are interested in securing a deal for Atalanta prospect Amad Traore before transfer deadline day.  The 18-year-old winger is yet to fully break into the first-team set up in Bergamo, experiencing just 24 minutes of Serie A action during his career to date.  However, he did become the youngest player to score on their Italian top flight debut last season, when he added his side's final goal in a 7-1 thrashing of Udinese.  According to the Manchester Evening News, United are interested in bringing Traore to Old Trafford before the transfer window slams shut on 5 October. It is reported that talks of progressing well  and there is 'cautious optimism' that a deal could be completed soon. Saying that, sources in Italy suggest Traore could cost a considerable fee. Atalanta are also known to be tough negotiators, particularly when English clubs come sniffing around their players. One of the reasons United are keen to get the deal completed during the current window is that player registration rules are set to change soon due to Brexit. For the time being, the UK is still following European Union regulations as part of a transition period until 31 January.  Under these stipulations, Premier League clubs are able to sign any young player who possesses an EU passport - which the Ivorian born Traore does as he moved to Italy at a young age.
