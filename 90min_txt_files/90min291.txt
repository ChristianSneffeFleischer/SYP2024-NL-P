Chelsea have confirmed Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has left the club and signed for Marseille. The 34-year-old only joined the Blues at the end of the summer 2022 transfer window, reuniting with former Borussia Dortmund manager Thomas Tuchel. However, the German was sacked just days after Aubameyang's arrival. Aubameyang endured a largely unsuccessful campaign which culminated in an anonymous performance away at former club Arsenal, with Chelsea falling to a limp 3-1 defeat. Though he had offers to join clubs in the Saudi Pro League, Aubameyang has opted to remain in Europe and has joined Marseille on a free transfer. feed A statement from Chelsea read: "Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has left Chelsea and joined Ligue 1 side Marseille. "The Gabon international arrived at Stamford Bridge last summer from Barcelona and went on to make 21 appearances in all competitions for the Blues. "He scored three goals for Chelsea, all of which came in the space of ten days in October. Aubameyang struck against Crystal Palace in the Premier League and converted in back-to-back Champions League group stage matches against AC Milan. "We would like to thank Pierre and wish him well as he begins the next chapter of his career."
