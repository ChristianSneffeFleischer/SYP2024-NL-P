Carlo Ancelotti has insisted Everton won't stand in the way of Moise Kean should he wish to make his temporary move to Paris Saint-Germain permanent. The Italy international has been on loan at Parc des Princes since signing a season-long deal with PSG in October, and despite some stellar competition for places he seems to have made himself at home in the French capital. Kean has started all but one of the club's 12 Ligue 1 fixtures this season, notching eight goals in the process.  The 20-year-old has already impressed new boss Mauricio Pochettino - netting PSG's first goal of the former Tottenham boss' tenure -  and Ancelotti insists that Everton are open to the idea of making the move permanent if all parties involved are in agreement.    First we have to look at the desire of the player,    he said, as reported by The Guardian.    If the player wants to stay at PSG then of course the two clubs have to sit at the table to talk about this, and we are open to talk.  "The club is open to talk if PSG wants to sign Moise Kean, who is doing really well in this moment.    Another player whose future at Everton has been called into question of late is Bernard. The midfielder has failed to cement his place in the Toffees starting XI since his arrival at the club in 2018 and has started just two Premier League games this season.
