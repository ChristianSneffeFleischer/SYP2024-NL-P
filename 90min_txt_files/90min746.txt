Arsenal have agreed a deal worth in excess of  £65m to sign Germany international Kai Havertz from Chelsea, 90min understands. 90min recently reported that the Gunners had entered talks with the Blues over a potential move for Havertz, with Chelsea keen to strike a deal worth over  £70m in order to recoup the fee they initially shelled out to Bayer Leverkusen in 2020. Sources have confirmed that Arsenal have, however, been successful in negotiating a lower fee despite Chelsea's initial adamancy that they would not accept less than  £70m. 90min understands that a deal worth over  £65m overall has been accepted by the Blues. Havertz is set to become one of the highest paid players at the Emirates Stadium, alongside Bukayo Saka, once the deal is finalised. feed Havertz had previously been of interest to Bayern Munich and Real Madrid in recent weeks, with the former recently initiating talks with the forward's representatives. Real Madrid backed away from any potential deal in early June due to concerns over Chelsea's asking price for the German. The forward will join the Gunners following a rather inconsistent three-year stint at Stamford Bridge. Havertz scored 19 goals in the Premier League for Chelsea, but he will be most fondly remembered for his UEFA Champions League-winning goal against Manchester City in the 2021 final.
