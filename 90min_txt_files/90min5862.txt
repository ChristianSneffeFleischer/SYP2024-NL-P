Real Madrid and Arsenal are edging closer to an agreement that would see midfielder Dani Ceballos return to the Emirates for a second season on loan. The Spanish international spent the 2019/20 season on loan with the Gunners, and played an integral part in Mikel Arteta's side's FA Cup triumph. Ceballos popped up with a crucial goal to see Arsenal past Sheffield United in the quarter finals, before playing the full 90 as Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang inspired the Gunners to a 2-1 victory over Chelsea in the final. According to Spanish journalist Jose Luis Sanchez, the two clubs are in advanced talks and are closing in on an agreement which would see the midfielder return to Arsenal for another full season. Italian journalist Fabrizio Romano adds that the Gunners have had three bids turned down for Ceballos thus far, but Real are expected to give the deal the go-ahead promptly. The 24-year-old blossomed in north London after the December appointment of Mikel Arteta, and the Gunners boss made no secret of his desire to retain Ceballos ahead of his first full season in charge. Arteta told Arsenal's official club website: "Well, we have some talks and Dani knows really well what I think about him. He was pretty clear with me as well that his intention was to remain with us but obviously Real Madrid is involved and I don   t know yet what they want to do with the player."
