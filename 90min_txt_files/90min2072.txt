Rafael Leao has spoken about his future at AC Milan as transfer rumours continue to swirl around the Portuguese's future at the club. The 23-year-old forward has blossomed over the last couple of years into one of the star players at San Siro, scoring 14 goals last season and forcing his way into the Portugal setup. Leao was part of the Portugal side that reached the World Cup quarter-finals, scoring twice in the process including a stunning strike against Switzerland in the Round of 16. Chelsea have made Leao a top target and 90min understands that the Blues were boosted when he recently turned down early offers of a new Milan contract. But even so, the player has insisted he remains happy for now and isn't pushing a move, although different experiences still remain his ambition at some point in the future. In an interview with Des Cons Truir in his home country, Leao said:    Experience in a new league? Yes, in the future - but now I   m 100% focused on AC Milan. It   s a top club and I   m under contract there. I like the city too.    Leao also commented on the teams he has enjoyed watching this season, and singled out Chelsea's Premier League rivals Arsenal for praise.    I watch many games. This year, I like Arsenal - they   re playing very well," he said.
