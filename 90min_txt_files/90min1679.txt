Leeds United have announced the loan signing of Weston McKennie from Juventus on an initial loan deal. The Whites have been looking to add depth and quality to their midfield this month, with Morocco World Cup star Azzedine Ounahi their initial priority. But when it appeared they would not be able to agree a deal with Angers, they moved on to McKennie, whose signing was confirmed on Monday evening. A statement from Leeds read: "Leeds United are delighted to announce the signing of Weston McKennie on loan until the end of the 2022/23 season, subject to a work permit. "The 24-year-old midfielder joins the Whites from Italian Serie A side Juventus, with a view to a permanent deal at the end of the season." McKennie, who was a star of the USMNT's run to the World Cup last 16 this winter, has been handed the number 28 shirt at Elland Road. He could make his Leeds debut in a trip to Nottingham Forest in the Premier League on Sunday afternoon.
