Bayern Munich have stepped up their interest in Football Manager wonderkid Eduardo Camavinga, according to reports in Germany.  The 18-year-old burst onto the scene at Rennes in 2019, making 36 appearances in all competitions last season. He has continued to catch the eye this campaign with his dynamic performances in defensive midfield. He was rewarded with his first France cap in September and marked the occasion by scoring a fine bicycle kick.  Interest in Camavinga is high with 90min revealing back in October that he is a priority target for Real Madrid, along with Kylian Mbappe and Paul Pogba. Real, Juventus, Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester United are all said to be interested. According to France Football (via Sport.de), Bayern are also in the race. It is understood that Die Roten have been impressed by the midfielder's maturity despite his young age and have earmarked him as Javi Martinez's successor, who is departing Bavaria at the end of the season.   The Camavinga transfer saga has had several twists recently and this is likely to continue over the coming months. First, it seemed that he would extend his current deal - which expires in June 2022 - by an additional year, only for talks to breakdown. Soon after, Camavinga dismissed his agent and signed with Jonathan Barnett's Stellar Group, who also represent Gareth Bale, Mason Mount and Ben Chilwell.
