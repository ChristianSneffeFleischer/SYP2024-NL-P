Defender Mauricio Cuevas is headed home to the LA Galaxy.  The US youth international formally signed before the league   s Primary Transfer Window closed Monday night, and is under contract through the end of the 2025 MLS season with two club option years through 2027. Cuevas, who left the LA Galaxy II in January 2022, found himself a valuable addition for Brugge   s Belgian second division development squad, Club NXT, racking up two assists in 23 matches and earning praise for his natural ability as a fullback. Welcoming him back into the fold, Head Coach and Sporting Director Greg Vanney commented on Cuevas    return,    We have always appreciated Mauricio   s talent and his passion for the club. He   s a versatile fullback that will contribute to the team while continuing to develop as a player."
