Manchester United have no interest in parting ways with Marcus Rashford this summer, 90min understands. The England forward entered this summer on the fringes of the United setup but, as 90min revealed  in June, his sights were set firmly on regaining his place at Old Trafford and he was looking forward to working under Ten Hag and Steve McClaren, both of whom are known to be fans of his. The managerial duo have spoken with Rashford about his role in the team and his future at United, and the 24-year-old is happy working under Ten Hag and McClaren. Rashford has less than a year remaining on his contract - although United do have an option to extend by 12 months - and 90min understands that intermediaries representing Paris Saint-Germain, who have shown interest before, have enquired about his availability - though there's been no official contact from the club. But sources have confirmed to 90min that allowing Rashford to leave is 'the last thing' United are considering this summer and the player himself is not pushing to leave Old Trafford. PSG boss Christophe Galtier, appointed this summer to replace former United managerial target Mauricio Pochettino, has confirmed his desire to sign a new forward, despite adding Hugo Ekitike to his ranks on a season-long loan deal from Reims. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  &  Sean Walsh  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Man Utd's transfer market implosion in targeting deals for Adrien Rabiot & Marko Arnautovic, Man City's stance on selling Bernardo Silva to Barcelona, Wilfried Zaha's future and more.
