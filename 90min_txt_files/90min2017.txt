Jurgen Klopp has listed reasons why Liverpool moved to sign Cody Gakpo this winter, insisting it was not simply to bulk up squad numbers. Manchester United were long expected to secure Gakpo's signature after a summer move broke down, only for Liverpool to swoop in and complete a deal for the Dutchman. With winger Luis Diaz suffering an injury setback, it was speculated that the Reds' quick move to sign Gakpo from PSV was in part due to their shortage of options in attack. Speaking ahead of Liverpool's 2-1 win against Leicester on Friday night, Klopp admitted that bringing Gakpo in now is opportune because of Diaz's injury, but it was not the only reason. "Yeah for sure [the transfer was brought forward because of injuries] but we   ve been interested in Cody for a long time, for a while," Klopp told Sky Sports. "You know our situation, we can   t pick players up on top, on top and stuff like this. We have to collect money then spend a little bit then we collect again.
