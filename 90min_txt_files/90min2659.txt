Callum Hudson-Odoi is set for a move to Germany after opting to join Bayer Leverkusen on loan, sources have told 90min. The England winger has been given permission to seek a move, after Thomas Tuchel informed him that he was happy for him to leave. Hudson-Odoi is one of a number of Chelsea forwards who Tuchel has decided do not currently form a part of his plans, and the club's hierarchy have decided to sanction a temporary move. The 22-year-old has two-years left on his current deal, and the size of his contract has meant a permanent deal would be difficult at this stage. A host of clubs from the Premier League and abroad have contacted with Chelsea about a deal, but the Blues have left the ultimate decision to the player and he has opted to finally move to Germany. Back in 2019, Bayern Munich made a number of bids to land Hudson-Odoi and the player even put in a transfer request. But he was persuaded to stay by then boss Frank Lampard and eventually signed a new long-term highly lucrative contract. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey,  Toby Cudworth  and  Harry Symeou  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Antony attempting to push through a move to Man Utd, Frenkie de Jong and Pierre-Emerick Aubayemang's futures at Barcelona and Arsenal's interest in Pedro Neto.
