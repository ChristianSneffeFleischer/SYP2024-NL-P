Barcelona have submitted a new bid to Manchester City for centre-back Eric Garc  a, but there are conflicting reports over the value of this latest transfer offer. The 19-year-old has been identified as Barcelona's top defensive target for the summer window, but the Catalan side are reluctant to pay too much as Garc  a has just one year remaining on his contract and has already made it clear he does not intend to extend his stay. Barcelona are hopeful that City will agree to sell now before he leaves for free, and according to the Daily Mail, they have offered to pay  £13.6m to take the defender off their hands before Monday's deadline. There is no mention of whether this bid has been accepted or rejected, but if we head over to Spain, Marca believe that Barcelona's chances of landing Garc  a are slim to none. The two reports differ over the value of Bar  a's latest bid. Marca seem almost perplexed by the situation, noting that this offer is actually lower than the first one which Barcelona submitted earlier this summer. Back then, Bar  a offered    8m up-front with a further    2m in add-ons to take the total value to    10m ( £9m), but after that was rejected, the Spanish side have returned with a lower offer... for some reason. This second bid was just    5m up-front, and the add-ons didn't even take the value past the    10m mark. Believe it or not, City weren't exactly satisfied with that. Pep Guardiola is looking for closer to  £27m to part ways with Garc  a this summer, so the belief is that this deal is not going to happen. Bar  a are prepared to wait a year and bag the defender on a free. City are still hopeful of convincing Garc  a to stay at the Etihad, although the fact that he has not made three of City's five matchday squads so far this season probably isn't going to help their cause.
