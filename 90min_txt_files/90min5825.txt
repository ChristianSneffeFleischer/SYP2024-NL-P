Leicester City are eyeing a potential move for Torino defender Nicolas Nkoulou, as the club look to bolster their defensive options ahead of the upcoming season.  Having looked certainties for Champions League football last campaign, the Foxes endured an end-of-season collapse and ultimately missed out on a top-four spot on the final day at the hands of Manchester United. Centre-back   a  lar S  y  nc     s suspension undoubtedly played a part in the club   s poor form late on     after he was sent off at Bournemouth with just three games of the season remaining -   as veteran Wes Morgan and Wolves loanee Ryan Bennett were tasked with filling in for the Turnkey international. With Brendan Rodgers keen to avoid similar squad-depth problems this season, Tuttosport claim the Foxes have identified centre-back Nkoulou as one of their summer targets.  The 30-year-old has been a mainstay in the Torino backline since joining from French side Lyon in 2017, however, he has just one year remaining on his current contract at the Serie A outfit - with a new deal yet to be agreed . Nkoulou would bring with him a wealth of experience having represented Cameroon 75 times, as well as making over 400 appearances in both France and Italy. The former Marseille man was named in the Ligue 1 Team of the Year in both 2012 and 2013 and lifted the Coupe de la Ligue during his time with Les Olympiens.
