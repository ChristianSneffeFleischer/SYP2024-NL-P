Wilfried Zaha is continuing to weigh up his options ahead of the expiry of his Crystal Palace contract, and is tempted by a move to Marseille, 90min understands. The Ivorian forward has established himself as one of the Premier League's finest wingers in recent years, often proving to be the Eagles' talisman in the prime of his career. Now 30 years of age, Zaha is considering a future away from Selhurst Park. Sources have told 90min Zaha dreams of strutting his stuff on the UEFA Champions League stage, and his representatives have been in talks with Marseille over a free transfer to the south of France. feed Marseille currently sit second in the Ligue 1 table, with the top three qualifying for next season's Champions League, though third place have to enter the play-off qualifying round. OM sit eight points behind leaders PSG, one point clear of Lens in third and six ahead of Monaco in fourth with only six games to play. Zaha is open to a move to Marseille, particularly as the once widespread interest from England's top clubs has dried up - he remains on a lot of teams' shortlists, but is no longer a first-choice target for any of them. Crystal Palace are still trying to tie Zaha down to a lucrative new contract in south London, and returning manager Roy Hodgson recently spoke about the winger's future. "With my interest in the club and my admiration for Wilf, I would like him to stay," he said. "I would hope, from the club's point of view, that he accepts the offer on the table and decides his future lies here." 90min reported last month that Zaha has also received a huge contract offer from Saudi Pro League side Al Ittihad.
