Miguel Almiron's agent Daniel Campos has hinted that his client could soon be headed for the exit door at Newcastle United. Almiron arrived at St. James' Park from Atlanta United in a  Â£21m deal in January 2019 and has since gone on to make 62 appearances for the Magpies, notching nine goals and five assists in all competitions.  However, Campos has dropped a bombshell regarding the Paraguay international's future, with the midfielder struggling for game time this season. Speaking to a Paraguayan radio station (via the Newcastle Chronicle), Almiron's agent claimed the Newcastle midfielder would've already departed the north east had it not been for the coronavirus pandemic.  "There in England, they say he   s a 'Premier League-style' player. I think that if it wasn   t for the pandemic, he would   ve been playing in a different team. But oh well, what happened happened. "He has to continue being on a team where the aspirations are different, we know that there is a league with six strong teams and the others are fighting for the remaining spots. And in that part, Newcastle is there," Campos added. "But, he   s happy. People love him and on the national team, he can play an extra function like we saw the other day [in Paraguay's 1-1 draw against Argentina] where he had to show a bit of his defensive work." Despite claiming that his client is happy at St. James' Park, Campos also states that he has 'no doubt' that Almiron will leave Newcastle in the near future - with Atletico Madrid a potential suitor. "I have no doubt he will leave, I think it will happen soon, perhaps in June [2021] because this year, everything was disorganized on the transfers due to the COVID-19 pandemic," the agent adds.
