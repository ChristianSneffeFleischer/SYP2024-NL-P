Jadon Sancho remains Manchester United's number one priority for the remainder of the transfer window, despite reports on Tuesday evening that Borussia Dortmund have rejected their opening offer for the player. Various sources, Sky in Germany the first, had suggested that United had seen a bid of    80m plus an additional    20m turned down for the England international. However, an official bid has not yet been lodged by United - even while they have informed Dortmund that they would be willing to pay    100m to get the deal done.  If we're all on the same team, we'll never be defeated. #YouCantStopUs #TeamNike @nike A post shared by  Jadon Sancho (@sanchooo10) on Jul 30, 2020 at 8:13am PDT 90min understands that belief remains on all sides that a deal will be struck in the final week. Talks are continuing to find an agreement. Sancho is keen on the move to Manchester, and has made it clear to Dortmund in recent weeks that he would join United were a bid to be accepted. He has again made his position clear to the German club in the last 48 hours, and has already agreed personal terms. Agent fees have also been thrashed out. The news from elsewhere of a failed first bid for Sancho was almost immediately followed up on Tuesday night by fresh reports from Spain stating United were close to signing Barcelona's Ousmane Dembele instead.  There is little substance behind the Dembele speculation, however. He has been on a list of alternative targets but suggestions they will move to sign the Frenchman on a permanent deal, especially with several days remaining in the window, are wide of the mark as it stands. Ismaila Sarr and Douglas Costa are other potential options that could be explored later down the line.
