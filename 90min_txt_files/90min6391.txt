Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta has hinted at the possible permanent signing of on-loan midfielder Dani Ceballos, suggesting negotiations with Real Madrid could already be ongoing. Ceballos had a difficult start to his season-long loan from Los Blancos, suffering a muscle injury that ruled him out in November and didn   t see him start another game until February. But more recently under Arteta, the Spaniard has begun to thrive. He was impressive again in Arsenal   s 1-1 draw with Leicester on Tuesday night, earning personal praise from his manager after the game.    He was superb again,    the Gunners boss said in his video press conference, via Arsenal.com.    I think him and Granit have created a really good understanding. They give us a lot of balance and a lot of stability with the ball to make the right decision in moments of transition and they are evolving a lot together. Defensively, Dani has made a big step forward with the way he is pressing, the amount of interceptions that he is putting in and he is enjoying it.    I am really happy with him,    Arteta added when pressed on the subject of a permanent deal.    I think it is something that the club has to go a little bit further with Real Madrid on. At the moment he is playing very well, I am really happy with him and he is a big talent and still has a lot of things to improve.    Fresh from committing his long-term future to Arsenal last week with a new contract, teenage starlet Bukayo Saka was also impressive against the Foxes. Having filled in as a makeshift left-back from December to March, the 18-year-old has operated in more natural attacking positions since the season restarted. He scored against Wolves at the weekend and provided the assist for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang against Leicester.
