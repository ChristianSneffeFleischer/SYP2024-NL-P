Barcelona are confident of securing what they expect will be a world record transfer for Manchester City and England midfielder Keira Walsh, 90min understands. Sources have suggested to 90min that an agreement with Walsh and her representatives over personal terms has already been reached in principle. Spain   s transfer deadline falls on Wednesday, which means a deal has to be completed quickly. 90min has been informed that, privately, the player would like to make the switch to Bar  a, although she refused to address the subject in public when asked about her future in a pre-match press conference ahead of England   s final World Cup qualifier against Luxembourg this week.    My focus is on England right now, so I   m not really here to talk about what is going on club wise to be honest,    she said with a wry smile on her face. 90min can also confirm that if successful Bar  a will break the women   s transfer world record - first reported by Sky Sports - set in 2020 when Chelsea paid an estimated  Â£250,000 for Pernille Harder. Having made her senior club debut at 17, Walsh established herself as a key player for Manchester City as a 20-year-old in 2017 and has become increasingly important for England in recent years, culminating in Euro 2022 glory this summer and a place in team of the tournament. Now 25, she is widely recognised as one of the best central midfielders in the world and Barcelona have been keen to add her to their ranks as they seek to strengthen and reclaim their crown in the Champions League after losing last season   s final to Lyon. The Catalans will be without captain Alexia Putellas for the majority of this season and have also lost striker Jenni Hermoso to Pachuca in Mexico.
