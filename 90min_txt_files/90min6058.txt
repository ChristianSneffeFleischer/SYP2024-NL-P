Liverpool have no intention of making an approach for highly-rated Vasco da Gama youngster Talles Magno, despite months of speculation linking him with a move to Anfield. With J  rgen  Klopp seemingly keen to bring attacking reinforcements to the club, the Reds have been continually linked with the young forward in recent months.  Recent reports in Brazil had suggested that the frontman was closing in on a move to Merseyside, however, Standard Sport claim that Liverpool have no interest in signing the Brazilian. Having burst onto the scene at the Under-17 World Cup, Magno has attracted plaudits from around the world, with many dubbing him    the next Neymar   . Despite his impressive performances for the youth side, Magno has yet to earn a senior call-up to the Brazil squad, something which may well be a factor in the Reds' decision not to pursue the youngster - given that he would struggle to obtain a work permit to play in the Premier League. Liverpool suffered similar issues when signing Allan Rodrigues de Souza back in 2015. With their original request for a permit denied, the midfielder had loans spells in Finland and then Belgium in the hope that this would aid their application. However, with a permit denied the youngster was shipped out for further temporary spells in Germany, Cyprus and Brazil, before the club eventually admitted defeat and the 23-year-old was sold to Atletico Mineiro. With Klopp set to turn his attentions elsewhere, it remains to be seen who the German tactician will target as a deputy for Roberto Firmino.
