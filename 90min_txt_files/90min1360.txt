Barcelona are looking to sell right-back Sergino Dest, who is attracting interest from clubs in the Premier League, Bundesliga and Ligue 1, as well as elsewhere in La Liga, 90min understands. Bar  a had enough faith in Dest   s potential that they were willing to pay an initial    21m plus up to    5m in add-ons for the Dutch-born United States international after only 38 senior games for Ajax. But after just two seasons at Camp Nou, the Catalan hierarchy sent him on loan to AC Milan for the duration of the current campaign. That deal includes an option for the Rossoneri to make it permanent for    20m, but it isn   t set to be triggered after only two Serie A starts. Even before a build up of recent injury and fitness problems that means he hasn   t played since January, the 22-year-old had largely been a back-up player coming off the bench. But given his age and continued long-term potential, there is no shortage of suitors all considering whether an approach and a fresh start could reignite his career. manual 90min understands that Atletico Madrid, Villarreal, Valencia and Sevilla are all keen on keeping Dest in Spain, with competition overseas from Lyon and Bundesliga title challengers Union Berlin. From the Premier League, West Ham, Crystal Palace and Wolves are also keeping tabs on things. Barcelona have high expectations when it comes to price, seeking to recoup as much of their original    21m investment as possible with a permanent sale. Dest has a contract with the club until 2025 with a buyout clause of    400m.
