Barcelona winger Ferran Torres is not currently interested in a summer move to Aston Villa, sources have told 90min. Villa are looking to bolster their squad ahead of their return to European footballing having qualified for next season's Conference League. They are on the verge of completing a deal for centre-back Pau Torres, who worked under Unai Emery at Villarreal and was part of their Europa League-winning side of 2021. 90min reported earlier this week that Villa are set to miss out on Nico Williams, however, as he will sign a new contract at Athletic Club. They have since switched their attentions to former Manchester City wide-man Torres, with Bar  a open to a sale. 90min understands that Villa's talks with Barcelona have been productive and have progressed throughout the week, but the major stumbling block is Torres' reluctance to head to the West Midlands. Ansu Fati has similarly been linked with a move to England but is also resisting a transfer away from Catalonia. Reports in Spain suggest Barcelona are frustrated with the duo's unwillingness to leave. feed Speaking to Spanish media this week, Torres insisted he was focusing on his holidays ahead of returning to Bar  a for pre-season. "Today, I am at Bar  a, but football takes many turns. I have the phone on airplane mode, on July 10 [the start of pre-season], I will open it," he said. "I'm just focused on what's mine, training, taking advantage of the pre-season that I couldn't do last year [due to injury] and from here on, showing that I'm a great footballer. In the next few days you will have news." Torres has failed to nail down a starting spot at Barcelona since signing from Manchester City back in January 2022. In 71 games for La Blaugrana, he's scored 14 goals and registered nine assists.
