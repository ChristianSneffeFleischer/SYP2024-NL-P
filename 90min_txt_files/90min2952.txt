Ajax manager Alfred Schreuder has insisted he does not believe Antony is looking to leave the club this summer. 90min understands that the Brazil international remains at the top of Erik ten Hag's list of attacking targets at Manchester United, although the Red Devils' informal proposal of just under  Â£60m is not enough to convince Ajax to sell. Asked whether he is scared to lose Antony this summer, Schreuder told Ziggo Sport that Ajax do not believe they will need to sell the winger.    No, I am not afraid of anything," he said. "We know we have very good players [here] and we assume we will keep the squad together. "But I know, and everyone knows, that in football you never know." Schreuder reiterated that determination in another interview with De Telegraaf, adding that Antony does not seem like a player interested in a transfer. "Internally we have agreed that we want to keep the current squad together. Nobody wants to sell him," the new boss said. "Antony is working well. I don't have the feeling that he's busy with a transfer." Listen now to 90min's Talking Transfers podcast, with  Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey,  Harry Symeou  &  Toby Cudworth.
