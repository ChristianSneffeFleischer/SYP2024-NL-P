West Ham United have agreed personal terms with Sassuolo striker Gianluca Scamacca ahead of a  £36m transfer, with the player now set to travel to London for a medical, 90min understands. The powerful Italy striker has emerged as West Ham's number one striking target after a move for Chelsea's Armando Broja stalled, despite the Albanian showing a strong interest in moving to London Stadium on a permanent basis. Scamacca scored 16 goals in 36 Serie A appearances last season, the sixth best in the division, and 90min revealed last Friday that the finishing touches were being put on a deal that will be worth around  £36m to Sassuolo - with  £30.5m of that figure guaranteed. 90min now understands that personal terms have been agreed with Scamacca, and it's expected that he'll sign a five-year contract at West Ham pending the successful completion of a medical.
