New PSG manager Christophe Galtier has admitted he hopes Neymar remains at Parc des Princes beyond this summer. The Brazil icon has been tipped to leave the club this month and intermediaries have offered his services around Europe, with Manchester United, Manchester City, Chelsea and Newcastle United all contacted in England. Bayern Munich, Juventus and AC Milan have also been offered the chance to sign Neymar but, as yet, none have taken up the opportunity. 90min understands that PSG are not convinced by the idea of selling Neymar this summer, although they have not ruled it out and would be interested to listen to offers. During his unveiling, Galtier was asked what his vision is for Neymar in the squad, and he made no secret of his desire to keep the 30-year-old around. "What coach wouldn't like to have Neymar in his squad?" Galtier said. "He's a world class player. "Sure, you need balance, but I have a very clear idea of how I want to use him. I hope that he will stay with us." Galtier also admitted his excitement towards working with Kylian Mbappe, who signed a new contract with PSG earlier this month, but insisted any success the club enjoys will be a team effort, rather than due to any superstar forwards. "As a French coach, I was very happy that Kylian stayed," Galtier said. "He is one of the best players in the world. "I know what he expects from his team. We know his strengths and the importance he has. If these great individuals are happy to work as a collective, PSG will have a great season. I hope it will be as decisive as last season."
