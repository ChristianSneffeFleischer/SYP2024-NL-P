Jurrien Timber has become the latest Ajax player to be tipped to follow Manchester United managerial target Erik ten Hag to Old Trafford. Ten Hag is one of two leading candidates for the role alongside Paris Saint-Germain head coach Mauricio Pochettino, who is widely expected to leave the French capital at the end of the season. 90min revealed last month that the United hierarchy have been impressed with Ten Hag in particular and talks are ongoing over a move to the Premier League. Should the Dutchman be installed in the Old Trafford hot seat then the club's interest in Ajax's Brazilian winger Antony is set to intensify, 90min understands. Now, defender Timber has also been touted for a move to Old Trafford. Speaking on De Telegraaf's Kick-off podcast, Dutch journalist Mike Vermeij revealed Ten Hag is keen to bring the centre-back with him to Manchester and he would ask his new employers to make a deal happen. Just 20 years old, Timber is a full Netherlands international and is capable of playing in central defence or at right-back. He is also set to enter the final two years of his contract in Amsterdam. 90min reported in September that Chelsea and Tottenham were keeping close tabs on the young defender, but Ten Hag's arrival could well give United the edge. The prospective Man Utd manager spoke about the club in glowing terms last week, saying: "Everyone knows each other in the industry.  There are always talks with representatives from other clubs, that's normal.  Manchester United is a great club with great fans. "But I can only repeat myself: My full focus is completely on Ajax.  We are already planning for the new season."
