Aston Villa have confirmed the signing of full-back Matty Cash from Nottingham Forest, making the 23-year-old the first new addition to the first-team squad this summer. The deal is believed to be worth around  Â£14m and will represent Cash   s first foray into Premier League football after spending his career to date with Forest in the Championship. Welcome to the Villa, Matty Cash! ?#AVFC pic.twitter.com/cddoi6Dugb Cash broke into the Forest first-team in 2016 and went on to become a regular starter by 2018. Last season, he was named their Player of the Year in a side that narrowly missed out on the playoffs.    My agent rang me and said that Villa were interested, and immediately it was the place I wanted to come to. I said,    don   t even worry about anywhere else, I want to come here and play   ,    Cash told his new club   s official website.    It   s such a big football club, from the fanbase to the stadium. Every time I played at Villa Park before it just sold itself to me. It   s a very proud moment for me and my family, and I can   t wait to get started. Playing for such a big club is going to be brilliant.    Villa boss Dean Smith said,    We are delighted to welcome Matty to Villa and believe we have secured one of England   s brightest young prospects.    He has an excellent playing record for a young player and we believe he will settle in easily and continue his rapid development into a top full-back.    The right-back position was shared in 2019/20 between veteran Egyptian international Ahmed Elmohamady and Frenchman Frederic Guilbert in his first season in English football.
