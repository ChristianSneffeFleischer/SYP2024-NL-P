Borussia Dortmund have confirmed the signing of Koln striker Anthony Modeste on a one-year contract. BVB recruited Sebastian Haller from Ajax to replace Erling Haaland, but the Ivory Coast international later discovered a testicular tumour during a pre-season training camp in Switzerland.  Modeste is a proven Bundesliga striker and has enjoyed excellent campaigns with both Koln and Hoffenheim, most recently netting 20 league goals last season. BVB sporting director Sebastian Kehl said: ''After our analysis of last season, we made a conscious decision to recruit a classic centre-forward who could bolster our offensive game by offering physicality, a strong aerial presence and a goal threat. "In light of S  bastien Haller's illness, we are glad that, in Anthony Modeste, we have been able to add another striker with this profile to our squad for the current season. "He is a seasoned pro who knows the Bundesliga very well, who scored 20 goals last season and who, with his skillset, can fill the exact role that our coach Edin Terzic envisages for the BVB style of football."
