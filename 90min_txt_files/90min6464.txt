Tottenham Hotspur are said to be readying a move for Real Madrid wide-man Lucas V  zquez in the summer transfer window, as they look ahead to next season. The Spain international has endured a difficult year under Zinedine Zidane, with the emergence of the likes of Vinicius Jr and injury concerns, limiting V  zquez's game time.  The 28-year-old has made just 14 La Liga appearances so far in an injury-ravaged season, with the forward breaking his toe back in November, while he also recently suffered a calf injury which has kept him out of the game's since football's return. With his time perhaps coming to an end in Madrid, the three-time Champions League winner could be set to make a move to the Premier League ahead of the 2020/21 season. According to Mundo Deportivo, Spurs coach Jos   Mourinho is keen to pounce on the uncertainty surrounding his future and bring the player to north London. The Spaniard has already spoken of the 'very attractive' prospect of Premier League football and has previously been linked with Chelsea. The deal would be something of a reunion for Mourinho and V  zquez, with the winger having been in the Madrid reserve side while the former Manchester United manager was at the helm of the first-team. As for Spurs, the impact of the ongoing pandemic will likely mean that limited funds will be available and thus the Madrid man provides a potentially low cost option at just    17m.  The forwards ?
