Inter have joined Roma in the race for Manchester United defender Chris Smalling and a considering a swap deal which could see Ivan Perisic move in the opposite direction. Smalling enjoyed a successful loan spell at the Giallorossi last term and was expected to complete a permanent move this summer.  However, the two clubs have not been able to reach an agreement, with Roma   s bids falling approximately    5 million ( £4.6m) short of the Red Devils       20m valuation. Thus, with a deal yet to be struck, Inter are set to sneak in under Roma's nose. Calciomercato claims the Nerazzurri are monitoring Smalling's situation and are exploring the possibility of a swap deal in a bid to bring the Englishman to San Siro this summer.  Jo £o Mario, Ivan Perisic and Marcelo Brozovic are the players listed as options for the exchange. Perisic, however, is the most likely to garner some interest from the Red Devils as their pursuit of Borussia Dortmund superstar Jadon Sancho continues to stall. The Croatian - a former United target under Jose Mourinho - may be a handy stop-gap option before pursuing Sancho once again next summer.  Juventus winger Douglas Costa is another option for United should they fail to land the Englishman for the 2020/21 campaign.  Inter, meanwhile, are in the market for another centre-back despite the arrival of Aleksandar Kolarov from Roma earlier this month. The Serbia skipper is set to provide cover for Alessandro Bastoni on the left side of Antonio Conte's three-man defence.
