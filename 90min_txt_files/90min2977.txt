Fulham have announced the signing of Israel international Manor Solomon from Shakhtar Donetsk on a one-year deal. The 22-year-old joins the club after FIFA ruled that non-Ukrainian players are eligible to suspend their contracts in the war torn nation in order to sign elsewhere - something Solomon has now chosen to do. Speaking after his move was announced, Solomon said (via club's official website):    I'm really happy and delighted to be here at Fulham and I can't wait to feel the special atmosphere at Craven Cottage.    There are some great players here and I am determined to help Fulham achieve its goals for the year. I also want to send a big hug to my friends and supporters in Ukraine. You are in my thoughts.
