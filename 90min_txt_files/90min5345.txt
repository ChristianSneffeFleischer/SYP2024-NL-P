Borussia M  nchengladbach midfielder Denis Zakaria is a wanted man, with Manchester United, Chelsea and Bayern Munich all keeping a close eye on the 23-year-old. The Swiss international was outstanding for Gladbach last season, starring in midfield but also filling in at the back as Marco Rose's side threatened to win the Bundesliga title. He hasn't played this season as a result of a knee injury, but as noted by Christian Falk, that hasn't stopped the three European giants from considering bids. Zakaria has just two years remaining on his contract and was heavily linked with a move away during the summer, with United and Liverpool often tipped to launch  Â£45m bids to land the midfielder - but nothing ever materialised. Liverpool's interest has subsided since the arrival of Thiago Alc  ntara, but it appears as though Chelsea and Bayern have joined United in the race for his signature. Chelsea don't actually get a mention in Falk's story for Bild, which focuses largely on Bayern and their frustrations towards the perceived lack of transfer business during the summer. Manuel Neuer, Robert Lewandowski, Thomas M  ller, David Alaba and Joshua Kimmich all spoke with club officials shortly before the transfer window closed to voice their concerns over the lack of high-profile additions to the squad - particularly as Thiago, Ivan Peri  i  , Philippe Coutinho and   lvaro Odriozola had all left without being replaced. It was that meeting that prompted the arrivals of Bouna Sarr, Marc Roca, Douglas Costa and Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting, but it's noted that Zakaria was also on their wish list during the summer. Bayern snubbed the chance to sign Zakaria, instead pursuing a cut-price deal for Roca, so just how interested in him they would be next summer remains to be seen.
