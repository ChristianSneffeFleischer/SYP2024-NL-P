Former Tottenham Hotspur forward Noni Madueke has signed a new long-term contract with PSV Eindhoven, putting an end to any rumours regarding a potential summer move for the teenager.  Madueke came through the ranks in north London, but opted to leave in search of a clear path towards first-team football in 2018. He moved to PSV, where he has broken into the senior side, even earning international recognition with England's Under-21 setup. His startling development has caught the eye of several European sides with Leicester linked this window, while Spurs were also weighing up the prospect of bringing the 19-year-old back to London.  However, the Premier League sides' hopes have been quashed, after PSV announced that Madueke has signed a new long-term deal with the club, which will keep him in the Netherlands until the summer of 2025. Madueke is pictured in the announcement video, pen in hand, before informing supporters, "Don't worry guys, I'm here to stay." PSV will have been aware of the widespread interest in their starlet, and made sure to secure his services for the foreseeable future, rather than allowing his head to be turned by lucrative offers elsewhere.  The Dutch club's director of football John de Jong was delighted to have convinced the ex-Spurs starlet that his future lies in Eindhoven, while admitting the winger was attracting 'a lot of interest from foreign clubs'.
