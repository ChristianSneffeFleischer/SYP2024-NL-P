Manchester United midfielder Juan Mata has reportedly been offered a contract worth close to  £12m per year, should he decide to join an unnamed Saudi Arabian club in the weeks ahead.  Mata is out of favour under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, and is yet to feature in the Premier League this season.  He hasn't started a league game for United since February. It speaks to how good United's September was, then, that Mata was voted their player of the month, despite failing to register a Premier League minute.  It had begun to seem as if his chances of leaving Old Trafford before January had evaporated with the closure of the European transfer window, but according to Ian McGarry on the Transfer Window Podcast, he may be given one last reprieve. The 32-year-old reportedly has an offer on the table from an unnamed Saudi Arabian club, where the transfer deadline isn't until 12 November.   Thanks to everyone ?      . Let's go with everything tomorrow boys! ?? @ManUtd https://t.co/EK4SJCAsHH McGarry said: "Juan Mata has been offered a very, very lucrative deal to move from Manchester to Saudi Arabia. "It's our understanding that Mata has an offer worth around $15million  ( £11.5m) net per year to go and play in the Saudi Arabian league. "It's not clear at this moment in time that Manchester United have entered negotiations, we can't disclose the name of the club at this moment in time.  Good start to our #CarabaoCup campaign ?       @manchesterunited A post shared by  Juan Mata (@juanmatagarcia) on Sep 22, 2020 at 3:14pm PDT
