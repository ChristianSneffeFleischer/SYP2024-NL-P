Luis Campos says Paris Saint-Germain chose not to sign Ousmane Dembele because he doesn't fit into their footballing system. Dembele's future at Barcelona was very much unclear heading into the summer transfer window with his contract with the Catalan giants expiring, but he ended up signing a new contract until 2024 and staying put. Before he signed the new deal, a number of clubs were linked with him, none more so than French champions PSG. Campos - who works as PSG's Football Advisor - has now revealed that the club chose not to sign the player because of the system new manager Christophe Galtier has introduced.  "We didn   t sign Demb  l   because he   s a winger and we   re playing with another system," Campos explained, per Fabrizio Romano.  He added: "I love Demb  l  , he   s great but we had different plans." In such a system, Neymar and Lionel Messi play centrally behind Kylian Mbappe, being flanked by wing-backs.  Considering Dembele operates best in wide areas, he was not signed, with the club instead pursuing transfers closely shaped around the new manager's ideas.

PSG have enjoyed a near-perfect start to the campaign, winning all but one match with Lionel Messi thriving in the new system. The Argentina has four goals and nine assists to his name already in all competitions, and has failed to score or create a goal in only three matches.
