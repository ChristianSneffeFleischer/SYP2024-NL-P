After nearly landing the striker back in 2017, Atletico Madrid are back in the hunt to sign Alexandre Lacazette this summer and are willing to offer Arsenal a player in return. Lacazette had agreed to join the Spanish club before his move to Arsenal but a transfer ban scuppered the move. Since moving to London the Frenchman has scored 48 goals in 128 games, while he hasn't found the net as regularly as during his time in Lyon, he has impressed at the Gunners forming a formidable partnership with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.  According to Marca, Atleti have renewed their interest and will try to lure the striker to the Metropolitano Stadium this window. While the Spanish side aren't flush with cash following the COVID-19 outbreak, they will look to sweeten the deal by including a player.  Arsenal are reportedly interested in Ghanaian midfielder Thomas Partey, but Marca state Atleti are not willing to offer him in return for Lacazette. Instead, they report Thomas Lemar, Angel Correa,  or  Vitolo could be offered as part of the deal. Arsenal were interested in Thomas Lemar before his high-profile move to Atleti, but it remains to be seen whether they would re-ignite their interest. The Frenchman has had a torrid time in Spain, scoring just twice in 53 games and didn't make a single goal contribution last season.
