The legendary midfielder took the managerial job back in November, arriving to find a bloated roster that was a mash-up of hierarchal visions following the club's financial crises of the last few years. Bar  a sought to right some of their past wrongs in the January transfer window, bringing in Dani Alves, Ferran Torres, Adama Traore and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. Yusuf Demir and Philippe Coutinho left the club that month, too. Xavi has managed to turn Barcelona's season around and they will finish second in La Liga - a prospect which seemed rather unlikely when he took over with them in ninth - but the path back to their glory days is only just starting.
