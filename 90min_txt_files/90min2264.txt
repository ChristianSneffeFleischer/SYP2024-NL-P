The father of Brazilian starlet Endrick claims that only one European club have officially opened negotiations with Palmeiras over the 16-year-old forward. Despite only turning 16 in the summer, Endrick is already considered to be one of the hottest prospects in world football and has attracted interest from the likes of Barcelona, Real Madrid and Chelsea among others. However, it seems that PSG have become the first club to make their interest concrete by opening negotiations, putting them at the front of the queue for the teenager's signature. While Endrick cannot move to a European league until he turns 18, Palmeiras have accepted that the striker will be moving onto bigger and better things and expect to agree a deal with one of the interested clubs before the end of this year. Speaking to Canal do Nicola, Endrick's father Douglas said: "Paris Saint-Germain are the only club that opened negotiations with Palmeiras with an official proposal, as things stand. "There are many clubs from different countries keen on signing him. PSG have already moved."
