Barcelona midfielder Frenkie de Jong has insisted that while he does not have any ill feeling towards club president Joan Laporta, the two did have a 'situation' last summer. 90min reported extensively last year that the Dutchman was the subject of heavy interest from Manchester United, who had just appointed his former coach from his Ajax days, Erik ten Hag, as their new manager. The Red Devils were willing to meet Bar  a's lofty asking price but a major stumbling block proved to be De Jong's deferred wages from previous years, demanding to be paid them in full before thinking about an exit. Barcelona's financial struggles have been well-documented over the last couple of years and it's believed that the sale of De Jong could have significantly eased those woes. Laporta consistently said in public that he wanted De Jong to stay at Camp Nou, but behind the scenes a move to Old Trafford was never off the table despite the midfielder's preference to remain in Catalonia. Speaking to Ziggo Sport Voetbal in his native Netherlands, De Jong opened up on his relationship with Laporta.
