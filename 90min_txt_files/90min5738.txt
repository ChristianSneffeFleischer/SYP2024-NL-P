Leicester City are looking to terminate Adrien Silva's contract a year early and allow him to leave on a free transfer this summer, with interest coming from clubs in Qatar and Russia. Silva infamously signed for Leicester in August 2017, but was ineligible to play for the Foxes until the following January after the club missed out on the registration deadline by 14 seconds. He debuted on the day he was officially registered with the club, but has since failed to nail down a place in the side as a regular and is now set to leave on a free, according to FootMercato. The report states that the midfielder, who earns  Â£80,000-per-week with the Foxes, will be released despite having a year left on his deal. Head coach Brendan Rodgers sees no way into the team for the 31-year-old which has alerted Spartak and CSKA Moscow in Russia, as well as two unnamed Qatari clubs. Silva is unwilling to take up either of those options, however, as he looks to find a way back into the Portugal national team ahead of Euro 2021. Silva has also been linked with a move to Sampdoria, who are currently managed by ex-Leicester manager Claudio Ranieri. The Italian was the man to lead the Foxes to that Premier League title victory in 2015/16, but was sacked in January 2017 following a difficult follow-up season.
