Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta has been asked about the club's supposed interest in signing Kylian Mbappe. 90min understands that Paris Saint-Germain are now trying to sell the forward as he will not sign a new contract. With his deal up in 2024, they are looking to shift him this summer and avoid losing him for free. Mbappe is the subject of interest from Saudi Arabia, but sources have confirmed to 90min that he has his heart set on a move to Real Madrid instead. However, the two parties have not agreed terms over a deal, contrary to what PSG believe. Reports from both France and England have linked Arsenal with a speculative move for Mbappe, suggesting they would be the Premier League club most likely to land him should he decide to cross the Channel. feed But speaking in a press conference, Arteta refused to be drawn on such speculation. "You know I never talk about players that are not part of our team," Arteta asserted. When asked if Arsenal would make further signings this window - having already brought in Kai Havertz, Jurrien Timber and Declan Rice for over  Â£200m combined - Arteta replied: "I don   ' know. There will be movement still. There will be a lot of ins and outs. "It's still very early. Obviously the last week has been a bit quiet. If we can try and improve the team we'll do so. But we don't want to get any weaker so we have to be sure of that as well." Arsenal previously tried to sign Mbappe when he left Monaco in 2017, with former manager Arsene Wenger said to have met the forward and his family to persuade him to join the Gunners. However, he opted to join PSG instead.
