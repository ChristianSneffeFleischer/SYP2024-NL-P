Ajax are continuing talks with a number of players as they look at replacements for Antony, 90min understands. Antony is expected to become a Manchester Untied player on Tuesday as he finalises the details of his    100m switch from Ajax. The Dutch giants accepted United's bid for Antony last week and have been looking at options to help replace him. Their prime target is their former star Hakim Ziyech, now of Chelsea, and he is on the market after being informed by head coach Thomas Tuchel that he was not part of his long-term plans. Ajax, despite taking in nearly  £200m in transfer fees this summer, are keen on a loan deal for Ziyech rather than paying the near- £30m Chelsea want for a permanent deal. Talks between the two clubs have continued but the Dutch champions have also been looking elsewhere. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  &  Toby Cudworth  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Lucas Paqueta's move to West Ham, Chelsea's plans to sign Anthony Gordon, Wesley Fofana and Arsen Zakharyan and the latest from Old Trafford.
