Folarin Balogun says that he's leaving the speculation and talk over his Arsenal future to his agent and family. The 22-year-old has returned to north London after a hugely successful loan spell at Stade Reims yielded 21 goals in 37 Ligue 1 appearances last season. Balogun had previously spent time away from Arsenal on loan at Middlesbrough, where he wasn't as successful in terms of goals, but now returns to the club as a full international after recently making his debut for the United States - he's off the goalscoring mark too after netting in the Nations League final win over Canada earlier in the summer. 90min previously revealed that Arsenal had instructed Balogun's representatives to step up the search for a new club, after his camp again rejected the opportunity to negotiate a new contract, and he has stated publicly that he has no intention of being loaned out again. Inter are among a number of sides interested in signing Balogun, who looks destined to leave the Emirates Stadium unless he can impress Mikel Arteta in pre-season - something he insists he's currently focused on.

"I'm really just focused here and of course my agent and my family are dealing with this." Balogun's switch of international allegiance was warmly received by fans in the United States, who will have been fully aware of his goalscoring exploits during 2022/23 and his past appearances for England at various youth levels. But in terms of playing his club football in MLS, that appears to be a bridge too far for Balogun as he prepares to make a name for himself in one of Europe's top five leagues.
