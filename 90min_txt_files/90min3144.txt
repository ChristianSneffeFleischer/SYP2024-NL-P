Manchester United have made an increased offer to Ajax for Lisandro Martinez, and are confident of winning the race to sign the Argentinian international ahead of Premier League rivals Arsenal. 90min understands United's latest offer is worth around    50m, inclusive of bonuses, with the overall figure reaching the valuation Ajax had set to sell the 24-year-old - even if Ajax were looking for that figure guaranteed in any deal. United's previous offer was worth    43m, potentially rising to    45m with add-ons. Martinez has emerged as Ten Hag's top defensive target after United missed out on another Ajax defender, Jurrien Timber, and has already confirmed to Ajax his desire to leave the club ahead of the new season. The decision over whether to accept the bid is now left to Ajax's supervisory board. 90min has learned that United are confident that the Dutch giants' demands have been met and they will soon be able to finalise the signing. It's even believed plans for a medical are already in place. Listen now to 90min's Talking Transfers podcast, with  Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey,  Harry Symeou  &  Toby Cudworth.

Arsenal have also made more than one offer for Martinez, but it remains to be seen if they will match the latest United bid.
