Alvaro Morata has insisted he remains happy at Atletico Madrid, amid rumours he is wanted by Manchester United this summer. Morata has just returned from a two-year loan spell with Juventus, where he managed 32 goals annd 21 assists in 92 games, and he got this season off to a hot start with two goals against Getafe in a 3-0 win for Atleti. His form is said to have piqued the interest of United, who are looking for attacking reinforcements amid uncertainty over the future of Cristiano Ronaldo - the Portugal international has vowed to reveal the truth about his situation in two weeks.
