Manchester United have confirmed that six players will leave the club this summer after their contracts expired. With the calendar turning over to July, the players' contracts have now expired and they are now formally available on free transfers. The most high-profile name is that of goalkeeper David de Gea. The Spaniard's previous contract had a one-year extension clause which United declined to trigger due to concerns over his  Â£375,000-a-week wages. De Gea, who becomes a free agent on the day of his wedding, could still remain with United as the Red Devils have extended an offer and are planning to continue negotiations with the 32-year-old. "David De Gea's contract is due to run out but discussions remain open with the long-serving keeper," a statement read. feed Sticking with the first team, United have bid farewell to defensive duo Phil Jones and Axel Tuanzebe. Jones, now 31, joined from Blackburn in 2011 but struggled greatly with injuries and leaves United with 229 appearances to his name, having managed over 20 Premier League appearances in just four of his 12 seasons at Old Trafford.  Academy graduate Tuanzebe also says goodbye to his boyhood side with 37 appearances under his belt. 22-year-old midfielder Ethan Galbraith has been released alongside 20-year-old right-back Charlie Wellens and 22-year-old centre-back Di'Shon Bernard. Of the young trio, both Galbraith and Bernard managed a solitary appearance for the senior team under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in November 2019's Europa League clash with Astana.
