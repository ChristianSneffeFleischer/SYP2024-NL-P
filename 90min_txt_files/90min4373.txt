Paris Saint-Germain have reached out to Inter over a deal to sign right-back Achraf Hakimi this summer. Hakimi only arrived at Inter from Real Madrid in 2020 as the final piece of Antonio Conte's title-winning puzzle, enjoying an outstanding campaign which saw him rack up seven goals and 11 assists in all competitions. Inter would love to keep the 22-year-old, but the Italian side are in a tricky financial situation at the minute and are looking to sell around  £80m-worth of players - something Conte was so unhappy with that he left the club after winning the title. According to La Gazzetta dello Sport, Inter are considering using Hakimi to make the majority of that money, with PSG prepared to pay anywhere between  £43m and  £50m to land the Morocco international. Talks have been ongoing for a while now and are understood to be moving in the right direction, with Inter begrudgingly prepared to let Hakimi go in the hope that he would be the only significant sale of the summer. On top of being an absolute screamer of a deal for PSG, whose struggles at right-back have been going on for an eternity, a move to France for Hakimi could have some major ramifications for a handful of clubs across the continent. Star forwards Romelu Lukaku and Lautaro Martinez have both been targeted by Europe's elite, most of whom are keen to take advantage of the financial uncertainty and Conte's departure by picking the bones of the title-winning side. However, if Inter can raise the required money from selling Hakimi, they would obviously be under less pressure to sell either Lukaku or Martinez and could demand silly money from their suitors. Lukaku is on the radar of Chelsea and Manchester City, both of whom are ready to splash out on a new striker this summer.
