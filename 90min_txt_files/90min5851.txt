Crystal Palace target Flynn Downes has handed in a transfer request at Ipswich Town in order to engineer a move to the Premier League.  The central midfielder featured 32 times in all competitions for the Tractor Boys last season, scoring twice and providing a further two assists. His impressive performances have attracted the attention of top-flight clubs, with Roy Hodgson's Crystal Palace already seeing two bids rejected. #ITFC midfielder Flynn Downes has handed in a transfer request @TheAthleticUK understands, after Ipswich rejected two offers from #CPFCLatest offer for the 21-year-old worth around  £2 million.Part of a drive to sign younger talent, detailed here ??https://t.co/YE5ZxfP9Iu Now, The Athletic report that Downes has taken matters into his own hands by requesting a move away from Portman Road, in an attempt to force the club's hand. Palace's targeting of Downes is further evidence that the club are looking to freshen things up with young talent, and bring down the average age of the squad. Last season, the Eagles fielded the oldest average starting XI in the Premier League, and were often left wanting in front of goal. Manager Roy Hodgson has already dipped into the Football League in order to snare two young talents, and Downes would be another feather into the cap of Palace's new recruitment drive. 19-year-old Nathan Ferguson has joined from West Brom on a free transfer, while Eberechi Eze is another highly-rated youngster who has made the step up to Premier League level. He's joined on a five-year deal from QPR, in a deal worth close to  £20m, and will shortly be joined by 20-year-old midfielder Conor Gallagher, who is poised to join on a season-long loan from Chelsea.
