Juventus have officially confirmed the signing of Eintracht Frankfurt's Filip Kostic on a four-year deal. 90min revealed earlier this week that a deal had been struck to take Kostic to Turin, having impressed for Frankfurt in recent seasons. Juve have confirmed the deal is worth    12m with an added    3m maximum in potential bonuses, a bargain price as Kostic's contract only had one year left to run. Kostic was a key player in their Europa League triumph last season and bagged seven goals and 13 assists in all competitions.    Leaving Eintracht is the hardest sporting decision of my life,    Kostic told Frankfurt's website.    When the opportunity came about, I felt ready to try something new after eight years in Germany. I   m proud of what we   ve been able to build together. The stories we   ve written will connect us forever. I   m grateful to Markus Kr  sche and Oliver Glasner for their understanding and open discussions, and I   ll keep all Eintracht Frankfurt staff and fans in my heart.    Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  &  Sean Walsh  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Man Utd's transfer market implosion in targeting deals for Adrien Rabiot & Marko Arnautovic, Man City's stance on selling Bernardo Silva to Barcelona, Wilfried Zaha's future and more.
