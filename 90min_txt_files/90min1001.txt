Sergio Ramos has confirmed he will leave Paris Saint-Germain this summer upon the expiry of his contract. The veteran centre-back joined PSG on a free transfer from Real Madrid and is in line to make his 58th appearance for the French side in their season finale against Clermont Foot on Saturday. Questions over Ramos' future at PSG were raised when he was omitted from a graphic promoting their pre-season tour of Japan, and later on Friday, it was confirmed that the 37-year-old Spaniard will leave the club in the coming weeks. "Wearing the Red and Blue shirt for the last two years has been a wonderful experience," Ramos said. "I've had an unforgettable adventure in Paris and I'd like to thank you all for your support and love. Allez Paris!" Ramos later took to Twitter to add: "Tomorrow will be a special day, tomorrow I will say goodbye to another stage of my life, goodbye to PSG.  feed "I don't know how many places you can feel at home, but without a doubt, PSG, its fans and Paris have been one of them for me." Club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi added: "We would like to express our immense gratitude to Sergio Ramos for the two years he has spent with us. "Sergio's leadership, team spirit and professionalism, combined with his experience at the highest level, make him a true football legend, and it was an honour to have him in Paris. Everyone at the club wishes him all the best." Just what the future holds for Ramos is unclear. The veteran defender is understood to have been earmarked for a huge move to Saudi Arabia, perhaps to link up with former Real Madrid teammate Cristiano Ronaldo at Al Nassr.
