Everton are considering approaches for Anthony Gordon after a number of Premier League rivals made enquiries about signing him this month, 90min understands. Chelsea came close to landing Gordon last summer, but Everton held firm rejecting a number of bids from Stamford Bridge with the last offer worth up to  Â£45m. 21-year-old Gordon had been expected to sign a new long-term deal after Chelsea's summer assault but talks with Everton have stalled. With Everton now needing to bolster their squad in other areas, taking Gordon off their hands is seen as a real option by a number of clubs. The Toffees have already agreed a deal for Villarreal's Arnaut Danjuma, which could also help facilitate a Gordon departure. On this edition of Talking Transfers, Scott Saunders hosts Toby Cudworth & Graeme Bailey to discuss all the big transfer stories. This week's agenda includes Jude Bellingham, Harry Kane, Declan Rice, Hakim Ziyech, Leandro Trossard, Pedro Porro, Mykhaylo Mudryk and more!
