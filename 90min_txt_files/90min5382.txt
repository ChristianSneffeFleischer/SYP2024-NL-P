Crystal Palace have confirmed the signing of Nathaniel Clyne on a short-term deal, following his release from Liverpool. The 29-year-old has been without a club since leaving Anfield in June, having suffered from numerous injury problems over the past few seasons. ? Welcome back, @Nathaniel_Clyne! #CPFC | https://t.co/utMcYSDkhb Winner of 14 international caps with England, Clyne is proven at the highest level but has been unable to build on the success of his first couple of years at Liverpool. A loan spell at Bournemouth during 2018/19 was the last time he saw any competitive action, making 14 Premier League appearances for Eddie Howe's side before injury struck once more. He's now back at Palace - where his career began - on a short-term contract, and Clyne revealed his delight at being back in south London in a statement on the club's official website. "I   m a London boy, this is where I grew up. I   m back home and all my family and friends are here. It   s surreal being back, enjoying it and hopefully I can just crack on and enjoy my football again." Clyne said. Crystal Palace Chairman Steve Parish added: "Nathaniel is a fantastic character to have around this squad and we are delighted to secure his services for the upcoming period. He is a first-rate professional, just as he was when I first met him more than a decade ago. His presence and experience will be invaluable." Clyne made 137 appearances for Palace after graduating from the club's academy, spending 13 years at the club. He then joined newly-promoted Southampton in 2012, establishing himself as one of the Premier League's premier right backs.
