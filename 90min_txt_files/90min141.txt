Bayern Munich have made a club-record    100m bid for Tottenham striker Harry Kane, 90min understands. England captain Kane has been Bayern's top transfer target all summer and the two clubs recently met for talks in London. The Bundesliga giants left with optimism that a deal this summer could be struck. Bayern previously had two offers rejected, the second of which amounted to    80m ( £68.5m), and 90min can confirm their third offer totals    100m ( £86m). Spurs have been hesitant to sell but there has been pressure on chairman Daniel Levy within the club's hierarchy to consider selling Kane to avoid losing him for free next summer. Thomas Tuchel's side are unlikely to return with a higher bid if Tottenham are left unsatisfied with the third offer. Bayern do, however, want a decision over the sale to be made quickly by Spurs. Tottenham have been confident throughout the summer of keeping the 30-year-old even though his deal expires next year. The north London side remain hopeful Kane will sign a new contract and plan to work on fresh terms during Ange Postecoglou's first season in charge. feed Spurs informed Kane at the start of the transfer window they had no plans to sell him, with Manchester United, Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain among the European heavyweights eyeing a move. The start of the new Premier League season is only a week away and Spurs have brought in James Maddison, Guglielmo Vicario and Manor Solomon, also making the loans for Dejan Kulusevski and Pedro Porro permanent. Progress has been made in the pursuit of centre-back Micky van de Ven, while Spurs have also agreed to meet the release clause of Rosario Central striker Alejo Veliz.
