Mikel Arteta has admitted that while he is happy with Arsenal's transfer business so far this summer, he still wants to bring in a few more players before the deadline. The Gunners have had a busy window and are among Europe's biggest spenders after signing Marquinhos, Matt Turner, Fabio Vieira, Gabriel Jesus and Oleksandr Zinchenko. With over  Â£100m spent on incomings thus far, Arteta revealed that Arsenal still have plans to bring in further reinforcements. "We are completing what we planned," Arteta said. "There are still a few things we'd like to do, ins and outs, and that will be determined by the possibilities that are on the market. "We know where we're going to end up at the end of this window, and hopefully we can make it work." He added: "We still have some players that are in contention to stay or go, and if we have news we will communicate it."
