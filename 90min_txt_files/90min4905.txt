Manchester United have received significant interest from lower league clubs looking to take Teden Mengi and Dylan Levitt on loan until the end of the season. 18-year-old Mengi is highly thought of within United's academy and has been named in a number of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's matchday squads after making his debut for the club in last season's Europa League. MEN report that a whole host of clubs have lodged an interest in Mengi, though Solskjaer is considering retaining the services of his youngster - partly because Timothy Fosu-Mensah was recently sold to Bayer Leverkusen and also because further defensive departures are in the offing. Both Phil Jones and Marcos Rojo have been the subject of transfer speculation this month, but it remains to be seen whether the pair will leave the club in January or during the summer. As for Levitt, he was recently recalled from his loan spell with League One Charlton after United became concerned over his lack of playing time. His return has caught the attention of a number of EFL clubs, including Queens Park Rangers and Portsmouth, though he too could remain with the Under-23 squad. The 20-year-old was afforded just three league appearances in his half-season at The Valley, and Charlton boss Lee Bowyer has moved to thank the youngster for his efforts, insisting his lack of playing time was through no fault of his own.
