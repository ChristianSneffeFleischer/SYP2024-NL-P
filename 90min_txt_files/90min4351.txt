Barcelona are ready to sell Ilaix Moriba this summer amid interest from a number of Premier League clubs. Manchester United, Manchester City and Chelsea are said to be among the clubs interested in the 18-year-old whose contract with the La Liga giants has just a year to run - with his current contract having a buyout clause of  Â£86m. A previous report from Mundo Deportivo claimed Manchester United made a 'firm offer' for the midfielder which was rejected but it appears Barca's stance may have changed.  Moriba enjoyed a breakout 2020/21 campaign in which he made 18 appearances for the first team, scoring his maiden senior goal to boot.   As reported by Mundo Deportivo, Barcelona are unable to meet the economic demands being made by the player's representatives. Having previously been looked after by the Stellar Group, he's since switched to the German agency Rogon who appear to have got off on the wrong foot with the club and that has cast serious doubt over his future.
