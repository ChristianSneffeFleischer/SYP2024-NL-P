New Barcelona signing Ferran Torres has described his move to Camp Nou as a 'dream come true'. Barcelona struck a  Â£55m deal to sign Torres from Manchester City in late December and finalised the deal this month, with the 21-year-old's unveiling coming on Monday.

I   m very happy to be here. When Xavi contacted me, I wanted to come to Bar  a even more," he said.    It is a dream come true to be at Bar  a. "If I remember correctly, in the national team I played a good game against Italy and [Barcelona director] Mateu Alemany contacted my agent." Despite his excitement towards returning to Spain with Barcelona, Torres was keen to pay his respects to City, for whom he managed 16 goals and four assists in 43 appearances following his move from Valencia in 2020.    I went to City to come back one day to a big club in Spain and as soon as Bar  a called me I didn   t think twice," he continued. "It   s a great challenge.    City are one of the best. I   m ambitious and it   s a challenge to get Bar  a back to where it deserves to be. We   re very young and have a lot of room to learn. I   m looking forward to playing with my team-mates.    Barcelona are not yet able to register Torres, with Xavi recently confessing that they need to offload some players first, but the winger insisted he is not concerned by all that.    I am calm about the registration because I know that the club is working on it and I am convinced that it will be done without problems.
