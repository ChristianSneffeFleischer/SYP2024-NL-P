Antonio Rudiger's Chelsea days look numbered after the defender was left out the matchday squad for the second successive fixture. SHOP CHELSEA: Get the official 2020-21 gear straight from the source! The German was nowhere to be seen as Chelsea fell to a 2-0 home defeat to Liverpool - a game in which fellow central defender Andreas Christensen was sent off - with the same fate befalling Rudiger once more.  Full power ??? #Hustle #AlwaysBelieve @chelseafc A post shared by  Antonio R  diger (@toniruediger) on Sep 10, 2020 at 7:45am PDT Frank Lampard's side host Barnsley in the third round of the Carabao Cup on Wednesday evening, but the defender is, again, nowhere to be seen. It's a decision that is thought to be the final straw for the 27-year-old's part in the Blues' 2020/21 season, with the Daily Mail insisting he is now 'on the brink' of leaving Stamford Bridge on loan. So far, it's Paris Saint-Germain who are looking the likely outcome, and what would be a season-long switch. With two years left on his deal and no extension mooted, any 12-month loan would see Rudiger return to west London with just one year left to run on his contract - a situation Chelsea would rather avoid but are obviously fully aware could arise. Rudiger - along with all the defenders at the club - came under huge criticism last season in a Blues side that struggled to forge any notion of defensive stability. Conceding 54 goals in the Premier League last season, Lampard has since brought in Thiago Silva in a bid to strengthen the back line.
