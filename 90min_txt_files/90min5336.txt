Manchester United back-up goalkeeper Sergio Romero is willing to forego a sizeable chunk of wages in a bid to tear up the remainder of his contract at Old Trafford. Romero joined Manchester United as a free agent from Sampdoria in the summer of 2015 and has largely been used in domestic cup competitions or the Europa League as the primary replacement for the club's long-term number one, David de Gea. The Argentine international was left on the bench for the semi-finals of both the FA Cup and Europa League last season - after playing the vast majority of ties in the lead up to those final four matches.  Romero was thought to be left 'fuming' after these perceived snubs, and the Daily Star note that he's been further incensed by the club's subsequent actions. The return of Dean Henderson to Manchester United from a successful loan spell at Sheffield United prompted suggestions of Romero moving to Everton in the summer. However, a move to Goodison Park never materialised because United were unwilling to lower their  Â£10m asking price. Several members of United's squad were reportedly 'disappointed' with the club's steep and inflexible transfer demands which ultimately blocked the departure of a popular squad member. Romero's wife took to social media to voice her own frustrations, demanding that the English giants show 'RESPECT FOR ONCE!!!!'
