Manchester United are continuing their pursuit of Ajax star Antony, 90min understands. The Brazilian international has been the club's top attacking target all summer, as 90min revealed, and Erik ten Hag has made it clear to United that he wants the forward at Old Trafford. Antony was a key part of Ten Hag's Ajax side, and emerged as one of top attacking prospects in Europe in recent years. However, United are aware that Antony does come at a price and we understand that currently the Dutch champions want around    80m ( £67.3m) for the talented attacker.  As it stands we can report that United are currently looking for a deal worth    70m ( £58.9m), so the two sides are still someway apart regarding the fee.  Listen now to 90min's Talking Transfers podcast, with  Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey,  Harry Symeou  &  Toby Cudworth. On the latest show they discuss Cristiano Ronaldo holding talks with Man Utd over his future, Barcelona attempting to sign Jules Kounde ahead of Chelsea, Man City rewarding Phil Foden with a new contract and more.
