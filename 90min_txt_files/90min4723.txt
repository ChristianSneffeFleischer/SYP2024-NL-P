Exclusive - Manchester City are considering a double offer worth in excess of  £100m for Borussia Dortmund pair Erling Haaland and Giovanni Reyna in the summer. Haaland is one of the hottest prospects in world football, and has seen his star soar since swapping RB Salzburg for Dortmund in January 2020. The forward turned down City's rivals Manchester United - the club managed by his former Molde boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer - to sign for the Bundesliga outfit 13 months ago, and he is poised to have his pick of suitors once more during the 2021 summer window. To the fans. Your support is more meaningful that you   ll ever know! ?? pic.twitter.com/nDOr6B6Va5 90min understands that City are determined to win the race to sign Haaland, and are prepared to put together a package worth well over  £100m to land the striker and his Dortmund teammate Reyna. This deal would see the USA international - still aged just 18 - remain with the German club for another year. The pair each have family links to City, with their fathers both former professionals who previously spent time on the blue side of Manchester.  Former Norway international Alf-Inge Haaland played for City between 2000 and 2003, but ultimately had his career cut short by a Roy Keane challenge in the 2001 Manchester derby. Meanwhile, USMNT centurion Claudio Reyna spent three-and-a-half years with the club between 2003 and 2007. City are not prepared to enter a bidding war for Haaland, and although they have long considered themselves favourites to sign the 20-year-old, they are set to face competition from Premier League rivals Chelsea for his signature - as revealed by 90min in December.
