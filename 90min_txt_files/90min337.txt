Bayern Munich have confirmed the arrival of South Korean centre-back Kim Min-jae from Napoli. Kim was one of the top defenders in Europe last season, leading Napoli to Serie A glory and attracting plenty of interest as a result. Manchester United pursued a deal for Kim but made slow progress in negotiations over personal terms, allowing Bayern to swoop in and finalise an agreement last month. Bayern have triggered Kim's    50m release clause to get the deal done. feed Kim will take the place of Lucas Hernandez, who joined Paris Saint-Germain for a similar fee earlier this month. 26-year-old Kim has enjoyed a whirlwind few years which have seen him rise from relative obscurity to a household name. Kim was playing in his homeland until 2019, when he moved to Chinese side Beijing Guoan, and he would only move to Europe two years later when he joined Fenerbahce for a fee of    3m. One successful season in Turkey earned Kim an    18m move to Napoli and the centre-back is once again on the move after just 12 months, becoming one of the most expensive defenders of all time with this move to Bayern.
