Super Lig club Fenerbahce have officially confirmed the signing of midfielder Fred from Manchester United. The Brazil international completed his medical on Saturday in Istanbul after Fenerbahce agreed to pay  Â£13m (   15m) inclusive of add-ons for his services. Fred had also garnered interest from Fulham and Saudi Pro League clubs during the summer transfer window, with the former being unwilling to meet Man Utd's asking price and the latter not appealing to player.  Fred has now put pen to paper on a four year, with an option for a fifth year, deal at the Ulker Stadium.  Speaking to the club's official website after making the move, Fred expressed his delight at signing for "Turkey's biggest club": "I am very happy to come to Turkey's biggest club and a club with such a great history. I want to be a part of this history too. I hope everyone was happy too.  feed "My first impressions are very good and positive. Everyone at the club made me feel very welcome. I was extra happy for that too. There are very important players in the history of Fenerbahce. As Brazilians, Alex de Souza and Roberto Carlos are some of these players.  I also want to win all the trophies and contribute to all successes. Of course, I want to make the fans happy. I first played on this field for the Brazilian national team nine years ago. Now I will play for Fenerbahce fans on this field here. I can not wait for this.
