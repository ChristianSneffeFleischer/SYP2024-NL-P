Manchester United scouts are still keeping a close eye on Sporting CP left-back Nuno Mendes, who is coveted by a number of Europe's biggest clubs. United were on the lookout for a new left-back last summer and were briefly linked with 18-year-old Mendes, only to end up choosing to sign Brazilian Alex Telles from Porto in a deal worth around  Â£15m instead. However, despite just bolstering their left-back spot, O Jogo believe that United are still monitoring Mendes and want to ensure they know exactly what is going on with the teenager's career. An imminent transfer is not on the cards, with Mendes currently close to extending his contract with Sporting, but United see him as a potential option for the future if they find themselves needing to replace one of Telles or Luke Shaw. United are not alone in their pursuit of Mendes. Real Madrid, Juventus, Inter, AC Milan and Liverpool are all named as potential suitors for a player who is widely seen as one of the most exciting young left-backs in Europe. If United really are continuing to look at new, young left-backs, it seems like bad news for 20-year-old Brandon Williams. Seen as United's future in the position last season, Williams has managed just six minutes of action in the Premier League this season, with Telles' arrival seeing him tumble well down the pecking order at Old Trafford. The Telegraph are the latest outlet to touch on a potential loan move to Southampton for Williams, whose six minutes coincidentally came against the Saints in November, with Ralph Hasenhuttl keen on adding the England Under-21 international to his squad in January. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer blocked Williams' move to Southampton in the summer but is now thought to be prepared to sanction a temporary departure to ensure his career does not stall.
