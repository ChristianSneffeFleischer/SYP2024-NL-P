Chelsea manager Frank Lampard has referred to Ruben Loftus-Cheek as    our player    and insists the midfielder, who is spending this season on loan at Fulham, has a long-term future at Stamford Bridge. Loftus-Cheek missed most of last season recovering from a ruptured Achilles tendon, having made 40 appearances in all competitions for Chelsea in the 2018/19 campaign. After returning to action mostly as a substitute during    Project Restart    over the summer, the loan to Fulham this season was intended to get him back up to speed in a competitive environment. But Chelsea have no intentions of letting him go when it is over. Lampard has said he felt the Blues    missed    Loftus-Cheek last season while he was injured and is happy to see him regaining full fitness and form at Craven Cottage.    When he was getting fit, I was excited because I know the attributes he has and I wanted those attributes at the club,    Lampard explained, via ChelseaFC.com.    The conversations I had with him earlier on in the season were about him not feeling as sharp or as good as he wanted to be off the back of a really bad injury so it was question of whether he could go and play games because he felt he   d get regular game time elsewhere.    Seeing him play recently, he   s looking fit and fresh and strong. We know his obvious talents so it   s great to see. If he can keep that up hopefully through the season, and get back to exactly where he was and more, then I   ll be very happy and he   ll come back as our player for sure.
