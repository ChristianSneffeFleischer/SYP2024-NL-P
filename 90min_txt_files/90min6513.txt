Tottenham are interested in re-signing Marcus Edwards - with Manchester United also keen - from Vit  ria Guimar Â£es, a report in Portugal has claimed. Edwards only left Spurs in September last year after failing to come to terms on a new contract in north London. But a swift return to England could be on the cards, if reports abroad are to be believed. Portuguese outlet Record (via Sports Witness) claim Edwards has attracted attention from both Spurs and United, though Vit  ria are demanding between    20m and     25m for the winger - who can also play in midfield.  He has been in good form so far this season, registering seven goals and seven assists in 30 games. Vit  ria currently sit in seventh place in the Primeira Liga, which recently got underway again after being halted because of COVID-19. Edwards began his career at Spurs and was highly-rated during the formative years of his career, earning praise from then-manager Mauricio Pochettino, as well as starring for England at youth level. Despite this, he never managed to break into the first team ranks. Edwards spent time on loan at Norwich City and Dutch side Excelsior, but never made a senior league appearance for his boyhood club.   7-0?
