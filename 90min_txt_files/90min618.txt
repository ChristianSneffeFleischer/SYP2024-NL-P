Manchester United and Chelsea have come to an agreement over the transfer of Mason Mount, with a deal agreed for an initial  £55m plus  £5m add-ons, 90min understands. Mount has already agreed personal terms with United and the deal is expected to move quickly, with Chelsea giving permission for the 24-year-old to undergo a medical. He is expected to sign a five-year contract with an option for a further year. United had previously made three bids for Mount, all of which were rejected by Chelsea. The Blues countered United's last offer totalling  £55m with a proposal for a deal worth  £65m, and United had indicated at that point they were not willing to go above that offer. 90min however reported on Monday that Chelsea were willing to reduce their asking price to a fee which would total  £60m, in order to facilitate the transfer. United have now met Chelsea's compromised meet-in-the-middle offer and the deal will move forward. manual Mount, about to enter the final year of his contract, has made clear to Chelsea he is not willing to extend his deal at Stamford Bridge, and that United are the club he wants to join. The likes of Arsenal and Liverpool were interested in signing the England international before his choice became clear. Erik ten Hag has been pushing for United to sign Mount for the entire summer so far, and the 24-year-old has been United's first choice midfield target. Chelsea, meanwhile, have had a prolific week of sales - offloading Kai Havertz to Arsenal on Wednesday and Mateo Kovacic to Manchester City on Tuesday, while they have also sold, or are in process of selling, a number of players to the Saudi Pro League. Ruben Loftus-Cheek is also close to joining Milan.
