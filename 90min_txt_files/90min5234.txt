Atletico Madrid have emerged as frontrunners in the race to sign Milan's Hakan Calhanoglu, amid reported interest from Manchester United and Juventus. The 26-year-old has been one of many players to enjoy a revival of form under the tutelage of Milan head coach Stefano Pioli, but his future at San Siro remains uncertain heading into the final year of his contract. Mundo Deportivo claim, via sources in Italy, that Atletico Madrid are one of the teams to be showing an interest in Calhanoglu, who will be available for free once his aforementioned contract expires. This isn't the first time Atletico have been linked with Calhanoglu, as they were thought to be monitoring his progress during his time in Germany with Bayer Leverkusen. They were also rumoured to be considering a swap deal involving Angel Correa last year, but nothing came of that speculation either. Milan are yet to put a financial package together that will satisfy Calhanoglu's wage demands, leaving Atletico - and Manchester United - reportedly 'in the lead' to seal his signing. Juventus have also expressed an interest in Calhanoglu, although reports elsewhere suggest he rebuffed their offer when he learned of interest from United. It is worth noting that Calhanoglu isn't thought to be actively seeking a move away from San Siro, so renewing his contract should not be ruled out entirely.
