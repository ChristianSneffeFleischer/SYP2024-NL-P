Tottenham Hotspur have announced the arrival of centre-back Micky van de Ven from Bundesliga side Wolfsburg     the transfer remains subject to obtaining a work permit. As 90min reported earlier this month, Spurs agreed a  £43m deal with Wolfsburg for Van de Ven. He has now signed a six-year contract at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium until 2029. Van de Ven has already been assigned the number 37 shirt most recently worn by Kyle Walker-Peters and previously owned by Harry Kane in his earliest days with the first-team. The 22-year-old Dutchman is yet to make his senior international debut but was named in the Netherlands    2022 World Cup preliminary squad and has captained his country at Under-21 level. feed Van de Ven is the fifth new face at Tottenham this summer after Giuglielmo Vicario, James Maddison, Manor Solomon and Ashley Phillips. The  £43m price tag eclipses the  £40m that Spurs agreed with Leicester to sign Maddison back in June. Dejan Kulusevski and Pedro Porro have both also joined on permanent transfers after loan spells.
