Brighton & Hove Albion are moving on from their pursuit of Chelsea's Levi Colwill and are in talks with Ajax for defender Calvin Bassey, sources have told 90min. Colwill impressed while on loan at the Seagulls for the 2022/23 season, helping them finish above his parent club in the Premier League standings. 90min reported in June that Brighton were prepared to pay a club-record  £40m fee to sign the centre-back on a permanent deal, but Chelsea were not interested in selling. Colwill, who is still only 20, wants to sit down and talk to new Blues head coach Mauricio Pochettino before deciding on his long-term future. Brighton are prepared to admit defeat and look at other left-sided centre-back targets, and 90min understands they have opened talks with Ajax over Nigeria international Bassey. The 23-year-old made the move to Amsterdam last summer after impressing in his first two senior seasons at Rangers, helping them to the 2022 Europa League final. feed But Bassey has failed to find his feet in the Netherlands and Ajax will consider offers for the defender, with Brighton hoping to agree terms on a  £15m deal. Bassey is a long-term target of Brighton, who have been admirers since his days at Rangers. He would provide much-needed European experience as the Seagulls make their first venture into the Europa League next season. Roberto De Zerbi's side have already brought in Joao Pedro, Mahmoud Dahoud, James Milner and Bart Verbruggen this summer, though have sold Alexis Mac Allister to Liverpool. Moises Caicedo is also expected to leave - 90min understands that Manchester United have made contact with Brighton regarding a transfer, while Chelsea are also interested.
