Chelsea are closing in on the signing of Manchester City and England winger Raheem Sterling. The England international has agreed personal terms and a deal between the two clubs is expected to settle around  £45m. The Blues have also agreed terms with Netherlands defender Nathan Ake, but again are yet to agree a fee with City. The 27-year-old could cost upwards of  £40m. Barcelona are prioritising their pursuits of Raphinha and Robert Lewandowski, which could cost them the signing of Sevilla centre-back Jules Kounde - another leading target for Chelsea. Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag is interested in another of his former Ajax pupils, forward Brian Brobbey. The 20-year-old is currently at RB Leipzig, though returned to Amsterdam last year, and could be seen as alternative option to Cristiano Ronaldo. Real Madrid are prepared to sanction a departure for French full-back Ferland Mendy amid interest from Juventus. A fee of    45m is likely to be enough to prise him away from Santiago Bernabeu. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp wants the club to sign Real Madrid winger Marco Asensio, while there's also hope from Juventus that the Reds will bid for Matthijs de Ligt in order to spark a bidding war with Chelsea.
