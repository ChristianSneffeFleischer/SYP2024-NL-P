Real Salt Lake have completed the permanent transfer of Ecuadorian forward Anderson Julio from Liga MX side Atletico San Luis. Julio signs for an undisclosed fee on a deal through the 2024 season with options on the 2025 and 2026 campaigns. The 25-year-old returns to Rio Tinto Stadium after spending the 2021 season on loan with RSL, scoring eight goals in 30 regular-season appearances and netting again in one of his three MLS Cup Playoff outings to help the club reach the Western Conference final.     Bringing Julio back to the RSL family has been a top priority during the last several months,    Real Salt Lake general manager Elliot Fall said in a club press release.     We know what he brings on and off the field, in the locker room and throughout the community. Securing his permanent transfer and his long-term rights as opposed to another season-long loan has been our goal, and we are elated to welcome him back, get him into game shape and watch him flourish as part of our culture.    Five of Julio's eight regular-season goals come in the 88th minute or later as the forward became an effective option from the bench. Real Salt Lake lead MLS in goals scored after the 75th minute in 2021.
