Bayern Munich are looking to secure the loan signing of Barcelona right-back Sergi Roberto. Die Roten are keen to strengthen their options at full-back this summer and after welcoming left-sided defender Omar Richards to the club, they're now looking to bring in a new right-back. Bayern have drawn up a shortlist including Sergino Dest and Chelsea's Emerson, though Goal report that Roberto has emerged as their main target after the club contacted Bar  a with a view to a season-long loan move. Roberto was understood to be on the verge of penning a new deal at Barcelona earlier this year, yet an agreement couldn't be reached and as such the Spaniard is out of contract next summer. While a loan move for a player whose contract expires next summer may seem like silly business from Barcelona - and let's be honest, they're no strangers to it - it's hoped that the positive relationship between the clubs following the loan move of Philippe Coutinho to Bayern could see an agreement reached over a fee.
