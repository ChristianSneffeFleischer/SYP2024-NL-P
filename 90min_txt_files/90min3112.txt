Aston Villa have confirmed an agreement has been reached with Sevilla for the loan signing of Ludwig Augustinsson. The 28-year-old has been drafted in as a replacement for Matt Targett, who joined Newcastle on a permanent basis earlier this summer, and will provide competition for Lucas Digne at left back. Augustinsson has been capped 46 times by Sweden, scoring two goals, but has only been with Sevilla for a single season after bringing to an end a four-year spell at Werder Bremen. He featured in 19 La Liga games and 25 in all competitions during 2021/22, most notably appearing against West Ham United in the Europa League - a last 16 tie the six-time winners surprisingly lost 2-1 on aggregate.
