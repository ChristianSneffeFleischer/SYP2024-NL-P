Tottenham Hotspur have internally admitted that they were wrong not to follow up on initial interest in South Korea centre-back Kim Min-jae following his excellent start to life at Napoli, 90min understands. 90min reported in September 2020 of Spurs' interest in the defender, who was then on the books at Chinese Super League side Beijing Guoan, and that they had consulted Son over the prospect of such a deal. However, despite Son's ringing endorsement of Kim, Tottenham were unwilling to spend more than  Â£10m on a deal and he ended up signing for Fenerbahce the following summer instead. After just one year in Turkey, Kim earned an    18m move to Napoli this summer, and he has played a starring role in their incredible start to the 2022/23 season. Gli Azzurri sit top of the Serie A table and look a safe bet to finish first in their Champions League group in part thanks to their 4-1 thrashing of Liverpool in September, with Luciano Spalletti's side unbeaten in all competitions. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  and  Toby Cudworth  are joined by  Tom Gott  in the latest episode of Talking Transfers. The team discuss Erling Haaland's Manchester City release clause, Mason Mount's future at Chelsea and their sporting director plans, and what the future could hold for 700-goal Cristiano Ronaldo at Man Utd.
