Wolves are finally set to conclude the signing of Joao Gomes after winning their stand-off with Flamengo, sources have confirmed to 90min. 90min revealed earlier in January that Wolves had agreed terms with Flamengo, but at the point of exchanging contracts the Brazilian club did not return documents at their end. Wolves then struggled to communicate with Flamengo and it emerged that talks had begun with French side Lyon, who made a bid worth    19m ( Â£16.7m) - that was    2m more than Wolves offered. However, despite Lyon's determination to persuade Gomes otherwise, the player refused to move to France. Instead, he insisted he wanted to move to the Premier League and even new Lyon owner John Textor made a personal trip to try and convince him to no avail.
