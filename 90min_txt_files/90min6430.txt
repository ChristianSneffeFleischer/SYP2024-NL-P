Crystal Palace are ready to offer English teenager Danny Loader a three-year contract, following his exit from Reading.  Loader, who made his debut under Jaap Stam when he was 16, departed Reading on after he failed to agree a new contract with the Berkshire side.

The England youth international was part of Steve Cooper's Under-17 World Cup winning squad in 2017, alongside superstars such as Borussia Dortmund's Jadon Sancho and Manchester City's Phil Foden. The forward registered two goals at the tournament - both coming in England's final group game against Iraq.
