Caglar Soyuncu has signed a pre-contract with Atletico Madrid ahead of a summer switch to Spain, 90min understands. Soyuncu joined Leicester in 2018 and quickly established himself as a key player for the Foxes, even earning a spot in the 2019/20 PFA Team of the Year, but he later fell out of favour under Brendan Rodgers. With his contract winding down, Soyuncu began speaking with Atletico in January and had even been tipped to move to Spain during the winter window. Such a move broke down, however, forcing Los Rojiblancos to focus on a summer transfer instead. Terms of a contract were agreed soon after and sources have now confirmed to 90min that Soyuncu has put pen to paper on a four-year contract feed Soyuncu will head to Madrid in the summer and bring an end to his five-year spell with Leicester, in which he helped lead the Foxes to their first-ever FA Cup glory in 2020/21. The 26-year-old would remain a starter for the majority of the 2021/22 campaign but was an unused substitute for the final five games of the season, and he appeared just twice this year before Rodgers was dismissed, starting October's 1-0 defeat to City before seeing seven minutes towards the end of the 4-2 win over Aston Villa in February. Soyuncu regularly failed to make the bench during Rodgers' final season but has been quickly reinstated by interim boss Dean Smith, starting each of the three games to date. However, he has now opted to take his talents to Madrid, where he will join an Atletico side left short on centre-backs following Felipe's January switch to Nottingham Forest.
