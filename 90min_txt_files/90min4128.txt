You'd probably assume that upon winning your first title in 11 years, the message from the boardroom would be 'same again next year, lads.'  But this has been no ordinary summer for the current champions of Italy. After winning the scudetto in swashbuckling style, Antonio Conte walked away from Inter due to the club's precarious financial state and the subsequent cuts that would have to be made to the playing staff.   The Nerazzurri need to generate some serious cash this summer, although the departure of Achraf Hakimi has already landed them a cool    70m. The wing-back needs to be replaced however, while new coach Simone Inzaghi must address other problematic areas in the squad.  So, let's have a look at how Inter could line up for the 2021/22 campaign.  Samir Handanovic (GK) - He may be getting on in years, but Handanovic has got at least one more campaign in him at the very top. 37 years young, the shot stopper played a crucial role in Inter's success last season.Milan Skriniar (CB) - Several clubs have stated their interest in Skrinar in recent windows, but Milan won't be leaving his namesake city just yet. The time may come when he accepts a new challenge, but right now, few clubs boast the funds to afford him.Stefan de Vrij (CB) - Inter's best defender last season, De Vrij will be strutting his stuff at San Siro for the next 12 months, at least. The Dutchman is living the dream in Milano, and has earned his place in a league-winning defence. Alessandro Bastoni (CB) - If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Bastoni completes a backline that realistically needs no surgery and will be kept together for the next season. The consistency needed to win titles starts at the back.
