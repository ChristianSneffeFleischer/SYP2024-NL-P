Young Liverpool midfielder Tyler Morton has left the club to join Championship side Blackburn Rovers on a season-long loan. The 19-year-old enjoyed a smattering of first-team appearances last season, including starts against Milan and Porto in the Champions League group stage. His full Premier League debut followed in December against Tottenham. Morton has also been afforded minutes in pre-season under Jurgen Klopp, meaning Rovers had to wait patiently to get a deal done. The England Under-20 international became Blackburn's second signing of the summer following the arrival of Barnsley full-back Callum Brittain on a permanent deal. Sammie Szmodics' move from Peterborough United was announced shortly afterwards. Speaking upon the central midfielder's arrival, Rovers    director of football Gregg Broughton said:    We have had to wait patiently for Tyler, as he has been so close to Liverpool   s first team for the whole of pre-season, but after seeing what he did in some big games for Liverpool last year, we believe he was worth waiting for.
