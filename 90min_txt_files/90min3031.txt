Hasan Salihamid  i   has confirmed Bayern Munich are nearing an agreement with Crystal Palace for center-back Chris Richards, though 90min understands the player is yet to fully agree terms. As reported by 90min, clubs from the UK, France, and Germany have all been chasing the 22-year-old this summer, with sources insisting Richards' main focus has been securing regular minutes to win back his spot on the United States Men's National Team ahead of the World Cup. Leeds United, Southampton, and Brighton were among the early frontrunners from the Premier League but, according to Florian Plettenberg, it's Crystal Palace who have agreed terms with Bayern.  Former Bayern wideman Salihamid  i   - now the club's sporting director - confirmed to Bild:    We   re holding talks.    The Eagles are expected to pay between    15m-20m ($15.3m-$20.5m) for Richards' services, with MLS club FC Dallas expected to receive 35% of that fee as a sell-on clause. It has been reported that Richards has already agreed personal terms with Palace. However, a source close to the situation has told 90min that while talks are progressing well, Richards is yet to fully agree a deal with any club. Richards has been with Bayern Munich since 2018 following a successful trial period having previously developed in the FC Dallas youth system - also responsible for talents such as Weston McKennie, Ricardo Pepi, Reggie Cannon, and Justin Che.
