Everton have enquired about taking Aston Villa winger Anwar El Ghazi on loan for the rest of the season, 90min understands. The two clubs are on the verge of completing another piece of business having agreed a  Â£25m fee for Lucas Digne, who is set to undergo a medical before sealing a move to Villa Park. The capture of Digne - who had been of interest to Chelsea - represents another marquee January signing for Steven Gerrard's side, following the arrival of former Liverpool star Philippe Coutinho on loan from Barcelona. One player who could be leaving the club this month is El Ghazi. The Dutchman has made just four substitute appearances in all competitions since Gerrard took the reins in mid-November, failing to lay claim to a place in the new manager's plans. 90min understands Everton have approached Villa about the possibility of taking the 26-year-old former Lille and Ajax man on loan for the rest of the season. However, the Midlands club would prefer a permanent sale for a player who has flattered to deceive since arriving from Ligue 1 ahead of Villa's return to the Premier League in 2019, although it is believed they will listen to the Toffees' proposal. El Ghazi enjoyed a fruitful first half of his debut season before his form tailed off, and was streaky last campaign despite netting 11 goals in all competitions. Everton have already splashed cash on defenders Vitaliy Mykolenko and Nathan Patterson so far this month, with manager Rafael Benitez looking to recover the Toffees' torrid form since September.
