Karim Benzema has made it known to Real Madrid that he intends to stay with the club and will not now take up an offer to move to Saudi Arabia, sources have confirmed to 90min. The 35-year-old initially agreed fresh terms on a new one-year deal with Real back in March and was due to sign that at the end of this season. However, he then fielded an offer from Saudi Arabia's Pro League to join new champions Al-Ittihad on a two-year deal that would have been worth    200m. Benzema conveyed the news he was leaving to president Florentino Perez in a meeting on Thursday, during which the Real supremo made it clear they wanted him to stay. But the Frenchman at that point had decided to end his Madrid career after 14 years. feed However, sources have now told 90min that further meetings have been held, at which Benzema decided he would indeed stay for another season at the Santiago Bernabeu. Whilst Real were shocked and had not planned for Benzema's departure, their transfer team headed by Juni Calafat was already working on potential replacements - which was headed by Harry Kane However, Benzema's decision now means Real can again focus on other areas of their squad, which includes finalising a deal for England star Jude Bellingham.
