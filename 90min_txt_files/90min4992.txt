Barcelona have confirmed midfielder Carles Alena has joined Getafe on loan until the end of the season. Alena has barely featured for Bar  a so far this season, making only five appearances in all competitions. The Masia youth product was sent out on loan to Real Betis last season, where he featured prominently, and will be hopeful of a similar spell with Getafe. The Catalan club confirmed his departure via a statement published on their website, which reads: "FC Barcelona and Getafe CF have reached an agreement for the loan of the player Carles Alena until the end of the 2020/21 season. The Madrid club will take over the player's wages." Getafe will be hoping that their new signing can help them pull away from the La Liga relegation places. After finishing eighth last term, Jose Bordalas' side have struggled this time out and are currently 16th, just one point above the drop zone having played a game more than 18th placed Elche. Ronald Koeman will be hoping Alena's departure will not be the only move that Bar  a makes this month.
