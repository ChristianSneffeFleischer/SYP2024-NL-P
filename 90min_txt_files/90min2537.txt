Liverpool have completed a deal to sign Brazilian midfielder Arthur Melo on a season-long loan from Juventus. The Reds have been looking for a new midfielder all summer - Jurgen Klopp recently confirmed they missed out on their top target - and have seen their desire for reinforcements strengthened by a string of injuries. Thiago, Naby Keita and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain are all currently sidelined, while Curtis Jones returned to the bench for Wednesday's victory over Newcastle to see captain Jordan Henderson limp off with a hamstring injury. Klopp admitted to needing more bodies in midfield late last month and a deal has now been struck to bring Arthur in from Juventus. Juve have confirmed that the deal has set Liverpool back    4.5m and includes a    37.5m buy option.

"I   m really, really happy to be here wearing this great shirt with this famous badge that represents so much in world football, it   s a dream," Arthur told Liverpool's official website. "We talked a lot, and our ideas and visions were a good fit so I   m sure it was the right choice. I   m really happy and highly motivated to continue living my dream on the pitch and giving my all in a Liverpool shirt."
