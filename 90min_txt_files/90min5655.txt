Leicester have confirmed the signing of Roma winger Cengiz   nder on a season-long loan deal from the Serie A side. The 23-year-old has struggled to nail down a starting spot since joining the Giallorosso as a highly-rated youngster from Turkish side Istanbul Basaksehir back in 2017, scoring 17 goals in 88 appearances.  ? #  nderTaken ? pic.twitter.com/gznqopgpBT Because of this, Roma were willing to let him depart and he has reportedly agreed a five-year deal at the King Power Stadium. He becomes Leicester's second signing of the transfer window, after they secured a deal for Atalanta right-back Timothy Castagne earlier this month.  The move was announced with a couple of nods to WWE star The Undertaker. Brendan Rodgers has long been looking to strengthen his options going forward and relieve some of the goal scoring burden off of star striker Jamie Vardy. The Foxes had a  £45m offer for Barcelona's Francisco Trincao turned down in the summer and they have also been linked with Bournemouth midfielder David Brooks.  pic.twitter.com/ew6YujfOQg However, it is Under who has arrived first for a reported future fee of    27m ( £24.6m). The wideman said he was excited to have completed his Premier League move.  He said: "I can   t wait to go to Leicester and start training. I   ve always wanted to play in England and this is a great opportunity to play in the Premier League.    I will try to help my teammates on the pitch and off the pitch and I believe that I can improve my performance every day. I think I am fast and can create lots of chances for my colleagues.
