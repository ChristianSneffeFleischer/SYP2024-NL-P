Chelsea have confirmed the capture of Leicester City and England left-back Ben Chilwell on a five-year deal.  The 23-year-old has been linked with a move away from the Foxes for some time, with Manchester City and Manchester United both being touted as possible destinations in the past.  However, the Blues have managed to win the race for Chilwell and announced the move via their website.
