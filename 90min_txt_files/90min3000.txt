Antonio Conte has insisted that Bayern Munich's public courting of Harry Kane is 'a bit disrespectful' and that the striker is an important part of his Tottenham project. Bayern's interest in Kane has been floated in the German press in recent weeks, while manager Julian Nagelsmann recently admitted that while the striker would score plenty of goals in the Bundesliga, the club probably don't have the financial muscle to submit an acceptable bid to Spurs. Speaking after Kane scored a brace in a 2-1 pre-season win over Rangers on Saturday, Conte admitted that he hadn't heard Nagelsmann's comments yet, but couldn't hide his annoyance at Bayern talking about his player in public. "Honestly I didn't hear this," Conte began. "For sure I'm a coach who doesn't talk about players from other teams. I don't know why [this happened]. The situation at Tottenham is very clear. The plan is very clear with the club.  Harry is a part of the project. He is a very important part of the project and yeah only rumours. "At the same time I repeat I don't like to speak about players from another club. If I want to do something I go to speak to the club, not through the media. I think maybe it's a bit disrespectful for the other club. This is my way. This is my way to face the situation with other players."
