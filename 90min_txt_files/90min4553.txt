New England Revolution forward Tajon Buchanan is attracting interest from several top European clubs.  The 22-year-old emerged as an important player for the MLS side last year, featuring in every regular season and playoff game as Revs were knocked out in the semi-finals by eventual champions Columbus Crew. He also chipped in with three goals and three assists.  As reported by MLS Multiplex, one of 90min's sister sites, Buchanan's performances have attracted interest from across the Atlantic. Sporting CP, who have a superb reputation for developing young players, are one side sniffing around. The Portuguese giants are keen on the player and although no contact has been made, he is very much on their radar. There is also said to be interest from several Premier League and Ligue 1 clubs. Buchanan is comfortable on either wing, although he spent the majority of last season operating down the right hand side. Revolution took him in the first round of the 2019 MLS Superdraft and he has gone onto be one of the success stories of that draft class.  He was also part of the Canada Under-23 side that fell just short in qualification for this summer's  Olympics. He bagged a brace in a group game against El Salvador last month before the Reds were eliminated by Mexico.
