 Jose Mourinho has revealed that although Tottenham will not be able to spend as freely as their rivals during the transfer window, he is 'totally convinced' that his squad will be stronger come next season. Spurs have endured a fairly underwhelming campaign though they could still finish in the top six if results go their way on Sunday.  COVID-19 has left the club with quite the financial shortfall and Mourinho will not be given as much freedom to operate in the transfer market as Chelsea and Manchester United. However, the 57-year-old has insisted that he is not focussed on what other clubs do this summer, also stressing the importance of responsible levels of spending.  "The targets are linked to what we can do," Mourinho said ahead of Sunday's visit to Crystal Palace (via the Standard).  Stay calm, but it looks like the Spurs squad is starting to respond to Jose's tactics. |        @judesummerfield "Internally we don   t have any contradictions, I am not asking for anything that cannot be done and the club is not promising anything that is going to affect the club as a whole     so we are balanced. "We can all look to a neighbour and see he is buying and buying and buying and spending and spending and spending     but we don't have to react to that. We have to just follow our decisions and do what we can do." Harry Kane is one of several Spurs players to be linked with a move away from north London recently but Mourinho claimed that does not plan to let any first teamers depart in the upcoming transfer window.
