Real Madrid have confirmed they have agreed a deal with Serie A side Fiorentina for the sale of striker Luka Jovic. The Serbian striker was excellent during his spell at Eintracht Frankfurt, with 17 Bundesliga goals during the 2018/19 proving enough to convince Los Blancos to sign him for    60m. However, he never managed to get a consistent run of games, rarely being trusted by either Zinedine Zidane or Carlo Ancelotti in their starting XI. He returned to Frankfurt on loan last season but has now left the Bernabeu permanently, signing a two-year deal with Fiorentina. Real's statement reads: "Real Madrid C. F. and ACF Fiorentina have agreed a deal for the transfer of Luka Jovi  . "Our club would like to express its gratitude for his work and dedication during his time at Real Madrid, where he has won 1 Champions League, 2 LaLiga titles and 2 Spanish Super Cups.
