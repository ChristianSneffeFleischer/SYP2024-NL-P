Chelsea have finally agreed a deal with Brighton & Hove Albion for Marc Cucurella, 90min understands. The Blues were close to reaching an agreement with Brighton on Wednesday, but the Seagulls were quick to publicly stress that terms had not been finalised. Now 90min can confirm that Chelsea will pay  £55m for the 24-year-old with a further  £7m possible in add-ons - meaning the deal could very well surpass the  £60m mark. Cucurella, who had already agreed personal terms with Chelsea, was given permission by Brighton to travel to London on Wednesday and he has already completed most of his medical. His switch to Stamford Bridge is likely to be confirmed by midday on Friday, meaning he will be eligible to play for his new team in their season opener at Everton on Saturday. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  &  Sean Walsh  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Chelsea's plans to sign Marc Cucurella and Wesley Fofana. There's the latest on James Maddison, Jamie Vardy, Cristiano Ronaldo and Frenkie de Jong, and chat on Diogo Jota's new deal and Roberto Firmino's Liverpool future.

With Cucurella heading to Stamford Bridge, highly-rated teenager Levi Colwill will head in the other direction - although it's taken Chelsea and Brighton a while to agree the nature of the move. Colwill was due to arrive on a permanent basis with a buyback clause, but the two clubs have now agreed to a straight loan. As it stands, the deal will not include an option to buy although that could change as terms are not yet fully finalised.
