Real Madrid have confirmed Brahim Diaz has signed a new four-year contract upon his return to the club. Los Blancos parted with an initial  Â£15.5m to sign Diaz from Manchester City in January 2019 but watched as the Spanish youngster struggled to make an impact, eventually sending him out on a one-year loan to AC Milan in the summer of 2020. Diaz would later return to Milan on a fresh two-year loan deal, during which he established himself as a key player for the Serie A side, winning the league title in 2021/22, and he has now returned to Spain to take up a role in Real Madrid's first team once again. Upon his return, Diaz has inked a new deal to tie himself to Los Blancos until the summer of 2027. The 23-year-old will be presented to the media once again on Tuesday, 13 June. feed Diaz made 21 appearances for Real Madrid during his first 18 months on the books, chipping in with two goals and three assists and spending most of his time on the bench or out the squad. His loan to Milan afforded Diaz the opportunity to reignite his career and he leaves Italy as a Serie A champion having racked up no fewer than 124 appearances for the Rossoneri. 2022/23 was the most productive season of Diaz's senior career. The Spaniard bagged six goals and seven assists for Milan, playing largely in an attacking midfield role but also appearing on the left wing occasionally. Diaz's return to Real Madrid will help fill the void left by the departures of Karim Benzema, Eden Hazard, Marco Asensio and Mariano Diaz.
