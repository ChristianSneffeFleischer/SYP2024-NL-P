Nottingham Forest have agreed a deal to sign left-back Renan Lodi on loan from Atletico Madrid, who are closing on Tottenham's Sergio Reguilon as his replacement. Forest have already brought in two left-backs this summer, Harry Toffolo and Omar Richards, but the latter has been sidelined with a leg fracture and so Steve Cooper's side have been pursuing a third new signing for the role. A number of players were identified as possible targets, including Reguilon, but 90min understands that Forest have settled on Lodi and an agreement has been struck to bring the 24-year-old in on a season-long loan. As part of the agreement, Forest will also have the option to purchase Lodi permanently next summer. Lodi is now set to become Forest's 19th signing of the summer and that number is soon expected to rise to 20, with sources confirming that talks with former Tottenham right-back Serge Aurier are close to a positive resolution. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  &  Toby Cudworth  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Lucas Paqueta's potential move to West Ham, Chelsea's plans to sign Anthony Gordon, Wesley Fofana and Arsen Zakharyan and the latest from Old Trafford.
