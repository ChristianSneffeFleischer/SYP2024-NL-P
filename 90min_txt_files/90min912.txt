Manchester United are concerned their plans to sign a new elite defender could be scuppered if Harry Maguire refuses to accept an exit from Old Trafford, 90min understands. Still the most expensive defender of all time after his move from Leicester in 2019, Maguire dropped down the pecking order in Erik ten Hag's debut season with Lisandro Martinez and Raphael Varane the preferred centre-back combination. 90min previously revealed Tottenham have shortlisted the England international while his agents believe a move to Serie A, where Juventus and Inter have shown interest, would be his best option. Other Premier League sides like Newcastle and West Ham are also monitoring the situation, though 90min understands Maguire is keen to battle for a more regular starting XI spot. United are keen to add another defender to their ranks and have held talks with Napoli's Kim Min-jae, who has a clause in his contract which allows him to leave for less than  Â£50m at the start of July. If Maguire refuses to budge, United may change their transfer strategy in defence. feed Some club officials still hope to draft in another centre-back regardless of Maguire's stance or the future of Victor Lindelof. The Swede is known to have impressed Ten Hag in the backend of the season when Martinez and Varane were sidelined by injuries. Maguire is contracted at Man Utd until 2025 with the option of another year and his England credentials have not been harmed as of yet by his reduced playing time under Ten Hag. However, Three Lions manager Gareth Southgate admitted in May it would be difficult to keep picking the 30-year-old if he continues to go unused at Old Trafford. Maguire started eight Premier League games in 2022/23 and was a regular in United's cup XI both domestically and in the Europa League.
