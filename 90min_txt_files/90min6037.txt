Former Burnley and Manchester City keeper Joe Hart is set to complete a surprise move to Tottenham, and will sign an initial two-year deal in north London. Spurs have been on the lookout for a new third-choice keeper after the departure of Michel Vorm. They are reportedly keen to add to their homegrown quota and Hart, following his exit from Burnley, fits that bill. Joe Hart having medical @SpursOfficial. Will join Lloris and Gazzaniga. The deal was initially reported by The Times but is now being spread far and wide, with the BBC's Simon Stone claiming a medical is now underway. Spurs already have two established keepers in Hugo Lloris and backup Paulo Gazzaniga, but 33-year-old Hart will add some experience to their ranks.  The 75-time England cap, who twice won the Premier League with Man City, made 19 appearances for Burnley in 2018/19, but was restricted to a backup role last season with Nick Pope's re-emergence as first choice. Chelsea were believed to hold an interest in securing Hart on a similar deal, but it's Spurs who have moved first and successfully avoided one of the most bizarre tug-of-war games ever seen in English football.  The Times say he has taken a wage cut from  £50,000 per week at Burnley and will earn  £35,000 at Spurs. His contract will run to 2022, with the standard option of a third year.  #thfc Per @mcgrathmike, understand Joe Hart is set to join Spurs on a free. Also told Oliver Skipp is heading to Norwich on loan for the season. @standardsport.
