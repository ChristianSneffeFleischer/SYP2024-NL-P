Marcel Sabitzer remains a target for Tottenham Hotspur, with the north London side's interest in the RB Leipzig playmaker dating back to before the first UK lockdown. Sabitzer enjoyed a stunning 2019/20 campaign with Leipzig, grabbing 16 goals and 11 assists as the Bundesliga side raced into the Champions League semi-finals. He scored twice against Tottenham in the second leg of the competition's last 16 tie in March as Leipzig ran out comfortable 4-0 winners on aggregate. Just days after his performance at the Tottenham Hotspur stadium, it was reported that both Spurs and north London rivals Arsenal were monitoring Sabitzer's progress. According to German news outlet Sport Bild, the Austrian international remains on Tottenham's 'wish list'. His contract runs until 2022, and should Sabitzer opt to not extend his stay with Leipzig, the two upcoming transfer windows could be the club's final opportunity to cash in on the 26-year-old.

However, this has since been slashed, with Bild reporting a    30m valuation. The Austrian playmaker offers real versatility, having operated in central midfield, attacking midfield and on the right flank.  This is an area where Spurs are currently not short on options, with Son Heung-min, Steven Bergwijn, Lucas Moura, Erik Lamela, Gareth Bale, Giovani Lo Celso and Dele Alli, meaning someone may have to depart should Sabitzer join the club. When questioned about his future and the links to Tottenham in April, Sabitzer admitted he was 'open to anything'.
