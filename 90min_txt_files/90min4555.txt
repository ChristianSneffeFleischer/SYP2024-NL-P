Pep Guardiola has refused to rule out the possibility of spending  Â£100m on a player this summer but remained coy when asked about speculation linking him with a move for Borussia Dortmund's Erling Haaland. The Catalan tactician recently dismissed the suggestion that City could embark on a summer transfer splurge in a bid to replace the outgoing Sergio Aguero, claiming the club simply can't afford to do so. The Premier League leaders face Dortmund in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final on Tuesday night - offering Guardiola the chance to see Haaland in action - and while he claims the club have decided not to spend big money this summer, he didn't rule out the possibility of a late change of heart. "Maybe in the future, it's going to happen when the club decide it's necessary to improve the team for the next five or ten years," he said as reported by Sky Sports. "But so far the club, the organisation, the CEO, the sporting director, have decided not to do it and that's why they haven't done it. Maybe in the future, I don't know." With big-money arrivals clearly not an impossibility at City this summer, Guardiola was asked how much he believed Haaland was worth, though he refused to be drawn on the topic. "I don't know, it is a question for Borussia Dortmund and his agent," he added. "I understand people ask about Haaland, he is an exceptional striker, but it is not appropriate for me to talk about him." With an unprecedented quadruple on the cards this season, Guardiola was quick to quash suggestions that City's fine Premier League form would have any impact on their displays in other competitions.
