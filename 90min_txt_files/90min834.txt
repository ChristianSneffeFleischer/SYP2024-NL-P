Real Madrid's newest star Jude Bellingham has been asked about the club's plans to bring in Kylian Mbappe and Harry Kane this summer. Bellingham completed his long-anticipated move to Los Blancos for an initial    103m fee this week, signing a six-year contract in the Spanish capital. Just is the case with all new Galacticos, Bellingham held an introductory press conference in Madrid following his arrival, revealing that he would be taking the number five shirt which was made iconic during Zinedine Zidane's time at the club. While most questions were focused on Bellingham himself and his love for Real Madrid, he was asked about a couple of pieces of other transfer business. He was first asked by Sky Sports about the possibility of being joined in Spain by England teammate Kane, who is on Real Madrid's shortlist for Karim Benzema replacements. "As far as the Harry Kane rumours go, I can't comment on that," Bellingham batted away. "He's a world-class player, he's my captain; I love him as a player and a person. Whatever happens there happens." feed Bellingham was then asked about Real Madrid's long-standing interest in Mbappe, who could leave PSG this summer after indicating he would not be signing a new contract. "I can't really comment, I don't know his situation. If anything, my whole saga has taught me that not everything you see is true," Bellingham added, before admitting he would like to rub shoulders with the Frenchman. "He's a great player, whatever he chooses to do, all the best to him. Would I like to play with a player like Kylian Mbappe? Who wouldn't?"
