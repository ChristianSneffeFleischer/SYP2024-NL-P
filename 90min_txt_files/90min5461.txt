Leeds United have confirmed the signing of Brazilian winger Raphinha from Rennes, for a fee believed to be close to  Â£20m after add-ons.  Leeds had been keen to add a new wide-man to their squad all window, with minimal depth available outside of Jack Harrison and Helder Costa, who both extended their stays at the club this summer. It's taken them to the last minute to sign one, but patience has paid off, and 23-year-old Raphinha has joined the Yorkshire outfit on a four-year deal.        #WelcomeRaphinha pic.twitter.com/CrlegrbE2n He will wear the club's number 18 shirt, and will be available for selection immediately after the international break.
