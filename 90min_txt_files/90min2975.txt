Southampton have confirmed the signing of Bordeaux forward Sekou Mara, who has signed a four-year deal. The 19-year-old enjoyed a breakout season in Ligue 1 during 2021/22, scoring six goals in 26 top flight appearances. Saints forked out    13m to Bordeaux, who need cash following their relegation to Ligue 2. An agreement between the two sides was announced last week and Mara's medical has now been completed and the relevant paperwork finalised. Manager Ralph Hasenh  ttl said:    S  kou is coming here to score goals and has shown in the French league he can do this, now he needs to work hard and show he can do this in the Premier League.    He is a young guy who will need time to adapt to a new country and a new league, but we are excited about his potential and what he can become in the future.    Mara said:    I   m really happy to sign for Southampton and to be a Saint for the next years. Southampton have given me a good opportunity to progress.
