Manchester United have moved into pole position in the race to sign emerging Ecuadorian midfielder Moises Caicedo and are now rumoured to be in    advanced    talks over a deal to bring the 19-year-old to Old Trafford in 2021. Caicedo graduated from the youth ranks at Independiente del Valle in capital city Quito and has started each of Ecuador   s four most recent international games in October and November. United   s interest in Caicedo has already become apparent, but the latest reporting from Ecuador suggests the Old Trafford are better placed than RB Leipzig or AC Milan to secure the signing. West Ham and Ajax have also been mentioned as suitors. A story from Diario Extra, claims that the talks with Independiente del Valle have progressed well and that everything now seems to point to him making the switch to Manchester. The expected fee would be around    4.9m, while it is said that United have offered more than either Leipzig or Milan in an effort to do the deal. Caicedo is considered a box-to-box midfielder and in addition to becoming Ecuador   s youngest ever scorer earlier this year also registered three assists in his four senior international caps to date. Two of those were in the same game against Bolivia and amounted to a match-winning performance. United are no strangers to investing in young talent, having brought in Facundo Pellistri from Penarol in Uruguay in October and pre-arranging a deal for Atalanta winger Amad Diallo that now looks as though it will go through in January after he was granted an Italian passport.
