Inter are open to selling Diego Godin after just one season at the club, amid interest from Ligue 1 giants Lyon. The 34-year-old has failed to have the desired impact at San Siro after joining from Atletico Madrid this summer, even though I Nerazzurri have been title contenders for the majority of the season. The Uruguayan has featured in 25 games in all competitions - 16 of those appearances coming in Serie A - but RMC Sport claimed at the back end of last week that Lyon had approached Inter over a possible deal. That report has now been followed up in Italy by Calciomercato, though they claim that Lyon will not be able to match Godin's hefty wage demands; it's thought that the veteran defender currently earns    5m a year in the fashion capital of the world, plus bonuses. Godin has also been tentatively linked with a reunion with Diego Simeone in Madrid, but it's unlikely Los Rojiblancos will look to rewind the clock and bring him back to Spain. Inter Miami, owned and fronted by David Beckham, are a slightly more glamorous option, with a number of players keen on experiencing MLS before retiring from the game. Regardless of where Godin ends up, it appears that his time at Inter may be coming to a premature end. Antonio Conte is understood to have sanctioned a deal for him last summer because he wanted to add experience to his backline in order to mount a serious Serie A title challenge.
