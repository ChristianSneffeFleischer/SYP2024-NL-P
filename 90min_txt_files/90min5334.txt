Juventus and Barcelona are both keeping an eye on young Ajax midfielder Ryan Gravenberch, who has established himself as a key player for Erik ten Hag's side this season. The highly rated 18-year-old made his senior breakthrough last season and is now a near-permanent fixture of the first team. He has picked up two assists already this season, including one in Saturday's rampant 13-0 win over VVV-Venlo. This is by no means the first time that teams have started to pay attention to Gravenberch, who has been tipped for superstardom for the last few years, but the fact that he is now starring in senior football has only intensified the spotlight on him. According to Tuttosport, Juventus and Barcelona are fighting to get to the front of the queue for his signature, with both identifying Gravenberch as a perfect candidate for their squad rebuilds. Gravenberch has managed 19 appearances for Ten Hag's senior side so far, chipping in with an impressive return of four goals and three assists in all competitions. ?

"He is the new Paul Pogba," Kluivert said (via Goal) when discussing Gravenberch's chances of winning Goal's NxGn prize. "He is very good and very young. He is truly a top player." Gravenberch, who is represented by Mino Raiola, penned a new three-year contract with Ajax back in June, with the Dutch giants clearly in no rush to part ways with perhaps their most exciting young talent.
