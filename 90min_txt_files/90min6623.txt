Confirmation of Timo Werner's transfer to Chelsea is being held up by the practicalities of the striker completing a medical. The 24-year-old had long seemed destined for a move to Liverpool, only for the Blues to swoop in and secure a sensational    60m deal last week. However, according to German football expert Rafa Honigstein, Werner's confirmation as a Chelsea player is being delayed due to the difficulties of organising the player's medical. The former Stuttgart man is unable to fly to the United Kingdom due to the Bundesliga's COVID-19 regulations, while the Blues' own doctors cannot travel to Germany as they would have to self-isolate for 14 days upon their return.  One potential solution would be to use the FA's German doctor, but according to Honigstein Chelsea are more likely to wait until Leipzig's season ends on 27 June or quarantine regulations in the UK are altered. Werner has been in scintillating form this term, netting 25 Bundesliga goals in just 30 games, also impressing in the Champions League for Julian Nagelsmann's side. He represents the second piece of business that Chelsea have completed ahead of next season, with Hakim Ziyech agreeing a move to Stamford Bridge in February. Timo Werner to Chelsea is looking more and more likely, so how could Frank Lampard best utilise the German forward? |        @jamescormack_ Frank Lampard does not appear to be done strengthening his squad either, with Leicester's Ben Chilwell still a key target - though Manchester City are also monitoring the left back's situation closely.
