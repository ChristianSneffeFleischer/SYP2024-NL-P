Leeds have completed the signing of midfielder Tyler Adams on a five-year deal, reuniting him with former RB Leipzig manager Jesse Marsch. United have paid around  £15m for the USMNT star having decided to pursue him instead of Red Bull Salzburg's Mohamed Camara, another former disciple of Marsch's. 23-year-old Adams broke onto the scene at New York Red Bulls before joining Leipzig in 2019. His international debut came in 2017 and he has scored once in 30 appearances so far, helping the USMNT qualify for the 2022 World Cup. Leipzig's statement ended with: "Thanks for everything, Tyler! We wish you all the best for your future and we   ll see each other again!" Adams is Leeds' fifth signing of the summer window following deals for Brenden Aaronson, Darko Gyabi, Rasmus Kristensen and Marc Roca. The Whites will also complete a deal for Feyenoord forward Luis Sinisterra imminently. He is set to become their club-record signing for  £25m, having scored 23 goals in 45 games in all competitions last season.
