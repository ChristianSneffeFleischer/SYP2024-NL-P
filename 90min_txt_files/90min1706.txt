Newcastle have completed the signing of winger Anthony Gordon from Everton. The Magpies have agreed to part with an initial  £40m to sign Gordon, with a further  £5m in add-ons to get the deal over the line. "Since I heard of the interest, I was always convinced Newcastle were for me," said Gordon, who has signed a 'long-term contract' at St James' Park. "I think the fan base and the city really suits me as a person, the way the team are playing under the gaffer at the minute really suits me, and the club just look like they're heading in the right direction. "I feel like it's a really big step. People haven't seen what I'm capable of yet. I think under the gaffer, and the way the club's going, I can really excel here."
