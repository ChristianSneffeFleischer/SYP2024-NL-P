Tottenham Hotspur transfer target Piero Hincapie has signed a new contract with current club Bayer Leverkusen. The 21-year-old has turned into one of the world's most promising defenders since moving to the Bundesliga in 2021 from Talleres. Hincapie starred for Ecuador at the 2022 FIFA World Cup and while he showed his maturity, he gave away a crucial penalty in their decisive group stage loss to Senegal. Nevertheless, 90min learned at the back end of January that Tottenham had enquired about his availability, with Antonio Conte looking to strengthen a fragile backline that slumped to a 4-1 defeat to Leicester on Saturday. But Bayer Leverkusen were unwilling to part ways with Hincapie midway through the season, and placed a    75m valuation on his head that Spurs were unwilling to meet. On this edition of Oh What a Night, part of the 90min podcast network, Sean Walsh & Jude Summerfield discuss record breaker Harry Kane at length after he became Tottenham's record goalscorer.
