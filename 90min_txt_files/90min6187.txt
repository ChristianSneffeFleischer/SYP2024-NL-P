Manchester City are said to have reached an agreement with Valencia regarding the transfer of Ferran Torres, with a breakthrough in talks coming on Wednesday.

With Leroy Sane recently completing his transfer to Bayern Munich, Torres is a name that has been mentioned a number of times as a potential replacement.  The 20-year-old, who has now entered the final year of his contract at Valencia, is already said to have agreed personal terms with Man City ahead of a potential move. Sports journalist Hector Gomez of Golsmedia Sports has now taken to his Twitter to report that the two clubs are now in 'very advanced negotiations' after a breakthrough in talks.  Man City have agreed to pay    25m up front for the Spaniard's services, with a further    10m in add-ons.

Fabrizio Romano has also reported on his Twitter that an agreement is close and advanced talks are taking place between the two clubs.
