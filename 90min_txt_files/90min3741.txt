Carlo Ancelotti has confessed that he does not expect Real Madrid to make any signings  in January, but he did leave the door open to possible departures. Real are plotting an enormous summer transfer window, with Kylian Mbappe, Erling Haaland and Antonio Rudiger all on their radar. Ancelotti revealed that those summer plans are the only discussions going on at the club and January signings are unlikely, although outgoings remain a real possibility. "I don't like January signings much," he said (via Goal). "If we have players who aren't happy, it's something we can think about but we are not going to sign anyone. "We have enough to compete until the end of the season." There are a number of players who are rumoured to be unhappy with life at the Santiago Bernabeu, including midfielder Isco. The Spaniard has tumbled down the pecking order under Ancelotti and is expected to be allowed to walk away for free when his contract expires at the end of the season, but a January exit could be on the cards if any offers come in. Also tipped to leave is striker Luka Jovic, who has managed 71 minutes of La Liga action across six appearances this year. He is well behind Karim Benzema in Ancelotti's eyes and stands to drop even further if at least one of Mbappe or Haaland joins.
