Chelsea have beaten a host of Premier League rivals to secure a transfer for Santos talent Angelo, sources have confirmed to 90min. Chelsea have moved quickly to agree a deal with Santos after engaging in talks at the start of the summer. 90min understands that Liverpool, Newcastle and Nottingham Forest had all expressed an interest in the teenager, but Chelsea have beaten them to the punch. The deal is worth  Â£13m and the player has already agreed personal terms. Barcelona actually have a first option that could be used, but they are set to not exercise their right to match Chelsea's offer. feed The 18-year-old, who is already a regular in the Santos squad with over 120 appearances to his name, is a Brazil international at Under-20 level. He can play across the front-line, but his normal position is as a right-sided forward. It is understood that Angelo will report to Chelsea for pre-season training, at which point it will be decided whether he is loaned out next season, or not. Chelsea have undertaken a process since the Todd Boehly led takeover to not just overhaul the first-team but also bring a glut of the world's best young talent to Stamford Bridge. The deal for Angelo, follows on from similar moves for fellow South Americans Andrey Santos and Kendry Paez, who have both signed for Chelsea this year.
