Arsenal centre-back Gabriel has revealed he feels    at home    at the club, which will come as a relief to fans following recent rumours that Barcelona are interested in the Brazilian. Gabriel, who joined the Gunners from Lille in 2020 in a deal worth up to  Â£27m, had been linked with a switch to Camp Nou by Catalan media as part of a squad revamp that could see both Samuel Umtiti and Clement Lenglet moved out before next season. The 24-year-old   s ability to play on the left side of a centre-back pairing was billed as the main reason why he could be attractive to a Bar  a squad with numerous existing right-footed options. Yet Gabriel has been a critical part of what Mikel Arteta has been building in north London, starting all 27 of the club   s Premier League games since recovering from a knee injury that forced him to miss the whole of August back at the start of the campaign     it is perhaps little coincidence that Arsenal had their worst start to a season in decades when he was unavailable. Despite transfer speculation, the player himself appears fully committed to the club.    In my first season I certainly learnt a lot,    he told Premier League productions.    It   s been a real challenge here and I am more and more settled every day. I feel better and better with each passing game,    he added.    At the same time, we know we all can   t be perfect in every match. We do make mistakes. But I feel good, I feel at home at Arsenal. It   s a great squad to be a part of and together I am sure we can achieve a lot. I am very happy here.
