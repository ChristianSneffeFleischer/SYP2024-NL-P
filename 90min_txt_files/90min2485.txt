Newcastle United have confirmed the signing of goalkeeper Loris Karius on a short-term contract. The Magpies loaned out Martin Dubravka to Manchester United in the summer before losing new number two Karl Darlow to injury, leaving summer signing Nick Pope as their only senior goalkeeper. With the transfer window closed, Newcastle were restricted to free agent signings and quickly settled on former Liverpool stopper Karius, who joins on a three-month contract with an option to extend until the end of the season. "We are pleased to add Loris to our goalkeeping group," said manager Eddie Howe. "He is a very good goalkeeper with Premier League and European experience and he will provide competition and support over an important part of the season." Karius added: "I'm excited. It's a good opportunity for me and a great project to be part of. It didn't take me long to make a decision.
