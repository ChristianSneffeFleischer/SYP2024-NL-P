Liverpool have agreed a deal with RB Leipzig to sign Hungarian midfielder Dominik Szoboszlai, 90min understands. The Reds have been looking to bolster their midfield this summer and wasted little time in recruiting Alexis Mac Allister from Brighton, and now Szoboszlai appears set to follow him through the door. Szoboszlai's contract with Leipzig includes a release clause worth    70m ( Â£60m) which expires at the end of June and sources have confirmed to 90min that, despite initial reluctance to do so, Liverpool have confirmed their intention to trigger that clause. With personal terms also agreed with Szoboszlai, the 22-year-old is now set for a medical with a view to becoming Liverpool's second signing of the summer. Talks over Szoboszlai have been kept separate to those involving Fabio Carvalho, who joined Leipzig on a season-long loan without an option to buy earlier on Friday. feed Szoboszlai enjoyed an excellent campaign for Leipzig last season, racking up ten goals and 13 assists   in all competitions. An attacking midfielder by trade, Szoboszlai spent the majority of the season playing on the wing for Leipzig, with most of his minutes coming on the right side of the team's attack. He is expected to return to a midfield role under Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp, who was previously described by Szoboszlai as the 'best manager in the world'. "I really like Klopp. The way he can inspire his players is unbelievable," Szoboszlai said in 2020. "Even when they have nothing, they can stand up and his players can achieve anything. For me, he is the best manager in the world."
