Wolves left-back Ruben Vinagre has joined Olympiacos on loan for the 2020/21 season, with an option for the Greek side to make the move permanent.  Vinagre joined the club on loan from Monaco ahead of the 2017/18 season, when Nuno Espirito Santo's team romped to the Championship title. The deal was made permanent upon their promotion to the Premier League where he has since served as backup to Jonny Otto.                                                         ,                            ! / Welcome to Olympiacos @Rubenvinagrejr! ?   ?#Olympiacos #Transfer #Welcome #R  benVinagre #WelcomeR  benVinagre #WeKeepOnDreaming pic.twitter.com/wGnXp1msy0 He was pushed down the pecking order by the arrival of Lyon defender Marcal, however, and Saturday's addition of Rayan Ait Nouri from Angers added further competition at left-back. Vinagre has been allowed to leave on loan for the season ahead.  A Wolves statement reads: "Ruben Vinagre has completed a season-long loan to Olympiacos, with an option for the Greek champions to make the move permanent. "Having originally joined on loan from Monaco in 2017, Vinagre played 14 times as Wolves lifted the Championship trophy and netted his first goal in professional football at Burton Albion. Good luck at @olympiacosfc, Ruben!?? "His form convinced the club to make Vinagre   s move a permanent one the following summer and in the Premier League he started in big victories over the likes of Chelsea, Leicester City and Manchester United.
