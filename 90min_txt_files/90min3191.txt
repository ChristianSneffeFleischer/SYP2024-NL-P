Steven Bergwijn is finally closing in on a move to Ajax after the Dutch champions reached an agreement with Tottenham over a long-disputed transfer fee, 90min understands. Ajax have held an interest in the winger for some time and had hoped to sign him back in January, but couldn't finalise a deal with Spurs. But after Ajax agreed to pay a total package worth  £30m -  £26m of which will be paid up front - Bergwijn is set to return to his home country. The 24-year-old was the subject of interest from Everton last week and the Toffees offered him more lucrative terms than Ajax, but he has turned down Frank Lampard's side in favour of a move to Amsterdam. Bergwijn joined Tottenham from PSV Eindhoven back in January 2020, notably scoring a cracking goal on his debut in a 2-0 win over Manchester City. His most memorable moment in a Spurs shirt came in January when he scored twice deep into stoppage time to salvage an unlikely 3-2 win at Leicester.
