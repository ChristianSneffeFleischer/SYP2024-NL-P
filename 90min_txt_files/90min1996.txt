Brighton & Hove Albion have taken up the option to extend Leandro Trossard's contract by 12 months, but his long-term future remains in doubt, 90min understands. The Seagulls have a host of players attracting attention from across Europe after showing brilliant form in the last 12 months. Brighton chief Paul Barber has been quick to insist that Argentine World Cup star Alexis Mac Allister and midfielder Moises Caicedo are not for sale, with both on long-term contracts. The same can't be said of Trossard. 90min understands that Trossard's deal now runs until 2024, but as it stands a new contract is not close to being agreed and Brighton are braced for further interest in the Belgium international. A number of clubs are following Trossard, as 90min revealed last year, with both Chelsea and Newcastle still interested. Magpies sporting director Dan Ashworth, who helped bring Trossard, Mac Allister and Caicedo to Brighton, is keen on a reunion with the trio, and the Belgian looks most likely to rejoin him at this point.
