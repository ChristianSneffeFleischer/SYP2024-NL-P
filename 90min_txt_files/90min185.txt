Jurgen Klopp has admitted he was impressed with new signing Alexis Mac Allister in Liverpool's recent 4-0 win over Leicester City but urged fans to remain patient with the Argentine as he gets used to life at Anfield. A  Â£35m signing from Brighton earlier this summer, Mac Allister has seen plenty of minutes during pre-season and really made an impact during the recent 4-0 victory over Leicester, being singled out by Klopp after the game. "When we found Macca between the lines, he was really good," Klopp told The Athletic. "That helped us speed the game up." Even though he has already been impressed by Mac Allister, Klopp insisted the 24-year-old is not yet at his best and warned fans he will need time to fully learn his place in Liverpool's system. "Good player. These things, it needs time," Klopp said of Mac Allister. "Even in the season it's not that you have the first game and then it's the best game of the season - that would be really horrible if that would be the case. feed "So, we have to work on it and we work on that. We have a lot of options in the areas and the boys need to show up.  "It's not pressure, it's just the situation because I think it was clear when we scored in the first half three goals but second half Cody [Gakpo] and Dom [Szoboszlai] and Luis [Diaz] and Ben [Doak], to be honest, that was pretty special. And Harvey [Elliott] as well really showed up." Liverpool have two more friendlies before their Premier League campaign gets underway, beginning with a huge clash with German giants Bayern Munich on Wednesday. Darmstadt, who were promoted back to the Bundesliga last season, are the final opponents on Monday 7 August, before Liverpool kick off the 2023/24 season with a visit to Stamford Bridge to face Chelsea on the following Sunday.
