Borussia Dortmund have revealed that they have made a fresh contract offer to in-demand striker Youssoufa Moukoko, but have accepted he could walk away from the club. Moukoko is out of contract at the end of the season and is wanted by the likes of Barcelona, Chelsea and Newcastle United. 90min reported last week that Dortmund had made an improved contract offer to the 18-year-old in the hope of convincing him to extend his stay at Signal-Iduna Park. This has now been confirmed by sporting director Sebastian Kehl, who told German outlet kicker: "We have put together a very attractive offer that gives him a lot of room for development. That should lead to a decision. He has to make it with his environment and his advisor. "Youssoufa can now accept this offer and commit to Borussia Dortmund - or we will go our separate ways. I would like him to choose us because he is not yet at the end of his development and I am huge I see potential in him. But there are limits for us as a club. And we have shown these limits. Now it's up to him to confess in a timely manner." Moukoko has scored six goals in 22 games for Dortmund so far this season, while he became the youngest ever player to feature for Germany at a World Cup during this winter's tournament in Qatar.
