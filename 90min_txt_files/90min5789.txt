Wolves have announced the signing of Lyon left-back Marcal, who joins the club on a two-year deal. The 31-year-old Brazilian played in every one of the French side's Champions League knockout games on their run to the semi-finals last season, but now heads to the Premier League where he will join Nuno Espirito Santo's team.  We are delighted to welcome Mar  al as our second addition of the weekend.      ? He becomes their third signing of the summer following goalkeeper Matija Sarkic and Saturday's acquisition of Porto prodigy Fabio Silva, and adds experience and versatility to the backline ahead of another gruelling campaign.
