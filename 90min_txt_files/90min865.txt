Roma have opened talks with West Ham over a deal for their Italian international striker Gianluca Scamacca, sources have confirmed to 90min. I Giallorossi's first-choice striker Tammy Abraham suffered an ACL injury in the final game of the 2022/23 Serie A season, meaning that the ex-Chelsea man will be out of action until the end of the year. As such, Roma have been on the lookout for new attacking option this summer, and they have pinpointed Scamacca as a target.  90min understands Roma have spoken to West Ham about a possible deal for Scamacca, and their sporting director Tiago Pinto is due to arrive in London later this week to finalise talks. feed The 24-year-old joined West Ham last summer in a  Â£35m deal from Sassuolo, but a lack of form and injuries limited him to just 11 Premier League starts and just three league goals. Sources have confirmed to 90min that Scamacca is open to the idea of a move back to Italy and to his hometown of Rome, where he was once a youth player with Roma. West Ham realise they may have to sanction an initial loan for Scamacca but they hope to include a sizeable option to purchase the player in any deal. Roma have moved for Scamacca having finalised their opening deals of the summer in the shape of Houssem Aouar on a free from Lyon and Eintracht Frankfurt defender Evan Ndicka. Midfielder Aouar was announced last week and NDicka is having a medical in Rome ahead of signing a five-year deal at the club.
