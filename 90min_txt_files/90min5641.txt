Manchester United could seal a deal to make Porto left-back Alex Telles their second signing of a frustrating summer by the end of this week. Currently, only midfielder Donny van de Beek has joined the club since Champions League qualification was secured at the end of last season. United have seen direct rivals make shrewd signings but have failed to get a deal for primary target Jadon Sancho over the line. The pursuit of Telles accelerated when United decided against a formal approach for Sergio Reguilon, who has since joined Tottenham. It also seems more opportunistic given that the Brazilian is in the last year of his Porto contract and that a left-back, while wanted, is not as much of a priority.  According to The Guardian, Telles is    hopeful    his move to Old Trafford will be sorted this week. Talks are said to be at an    advanced    stage and the 27-year-old would be expected to earn an estimated  £75,000 per week as a United player. Where things are yet to be wrapped up are in the discussions between the two clubs over the exact transfer fee. Telles has a release clause set at    40m ( £36.7m), although United are reported to be seeking a deal worth a maximum of    25m ( £22.9m) owing to the contract situation. Telles, who first moved to Europe from South America in 2014 to join Galatasaray and has also played for Inter, is known as an attacking full-back. He scored two penalties and assisted a third goal in Porto   s opening Primeira Liga fixture and netted 11 times in the league last season alone.
