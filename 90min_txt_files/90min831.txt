Manchester United and Tottenham are among the teams to have held talks with the representatives of Leeds United centre-back Robin Koch, 90min understands. Koch joined Leeds in the summer of 2020 but is expected to depart the club this summer following their relegation to the Championship, and there are plenty of teams interested in keeping the centre-back in the Premier League. Indeed, sources have confirmed to 90min Man Utd and Tottenham have both spoken with Koch's representatives, while Brentford, Newcastle and Nottingham Forest are also understood to have held exploratory talks. Whether any of those teams will follow up their interest, however, is unclear, with most still drawing up their shortlists and exploring alternative options if they miss out on their top targets. Man Utd, for example, have been focused on landing Napoli's Kim Min-jae but face serious competition from Bayern Munich to sign the South Korea international and may be forced to turn elsewhere. feed Koch is set to leave Leeds this summer although sources close to the Yorkshire side have denied reports that the 26-year-old has a clause in his contract which allows him to depart for free as a result of their relegation.

Leeds are braced for a number of departures following their relegation and, alongside Koch, are expecting to lose American duo Tyler Adams and Brenden Aaronson. Like Koch, Adams has plenty of interest in the Premier League, with a number of heavyweights known admirers of the midfielder. Man Utd, Newcastle and Tottenham are all keen as well, while there is also interest from Liverpool.
