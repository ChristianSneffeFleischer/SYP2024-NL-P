Arsenal have confirmed that midfielder Dani Ceballos has re-joined the club on loan for the 2020/21 season after a successful spell in north London last term. The Spaniard played an increasingly important role for the Gunners as the 2019/20 season progressed, particularly following the appointment of Mikel Arteta as head coach. Ceballos made 37 appearances in all competitions last campaign, managing two goals and two assists in the process.  ? Dani Ceballos has rejoined us for a second successive season-long loan from Real Madrid! Arsenal were keen to keep hold of the 24-year-old for another season, and they have now confirmed on their official website that Ceballos will spend the 2020/21 campaign at the Emirates. Mikel Arteta is quotes as saying:    Dani was an  integral part of our team last season and finished the season in excellent form. I love Dani   s passion and commitment and he   s a highly skilful player.  "We   re all delighted to welcome him back and we look forward to seeing him pick up where he left off.    Ceballos is expected to have to self-isolate for 14 days once he returns to London. The Athletic report that the Gunners will not pay a loan fee this time for the midfielder as they will be covering his full wages. Last, season, however, they part-funded his salary and, as a result, were made to pay a loan fee.  This will come as a major boost for Arteta, who has made no secret of his desire to keep hold of the player for at least another season. A number of clubs such as Real Betis and Milan were keen on bringing Ceballos in this summer, but he had his heart set on a return to Arsenal and nowhere else.
