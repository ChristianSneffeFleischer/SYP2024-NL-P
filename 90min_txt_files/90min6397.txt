The agent of young goalkeeper Fabian Mrozek has confirmed that the player has signed for Liverpool, and will initially join the Reds' youth setup.  The tall 16-year-old joined FC Wroclaw's Under-19 side back in January 2017, and has gone on to build up his reputation around Europe. Mrozek, who has already been called up to play for Poland's Under-15 and Under-16 sides, has attracted interest from a number of clubs, but it appears as though Liverpool have won the race.

Schlage further notes that the teenage goalkeeper will join the Reds' youth setup, but could also train with the first team.  In fact, the Express report that he is expected to start training with the first team 'soon'. The report further adds that Mrozek had a trial with the Reds back in September of 2019, and he took his chance as he impressed the coaches at the club's academy with his skills. The coaching staff were keen to bring him to Anfield, but the Reds were forced to wait until he turned 16. It was first reported way back in September that an agreement was already in place - but the transfer has seemingly now finally been completed.
