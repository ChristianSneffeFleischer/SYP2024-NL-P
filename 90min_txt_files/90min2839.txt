Wolves are close to completing the signing of Valencia winger Goncalo Guedes, 90min can confirm. Valencia boss Gennaro Gattuso recently revealed that the club had received a 'huge offer' from a Premier League side for Guedes, who has been permitted to leave the club after entering the final two years of his contract. It has since emerged that it is Wolves who are pursuing a deal for Guedes and sources have confirmed to 90min that a deal to bring the 25-year-old Portugal international to Wolves is close to completion. A fee of around  Â£27m has been agreed between the two clubs and Guedes is now set to fly to England to undergo a medical and put pen to paper on a long-term contract. Should all go to plan, Guedes will become Wolves' second signing of the summer following the arrival of centre-back Nathan Collins.
