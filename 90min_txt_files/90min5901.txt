Frank Lampard has wasted no time at all in addressing Chelsea   s problems from last season. Lampard   s side leaked goals throughout the 2019/20 campaign, conceding no fewer than 54 in 38 league games     more than 14th placed Crystal Palace     and the Blues boss    summer transfer activity suggests he   s well aware of their need to shore up the backline. The signings of Timo Werner and Hakim Ziyech are also quality additions at the top end of the field, with the Chelsea keen to bridge the enormous 33-point gap between themselves and Premier League champions Liverpool. Blue is definitely the colour! ?@TSilva3 #OhhThiagoSilva pic.twitter.com/bRc4nOcb1I With five new faces through the Stamford Bridge door already this summer, 90min takes a look at each of the club   s summer signings and assesses which will prove to be the best piece of business. While Ben Chilwell certainly represents an upgrade on Chelsea   s current crop of left-backs, the Blues paid well over the odds for the England international (though in fairness, no England player under the age of 35 has ever been bought for reasonable money).The former Leicester man should fit into Lampard   s system seamlessly, however his defensive nous is still up for debate.At  Â£50m there   s far better options out there, and the club may come to rue not looking further afield in a bid to solve their left-back problems.  Chelsea have already confirmed Malang Sarr will spend next season out on loan - you know, just to give him a real taste of life as a youngster at Chelsea.Sarr arrives on a free transfer from French side Nice, and he could prove to be a quality transfer in years to come.Despite being just 21 years old, the France Under-21 international already has two seasons as an ever-present in Ligue 1 under his belt, and is widely expected to enjoy a stellar career at the top.Admittedly, having potential and becoming a great player don't always go hand in hand, though with the right coaching the former Nice man could prove to be a star. At the polar opposite end of the scale to Sarr is Thiago Silva.The former Paris Saint-Germain defender arrives fresh from his Champions League heartbreak at the hands of Bayern Munich, though the experience he'll bring could be invaluable.While Chelsea will be hoping the Brazilian can have an instant impact on the field, the knowledge he can pass on to the likes of Kurt Zouma and Andreas Christensen could prove as valuable as his performances on the pitch.The Blues needed to address their problems in defence, and although he may be past his absolute best, the free signing of a man with 89 caps for Brazil is quality business.
