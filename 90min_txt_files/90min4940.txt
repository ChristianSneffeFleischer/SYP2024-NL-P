Barcelona could complete the signing of Manchester City defender Eric Garcia before the end of the January transfer window as a result of the Premier League side lowering their valuation. It has long been a question of when rather than if Garcia would return to his former club, having traded La Masia for the Etihad Campus as a 16-year-old in 2017. Now 20, he has become part of the first-team squad at City but has refused to sign a new contract and will be leaving Manchester one way or another by the end of the season at the latest. City   s demands of up to    20m last summer priced Bar  a out of a deal amid severe financial strain at Camp Nou. But the Premier League side are well aware that they stand to lose Garcia on a free transfer unless they are willing to agree to a more affordable deal this month. Barcelona are already permitted to formally negotiate and agree a contract with Garcia because he has entered the final six months of his City deal. At the very least, the Catalans can secure his signature on a pre-contract agreement for the summer. Whether a transfer can go ahead this month will depend on talks between the clubs. Mundo Deportivo claims City   s demands have halved since last summer. Instead of asking for a    10m fixed price and up to    10m in add-ons, it is said the Premier League side now value Garcia at    5m plus another    5m, or up to    10m in total. MD also claims that Bar  a wouldn   t even have to pay the initial    5m up front and could defer the payment until next season, which would be a significant boost to the club   s accounts because of the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on revenue streams. Despite coach Ronald Koeman recently stating his desire to bring in a 'number nine', another centre-back has to be a priority for Bar  a if they can only commit to one signing.
