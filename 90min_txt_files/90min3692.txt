Ferran Torres could inherit Barcelona   s number 19 shirt vacated by Sergio Aguero once an impending January transfer from Manchester City worth up to    65m is fully complete. Operating as a makeshift    number nine    in Manchester until injury ruled him out of action in October, Torres had effectively replaced Aguero at City and will now do so again at Camp Nou. The veteran striker announced his premature retirement last week at the age of 33 as a result of a cardiac arrhythmia first detected in early November.

La Liga rules dictate that all first-team players must wear a shirt numbered 1-25. Dani Alves has recently acquired the number eight shirt on his return to Bar  a, which leaves Aguero   s former 19 shirt one of only two options for Torres unless others depart in January. Number 25 is also free and would typically be worn by a goalkeeper as per the aforementioned La Liga rules, although current third choice stopper Inaki Pena splits his time with Barcelona B and therefore still wears 26 as a registered non-first-team number.
