Bayern Munich are not interested in signing Cristiano Ronaldo from Manchester United, sources have confirmed to 90min. Ronaldo is almost certain to depart Old Trafford in January following an explosive interview with Piers Morgan - due to be broadcast in full on Wednesday and Thursday night - in which he has openly criticised United's owners, manager and structure. Ronaldo himself is now away on World Cup duty with Portugal, but his agents, led by the renowned Jorge Mendes, are talking to potential suitors. The likes of Chelsea, Paris Saint Germain and Sporting are again being linked with the 37-year-old - like they were throughout the summer - while Bayern were another team who previously assessed Ronaldo's situation, as he agitated for a move away from Old Trafford.
