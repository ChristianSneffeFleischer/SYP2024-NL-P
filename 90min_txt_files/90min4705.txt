Borussia Monchengladbach's Jonas Hofmann has said several clubs may have 'shown an interest' in him, amid reports linking the midfielder with Chelsea.  The 28-year-old has been something of a late bloomer. Starting his senior career at Borussia Dortmund - where he worked under current Blues boss Thomas Tuchel - he struggled to break into the first team and was eventually sold to Gladbach in 2016. After several solid seasons, he is enjoying his best ever campaign this time out, netting five goals and laying on nine assists in 17 Bundesliga matches so far. He has also featured four times in the Champions League.  After reports linked him with a reunion with Tuchel in west London, Hofmann was asked about the possibility of him leaving Die Folen in the summer.  "Basically, I feel good at Borussia, I've always emphasised that," told  Ruhr Nachrichten, via Sports Witness. "It may be that one or the other club has expressed its interest. Nevertheless, for me, the absolute focus is on having a successful season with Borussia and dedicating myself fully to success. I put my personal situation under it." 20/21 9     £   19/20 3     £18/19 5     £17/18 5     £16/17 1     £15/16 2     £14/15 0     £13/14 6     £12/13 1     £Jonas Hofmann has set a new personal best for assists this season ? pic.twitter.com/0tNPXK9eTT Later on in the same interview, he was directly asked about the possibility of him joining Chelsea, to which he responded: "I think it's clear that other clubs will notice you if you perform well. Therefore, it is possible that one or the other has already asked."
