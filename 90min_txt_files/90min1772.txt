AFC Bournemouth have agreed a deal with Villarreal for attacker Nicolas Jackson, sources have confirmed to 90min. Southampton had been in talks for the 21-year-old Senegal international, but the move stalled and Bournemouth moved quickly to agree terms of their own. Jackson is is now due for his medical at the Vitality Stadium and is expected to be confirmed as Bournemouth's latest signing on Wednesday. The Jackson deal, which is worth  £21m with options possibly taking it close to  £25m, is Bournemouth's second signing of the January transfer window following quickly on from the addition of Lorient winger Dango Ouattara. Bournemouth boss Gary O'Neil admits the club are working hard to add more signings to the squad.
