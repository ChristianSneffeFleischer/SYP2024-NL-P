Leeds United are ready to battle it out with Europe's giants for the signature of Ajax left-back Nicolas Tagliafico after the defender reached a 'gentleman's agreement' to leave his club this summer. The 28-year-old has long been linked with a move away from the Dutch club, with England and Spain's league leaders Manchester City and Atletico Madrid having both shown some interest in the past. But AS reports that it is Premier League newcomers Leeds who are leading the chase to sign Tagliafico this summer, although Italian outfit Inter are hot on their heels. A fee of around  Â£13m is believed to be enough to secure his services.  It is certainly an ambitious move from the Whites, who are hoping to fend off several of Europe's most powerful teams to land the Ajax star. His arrival would be much-needed to bolster the squad, given that current full-back Gianni Alioski's contract is set to expire at the end of the season.  They will be hopeful that the Argentinian connection between the left-back and boss Marcelo Bielsa could convince Tagliafico to choose Elland Road over their rivals, as he is revered for his coaching skills back in South America.  The Argentine also possesses an Italian passport, which means he should have no problem in gaining access to play in the Premier League.
