West Ham United have finalised the signing of midfielder Edson Alvarez from Ajax. The Hammers have been exploring how to spend the  £105m earned by Declan Rice's sale to Arsenal and have begun their shopping spree with a move for Alvarez, who 90min understands will set West Ham back around  £34m if all add-ons are met. Alvarez, 25, has signed a five-year contract at London Stadium to become West Ham's first addition of the summer. "I am very happy and very proud to be here," Alvarez told club media. "Being here in London and seeing London Stadium, it   s amazing. I can   t wait to play here in front of the West Ham fans. "It   s a hugely sentimental moment for me in my career. To join a club like a West Ham is a dream for me and my family.  "The Premier League is a special league, the best league in the world and I think my style will suit it. I now have a responsibility to West Ham and the West Ham family and I will give absolutely everything for the shirt." feed Manager David Moyes added: "We   re really pleased to add Edson to our squad. The midfield area was one we were especially keen to strengthen this summer     and Edson will complement the other options we have in that department. "He   s an experienced international player, who has enjoyed great success for both club and country during his career to date." "We   re excited about welcoming to West Ham and seeing him play his part in English and European competition for the Club." West Ham's spending may just be getting started after bids of  £30m for both Southampton's James Ward-Prowse and Manchester United's Harry Maguire were accepted.
