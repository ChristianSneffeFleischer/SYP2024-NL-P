Returning Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti has been informed that the club are only capable of making one big name signing this summer. Real's finances have taken a hit due to the coronavirus pandemic, and club president Florentino Perez has milked this excuse extensively when justifying plans to breakaway and form the universally unpopular European Super League. The club are also carrying out extensive renovations at the Santiago Bernabeu, and Marca report that there is little money to spend in the transfer window. Real have continually been linked with Paris Saint-Germain forward Kylian Mbappe and Borussia Dortmund striker Erling Haaland, but Los Blancos are likely to only sign a maximum of one of those targets in the coming months. While Real have looked lost at the top end of the pitch and their pursuits of Mbappe and Haaland are justified, they are also in desperate need of defensive reinforcements. Club legend Sergio Ramos has already announced that he will be leaving the club on a free transfer, while France centre-back Raphael Varane continues to be heavily linked with a move away, with a move to Manchester United looking like a real possibility. Bayern Munich defender David Alaba has already signed on a free deal and will join up with his new teammates in Madrid later this summer, and Real are one of a number of clubs lining up to sign Sevilla's Jules Kounde.
