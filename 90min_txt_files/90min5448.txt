Leicester City winger Demarai Gray was never likely to leave the club despite being linked with a move away for much of the summer.  The 24-year-old was the subject of reported interest from Tottenham and Premier League newcomers Leeds United during the transfer window, but no concrete offers materialised.  Rumours surrounding his future intensified after the Birmingham City academy graduate was once again left out of the Foxes matchday squad by Brendan Rodgers, when the Northern Irishman's side suffered a shock 3-0 defeat at home to West Ham.  But Gray isn't completely out of his manager's thinking, despite not featuring in the top-flight so far this season, with Rodgers confirming after the game:    He   s just outside of the squad. He   s training and we haven   t had any interest in Demarai. Speaking about Gray after Sunday   s 3-0 defeat at the King Power Stadium to the Hammers, Rodgers said (quoted by FourFourTwo):    He   s just outside of the squad. He   s training and we haven   t had any interest in Demarai.    He   s working hard to get back into the squad again. The squad has started the season well, so that   s been difficult for him. So he   s very much in the squad and unless something changes on Monday he   ll continue with his work here at Leicester.
