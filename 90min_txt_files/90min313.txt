Crystal Palace midfielder Cheick Doucoure is the subject of interest from top clubs around Europe, including Liverpool, Paris Saint-Germain and Atletico Madrid, sources have confirmed to 90min. The Mali international joined the Eagles from Lens last summer and impressed during his debut season in south London, scooping the club's Player of the Year award ahead of the likes of Wilfried Zaha, Eberechi Eze and Michael Olise. Doucoure's antics have not gone unnoticed and a number of sides have made enquiries to Crystal Palace, but 90min understands they do not intend to let the midfielder go cheaply. In fact, Palace chairman Steve Parish will demand a fee of at least  Â£65m to even consider letting Doucoure leave Selhurst Park. Palace are aware that Liverpool are interested in the 23-year-old, with the Reds on the verge of losing Fabinho and club captain Jordan Henderson to the Saudi Pro League. feed Liverpool have already added Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai to their ranks this summer, but the sudden departures of an experienced duo in Fabinho and Henderson means they are on the hunt for another midfielder. Sources have also told 90min that Atletico Madrid and PSG have held discussions with Doucoure's representatives regarding a move. Atletico have been lost Geoffrey Kondogbia to Marseille this transfer window and have been linked with Tottenham's Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, while PSG are in the midst of a rebuild following Lionel Messi's exit to Inter Miami and with Kylian Mbappe's future increasingly uncertain.
