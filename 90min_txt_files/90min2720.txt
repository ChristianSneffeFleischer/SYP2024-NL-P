Crystal Palace have been in contact with Manchester United over a potential deal that could see Aaron Wan-Bissaka return to Selhurst Park three years after leaving south London for Old Trafford. Wan-Bissaka was a near permanent fixture of the United lineup in his first two seasons with the club, making 100 appearances across all competitions during that time. But the Croydon-born defender suffered a loss in form in the early months of 2021/22 and was later dropped in favour of Diogo Dalot, whose own United career was subsequently resurrected. Wan-Bissaka has remained benched under new manager Erik ten Hag and with Dalot already head of him in the pecking order, the club is also in the market for another right-back. Barcelona   s Sergino Dest and Celtic   s Josip Juranovic are top of the list of targets, although Thomas Meunier of Borussia Dortmund has also been linked. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  &  Toby Cudworth  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Erik ten Hag wanting to sign five players before the transfer window closes, and Man Utd's attitude to selling Cristiano Ronaldo.
