Real Madrid have been tipped to ask for at least    20m ( £17.9m) for left-back Sergio Reguilon, who spent the 2019/20 season on loan with Sevilla and won the Europa League. Having made the step up from Real Madrid Castilla two years ago, Reguilon was a bit-part player with the first-team in 2018/19 and left last summer in search of greater opportunities. The 23-year-old found that at Sevilla, playing 38 times in all competitions, including every minute of the Europa League finals mini-tournament in Germany earlier this month. The latter performances in particular have done wonders for his reputation as he reaches a career crossroad. Despite his impressive form, Reguilon doesn   t appear likely to have an immediate future back at his parent club, where Marcelo and Ferland Mendy have locked down the left-back places. Marca writes that former Real coach Julen Lopetegui wants to keep Reguilon at Sevilla, but there are other clubs who rival that interest. Serie A giants Juventus and Inter are named as keeping an eye on things, as are Premier League duo Manchester United and Tottenham. It is said that Real   s upper price comes in at    25m ( £22.4m). Inter have already done business with Madrid over one defender so far this summer, having signed Achraf Hakimi from Los Blancos in early July for around    40m. Full-back is one of the five positions that Manchester United ultimately want to strengthen, with Luke Shaw and Aaron Wan-Bissaka starters on the left and right respectively and Brandon Williams the first alternative in both positions. Their top target, however, remains Jadon Sancho.
