Contract talks between Crystal Palace and defender Patrick van Aanholt have stalled, with the left-back likely to leave the club in the summer.  Roy Hodgson's side opened negotiations back in September, but the Dutch international has so far been unable to agree terms over extending his deal.  According to Football Insider, talks over a new contract have broken down and are facing collapse, meaning the 30-year-old would be free to leave south London for nothing next summer when his current deal expires.  The left-back came through the ranks at Eredivisie giants PSV Eindhoven before making the switch to Chelsea in 2009.  He failed to break into the first team at Stamford Bridge and embarked upon a series of loan spells including time at Newcastle, Leicester, Wigan and Vitesse Arnhem before making a permanent move to Sunderland for  £1.7m in the summer of 2014.  It was there was Van Aanholt established himself as a Premier League regular, impressing at the Stadium of Light despite the Black Cats' continued troubles on the pitch.  Two and a half years later, Palace secured his services for  £9.5m, and the marauding full-back has gone on to make 114 appearances for the Eagles, scoring 14 goals and providing five assists.  After missing the start of the new campaign due to a dislocated shoulder, Van Aanholt has started Palace's last two top-flight fixtures and earned his ninth international cap in the Netherland's 2-1 win over Poland last time out.  His impressive displays for club and country have attracted admiring glances from other clubs hoping to secure a free transfer when his contract expires in seven months time. One elite club is said to be interested in agreeing a pre-contract deal as early as January.
