Bayern Munich midfielder Joshua Kimmich has played down suggestions he could leave the club this summer. Manchester City and Barcelona have both registered their interest in Kimmich, who 90min understands is considering his future at the Allianz Arena as he enters the final two years of his contract. Bayern remain adamant that they will not sell Kimmich and the 28-year-old has now moved to try and cool the uncertainty surrounding his future. "It was difficult not to come across it [the rumours]," Kimmich told Bild. "Generally, I'm not too invested in the rumours. "I still have, as everyone knows, two years left on my contract and we have big plans [for those two years] at Bayern." feed Bayern, who have already confirmed the arrival of Konrad Laimer on a free transfer, had been interested in a move for West Ham midfielder Declan Rice but appear to have accepted defeat in the expensive race for his signature. Arsenal have made a breakthrough in negotiations with West Ham, signalling a willingness to meet their  Â£100m price tag and pushing ahead with their plan to sign the England international. There are still expected to be plenty of midfielders on the move this summer, with both Barcelona and City known to be keen to bolster in that area of the field. Barcelona need a new defensive midfielder to replace the departing Sergio Busquets, while City are expected to strike a deal to lure Mateo Kovacic away from Chelsea.
