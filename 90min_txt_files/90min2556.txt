Manchester United winger Amad Diallo has joined Sunderland on loan for the rest of the season. Amad joined United from Atalanta in 2021 in a deal worth up to  Â£38m in January, but the 20-year-old Ivory Coast international has so far struggled to make a permanent first-team place. After nine senior appearances and one goal for his parent club, Amad made the loan switch to Rangers in January and played 10 times in the Scottish Premiership, scoring three times. Birmingham and Derby both showed interest in him at that time. Now, he becomes the latest United youngster to move to the Championship this summer after Hannibal Mejbri joined Birmingham, Ethan Laird went to QPR and Alvaro Fernandez to Preston. Sunderland have returned to the second tier this season after four years in League One.    I feel good and very positive about this opportunity, so I   m happy to be here,    Amad told the Black Cats    official website upon his arrival on Wearside.    It was a great experience to play with Manchester United, but I   m here for a new challenge and I want to try my best to bring a lot of success to the club.
