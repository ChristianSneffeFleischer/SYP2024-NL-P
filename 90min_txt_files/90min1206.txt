Independiente del Valle general manager Santiago Morales has confirmed Chelsea have agreed to sign 15-year-old Kendry Paez. Paez, seen as one of South America's most exciting young players, is set to join Chelsea in 2025 in a deal which 90min understands could be worth up to    20m if all bonuses are triggered.    It is something that we have already been talking about on a few occasions, a few months ago. There is a specific interest from  Chelsea, it is practically arranged between the parties," Morales told Studio Futbol on Paez's future.    Legally we are looking at what can be done, he is a 15-year-old boy,  FIFA  prohibits this type of negotiation.    We are going to be fortunate enough to be able to enjoy him for at least two more years until he turns 18 and then he can go.    feed Paez, who bagged three goals and five assists in eight games at April's Under-17 South American Championships, is just 15 years of age and will not turn 18 until May 4, 2025. Since 2001, FIFA have prohibited players under 18 from transferring internationally, which is why Real Madrid are also waiting to sign 16-year-old striker Endrick from Brazilian side Palmeiras, with a    70m deal already signed. English clubs used to be able to sign young players from inside the European Union, but Brexit now means those players also must be 18 before making the move, forcing the likes of Chelsea to pursue homegrown talents instead.
