Matt Doherty is set to return to the Premier League this summer after an unsuccessful spell at Atletico Madrid, 90min understands. The Republic of Ireland international joined Atletico Madrid on January transfer deadline day, signing a six-month contract at the Civitas Metropolitan Stadium after his contract at Tottenham was mutually terminated. Doherty was initially supposed to join Atleti on loan until the end of the season, but due to Tottenham already having too many players out on loan they were forced to terminate the wing-back's contract in order to sanction the move. Since making the move, Doherty has very, very rarely featured for Diego Simeone's side. To date, the 31-year-old has played just 12 minutes of competitive football in one substitute's appearance.

Sources have confirmed that Crystal Palace, his ex-employers' Wolves, Burnley and Sheffield United are all interested in signing Doherty as a free agent this summer. Doherty has previously spent 10 years on the books at Wolves, becoming one of the league's premier wing-backs for a short period at the tail end of his time at Molineux before joining Tottenham for a reported  Â£13.5m in 2020.
