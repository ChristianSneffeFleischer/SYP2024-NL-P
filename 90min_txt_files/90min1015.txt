Igor Tudor's departure from Marseille has alerted Juventus over his availability to take over from Massimiliano Allegri, 90min understands.  Tudor announced his departure from OM during a press conference on Friday ahead of the club's final game of the Ligue 1 season.     It was an honor to work for the club, for this family with supporters of the kind you so rarely find. On a personal level, I have grown. I leave the club in a better position than thee one I found it in," he said.    A season here is worth two or three seasons in another club." Sources have confirmed to 90min that his departure has caught the attention of Juventus, who are due to decide the future of their current manager Allgri in the coming days.  feed Meetings are set to take place between La Vecchia Signora and Allegri following the club's final Serie A game of the season against Udinese at the Dacia Arena.  90min recently reported that the CEO of Juventus' parent company John Elkann was 'running out of patience' with Allegri following a string of disappointing results which saw them lose in both the Coppa Italia and Europa League semi-finals. If Tudor does indeed replace Allegri at Juve, he would be returning to the club where he spent nine successful years during his playing days. The Croatian won the Serie A on multiple occasions while in Turin and was also part of Andrea Pirlo's coaching staff when they lifted the Coppa Italia in 2021.
