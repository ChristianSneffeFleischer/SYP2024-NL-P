The 2021 January transfer window has finally closed, and it was quite the low-key affair, wasn't it?

Arsenal and Manchester United in particular were most active, but their priority was outgoings, with a number of peripheral players departing. Here's a roundup of all the deals that took place involving Premier League clubs.
