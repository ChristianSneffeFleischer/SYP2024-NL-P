West Ham are closing in on the loan signing of Spartak Moscow midfielder Alex Kral. The 23-year-old has been on the club's radar for a number of months, but talk of a move to the London Stadium had gone quiet after Kral's performances for the Czech Republic at Euro 2020. But David Moyes has been forceful in his attempts to strengthen his squad, with West Ham about to participate in the Europa League after securing a surprise sixth-place Premier League finish last season. Kurt Zouma has arrived on a four-year deal within the last 48 hours, while a deal worth up to    30m for Nikola Vlasic has also been concluded. He's joined the Hammers from CSKA Moscow, signing a six-year contract. 90min understands that Kral could now be joining them in London, with a loan deal that includes an option to buy close to being finalised. A combative central midfielder, he'll provide competition and cover for the likes of Declan Rice and fellow countryman Tomas Soucek in midfield, increasing the club's squad depth ahead of a punishing run of fixtures. Kral may not be the only incoming before the transfer deadline slams shut. West Ham have made enquiries about a number of Premier League players, with a few more loan deals being targeted.
