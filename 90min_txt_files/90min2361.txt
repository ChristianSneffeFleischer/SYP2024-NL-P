Real Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester City have dispatched scouts and intermediaries to take a closer look at the progress of Napoli superstar Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, 90min understands. The Georgia international has been one of the form players in Europe since making his move to Naples in the summer and is one of the key reasons behind their excellent start to the new season. Kvaratskhelia was snapped up by Napoli in the summer from Dinamo Batumi, who he was with having been allowed to leave Rubin Kazan earlier in the year after his contract was suspended due to Russia   s invasion of Ukraine. The 21-year-old has settled seamlessly into life in Serie A and has made his  Â£10m price-tag look and absolute bargain. Kvaratskhelia is already being linked with a possible big-money move in 2023, but sources have told 90min that both he and Napoli are not contemplating a transfer in the next 12 months. The forward could very well be offered a new deal on the back of this form, and both parties are keen to talk - possibly as soon as the upcoming World Cup window. In a recent interview in his homeland, he revealed his delight at being at Napoli, but there were interesting tidbits which would have alerted Real Madrid and Man City. Kvaratskhelia, who admitted that City legend Georgi Kinkladze was his hero growing up, added that he is a Real fan, though insists that he has already fulfilled his dream of playing for a big club.
