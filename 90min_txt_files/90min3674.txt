Central midfielder Sean Davis has signed with Nashville SC via free agency, according to reports. Davis recently left the New York Red Bulls after six years, 208 appearances, and two Supporters' Shield titles having failed to agree a new contract with the club. The Red Bulls officially announced the departure of their club captain on Thursday via their social media channels. Thank you, Sean. It's been our honor watching you grow within our organization. Best of luck in what's next, @seanakiradavis. pic.twitter.com/OXh9rSLLbw According to MLSsoccer.com's Tom Bogert, Davis already has a move to Nashville lined up ahead of the 2022 MLS season. Should the report be true, Nashville will be adding one of the most valuable free agents on the MLS market this winter. Davis would slot into Gary Smith's midfield alongside Dax McCarty and Anibal Godoy in what would arguably be the most experienced trio in the league.  Davis, 28, is best known for his relentless work rate and defensive capabilities. The three-time USMNT midfielder made more tackles (146) than any other player in MLS in 2021, while he ranked first among Red Bulls players for pressures (683), interceptions (95), and recoveries (480). Davis also completed more passes (1,214) and progressive passes (190) for the Red Bulls and will offer Nashville extra ball security in midfield. Nashville - who are switching to the Western Conference for the 2022 campaign following the arrival of Charlotte FC - have been a huge success in MLS so far, making the Playoffs in each of their first two campaigns. Davis was 1st in MLS for tackles in 2021 and 1st among #RBNY players for pressures, interceptions and recoveries#EveryoneN are getting themselves a defensive monster.
