Brentford striker Ollie Watkins is being closely monitored by Premier League sides Southampton and Crystal Palace ahead of a potential transfer in the upcoming window. Watkins, who is the joint top scorer in this season's Championship with 23 goals, has been pivotal in Brentford's push for the Premier League, with the Bees sitting third in the league - five points off an automatic promotion place. The 24-year-old's prolific form has reportedly caught the eye of a number of Premier League teams, with West Ham reportedly interested in the striker back in March and even Chelsea linked earlier in the year.  Now The Athletic report that Southampton and Crystal Palace are both interested in Watkins. Crystal Palace's Roy Hodgson recently announced his plans to strengthen the Eagles' attack by dipping into the transfer market and Watkins could be the answer to the lack of goals at Selhurst Park this season. With Jordan Ayew's nine goals the most at Palace this season, the addition of a highly rated goalscorer like Watkins could be a boost for the Eagles.  Southampton are likely looking for someone to partner with the free scoring Danny Ings, who has been in sensational form for the Saints this season. Watkins joined Brentford back in 2017 for  £1.8m from Exeter City and the forward has gone from strength to strength during his time at Griffin Park, scoring 46 goals over his three years at the club.
