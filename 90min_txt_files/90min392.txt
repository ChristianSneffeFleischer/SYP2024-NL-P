Manchester United have turned down an initial offer from Turkish side Galatasaray for midfielder Fred, 90min understands. Fred has fallen down the pecking order at Old Trafford and is understood to be considering his options, with United prepared to cash in on the 30-year-old Brazilian for the right price. United are seeking over  Â£20m to part ways with Fred and 90min understands an opening proposal from Galatasaray has been rejected after falling short of that valuation. There remains plenty of interest in Fred's services but United's asking price could prove problematic. Fulham have targeted the midfielder but have made it clear that they do not share United's value of Fred. The Cottagers also have other targets in mind, including another Brazilian, 21-year-old Andre Trindade of Fluminense. feed Nottingham Forest have made contact with Fred's representatives but have not advanced their interest at this point. Roma have also reached out. The most concrete interest in Fred's services currently comes from Saudi Arabia but the midfielder is not believed to have made a decision on whether to leave United or not this summer. Fred managed 56 appearances in all competitions last season - only Bruno Fernandes and David de Gea featured in more games - but only 23 of those came as a starter. The summer arrival of Mason Mount from Chelsea has only added to the competition for minutes in Erik ten Hag's midfield, forcing Fred to consider his options.
