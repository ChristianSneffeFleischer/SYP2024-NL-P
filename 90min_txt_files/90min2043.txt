Southampton are pursuing a January deal to sign Lorient striker Terem Moffi, 90min understands. The Saints tumbled to the bottom of the Premier League following their 3-1 loss to Brighton and have scored just 14 goals in 16 games - only West Ham, Everton, Nottingham Forest and Wolves have a poorer return in front of goal this season. Finding a reliable source of goals is among new manager Nathan Jones' top priorities for the January window and sources have confirmed to 90min that Southampton have taken a liking to 23-year-old Moffi. The Lorient striker sits tied for third in Ligue 1's scoring charts, having netted ten goals in 14 appearances during the 2022/23 campaign. A number of sides have watched Moffi in action and there is plenty of interest in his services, but 90min understands that Southampton are looking to get a deal done quickly. Moffi is currently enjoying his most successful season in France and has been a vital part of Lorient's surprise impact at the top of Ligue 1. They were as high as second in October before a run of five games without a win saw them drop to seventh.
