Alexander Nubel has confirmed that he does not plan to return to Bayern Munich early to replace the injured Manuel Neuer. Neuer broke his leg on a skiing holiday following the World Cup and has been ruled out for the remainder of the season, prompting Bayern to try and bring Nubel back from his loan with Monaco to fill the void. The club have long seen Nubel as the long-term successor for Neuer but the 26-year-old has already clarified that he does not plan to return to Bayern at the end of the season if he is to be used as a second-choice stopper. Even with the promise of six months of regular action while Neuer recovers, Nubel has made it clear that he does not want to come back. "It makes little sense for me to come back," Nubel told Bild. "I don't know how serious Manuel's injury is, but I think he will be fit again by summer, at the latest in preparation for next season."
