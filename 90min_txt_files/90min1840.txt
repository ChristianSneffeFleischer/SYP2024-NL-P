Jhon Duran has expressed his gratitude for the Chicago Fire following his dream move to Aston Villa. The West Midlands club revealed last week that they'd reached an agreement for the Colombian teenager, paying an initial $18m fee that could rise to $22m - as reported by 90min. Duran spent just one season with the Chicago Fire after joining from Envigado in his homeland for $2.5m. But it was certainly a productive campaign, with the striker scoring eight goals and providing six assists in 28 appearances across all competitions, including five goals in his last five MLS regular season outings. That was enough to convince Premier League giants Villa to spend big, with the fee a Chicago Fire club record for an outgoing player. Duran is understandably thankful for the launchpad the club have provided for his career. On this edition of Talking Transfers, Scott Saunders hosts Toby Cudworth & Graeme Bailey to discuss all the big transfer stories. This week's agenda includes Jude Bellingham, Harry Kane, Declan Rice, Hakim Ziyech, Leandro Trossard, Pedro Porro, Mykhaylo Mudryk and more!

I   m grateful to my teammates, coaches, Club staff, and the fans for all the support I received this past year. The Fire and the city of Chicago will always have a special place in my heart.    Fire sporting director George Heitz believes this is just the next step for Duran in a career path that will see him become one of the world's best.
