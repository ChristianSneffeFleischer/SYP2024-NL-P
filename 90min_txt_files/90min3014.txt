Tottenham are hoping to sign another right wing-back before the end of the transfer window, 90min understands. Antonio Conte has already added Ivan Perisic and Djed Spence to his squad this summer, taking Spurs' current haul of wing-backs to six with Emerson Royal, Matt Doherty, Sergio Reguilon and Ryan Sessegnon already on the books. Lucas Moura has also been used there in pre-season while Dejan Kulusevski spent brief spells at wing-back last term. However, 90min understands the north London side would like to bring in one more option at right wing-back, with Spence's arrival primarily a way of helping Spurs' homegrown quota ahead of their return to the Champions League. Managing director of football Fabio Paratici has reignited talks with Roma over Nicolo Zaniolo in recent days, with Conte and Giallorossi boss Jose Mourinho both seeing a future for the Italy star at wing-back. Listen now to 90min's Talking Transfers podcast, with  Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  &  Toby Cudworth. On the latest show they discuss Chelsea finally closing in on Jules Kounde, Man Utd's ongoing pursuit of Frenkie de Jong, West Ham's hunt for a new forward and left-back and more.
