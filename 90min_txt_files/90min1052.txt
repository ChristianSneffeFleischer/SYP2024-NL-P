Dejan Kulusevski has admitted that he doesn't know if he'll return to Tottenham Hotspur following the last game of his loan deal.  The wide forward has been on loan at Tottenham since January 2022 on an initial 18-month loan. Tottenham would have had an obligation to sign the player on a permanent deal for a reported  Â£30m, but their failure to qualify for the UEFA Champions League - having finishing eighth in the Premier League - means that said obligation was not triggered.  Due to this, rumours have begun to swirl regarding the Swede's future with the Lilywhites after it previously seemed like a forgone conclusion that he'd sign a long-term deal in north London.  Speaking after his final game, a 4-1 win over relegated Leeds United before his scheduled return to parent club Juventus, Kulusevski admitted he was unsure where his future lies. feed    I don't know, honestly, we will see," Kulusevski confessed. "I am just focused on the pitch, I tried to do as good as I can and now of course it's time to speak with the club.    The 23-year-old has generally impressed at Tottenham when fit, bagging seven assists during his full season at the club. At the tail end of the 2021/22 campaign Kulusevski was arguably the club's best player (along with Harry Kane obviously), scoring five and bagging eight assists in 18 games as Tottenham rallied to secure Champions League football.  Injuries have largely hindered his progress however, with a thigh injury seeing him miss 10 games this season.  Kulusevski ends his loan with Tottenham having made 57 appearances in all competitions, scoring seven goals and adding 16 assists.
