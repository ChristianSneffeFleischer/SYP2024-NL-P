N'Golo Kante is close to reaching an agreement with Chelsea over terms of a new contract, sources have told 90min. The Frenchman has won every trophy available to him bar the EFL Cup since heading to the Blues from Leicester City in 2016, cementing his status as a club legend. With his current contract up in the summer, speculation has rumbled on in recent months regarding Kante's future at Chelsea. 90min understands he has held talks and remains in contact with the likes of Inter, Juventus and Paris Saint-Germain. However, Kante's priority has always been to extend his stay at Chelsea. Talks over a fresh deal are advancing and most terms have been agreed in principle, with only the length of the contract and a few other minor details left to sort. Kante has featured just twice for Chelsea so far this season after picking up a hamstring injury in August's 2-2 draw at home to Tottenham, while he is yet to play under Graham Potter. The 31-year-old has missed 30 games for Chelsea this term and was ruled out of a place in Didier Deschamps' France squad for the mid-season World Cup. He recently resumed outdoor work and could return to first-team action in the near future.
