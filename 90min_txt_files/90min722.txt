Bayern Munich have confirmed the signing of Raphael Guerreiro on a free transfer from rivals Borussia Dortmund. Guerreiro allowed his contract at Signal-Iduna Park to expire this summer and he was heavily courted by several sides across Europe. 90min reported back in March that he had several suitors from the Premier League, with the likes of Newcastle United and Aston Villa interested in him. But Guerreiro has made the decision to join BVB's fierce foes Bayern, linking up with former boss Thomas Tuchel at the Allianz Arena. "When the call came from FC Bayern, my decision was made quickly," Guerreiro said to Bayern's club channels. "It's an honour for me to play for this big club and I also really appreciate Thomas Tuchel from our time together at Dortmund. "I'm a player who always likes to have the ball - it's about dominating the game and I want to create chances. I will do everything to win as many titles as possible. That is the philosophy of FC Bayern." feed Guerreiro leaves Dortmund having been beaten to the Bundesliga title in agonising fashion by Bayern on the last day of the 2022/23 season. BVB led the table by two points but with an inferior goal difference and could only manage a 2-2 draw at home to Mainz - Guerreiro won his side a first-half penalty, which was missed by Sebastien Haller - while Bayern left it late to beat Koln 2-1 and secure an 11th-straight championship.
