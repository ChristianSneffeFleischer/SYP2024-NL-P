Wolves manager Bruno Lage has stated that no offers have been received for star winger Pedro Neto, who has emerged as a target for Arsenal this summer. The Gunners were made aware of Neto   s potential availability earlier this month, alongside both Manchester United and Chelsea. But as 90min revealed at the start of this week, it is Arsenal who are now looking to push ahead with an approach for the 22-year-old Portugal international. They have been searching for someone to bolster the right flank all summer, having previously missed out on Raphinha. The Gunners are also looking to move on flop record signing Nicolas Pepe.    I have heard that but nothing has come to us,    Lage said    It   s normal now [to have interest], with the good players that we have. Teams are looking for good players in the same way we are looking for [Goncalo] Guedes, Matheus [Nunes], [Nathan] Collins.    No one told me anything about any proposal.    Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey,  Toby Cudworth  and  Harry Symeou  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Antony attempting to push through a move to Man Utd, Frenkie de Jong and Pierre-Emerick Aubayemang's futures at Barcelona and Arsenal's interest in Pedro Neto.
