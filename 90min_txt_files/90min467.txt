Paris Saint-Germain have completed the signing of French defender Lucas Hernandez from Bayern Munich. Personal terms were agreed with Lucas back in May around the same time as an agreement was struck to bring Manuel Ugarte to the French capital, but agreeing a deal with Bayern proved slightly more complicated. A fee of around    50m was eventually hammered out between the two clubs and Lucas has now sealed his move to PSG, signing a five-year contract until 2028. feed Born in Marseille, Lucas has never played club football in France. He moved to Spain aged four and, after coming through the Atletico Madrid academy, joined Bayern for a fee of    80m in 2019. Injuries would prove to be a problem for Lucas in Germany, however. He managed just 107 appearances for the club across his four seasons with Bayern and only played 11 games last year as a result of a various serious fitness issues. Lucas will now have the chance to rebuild his fitness in Paris, while Bayern are set to replace the France international with Kim Min-jae of Napoli. The South Korean's release clause has been triggered and paid, with completion of the    50m deal expected imminently.
