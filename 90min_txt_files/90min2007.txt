Manchester City are set to win the race to sign Velez Sarsfield midfielder Maximo Perrone, 90min understands. The 19-year-old has been on the radars of a number of sides across Europe, with Benfica the latest to express an interest in Perrone as they brace themselves for the possible departure of Chelsea target Enzo Fernandez. Newcastle United and Wolverhampton Wanderers have both chased Perrone's signature as well but sources have confirmed to 90min that it is City who will complete a deal for the midfielder. Personal terms were not a problem in negotiations and City have since confirmed to Velez their willingness to trigger his release clause, which sits at about $9m ( Â£7.5m), in order to finalise the deal. Perrone is due in Manchester to put pen to paper on a long-term contract before returning to South America to take part in the CONMEBOL Sudamericano Sub-20 with Argentina, which begins on January 19.
