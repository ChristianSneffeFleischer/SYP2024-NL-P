Sporting CP boss Ruben Amorim has admitted that the club are at a disadvantage when it comes to persuading the likes of Pedro Porro and Marcus Edwards to stay, but they will only be able to leave if their respective release clauses are triggered. 90min understands that right-back Porro is a target for Tottenham, while Barcelona have been linked with a move for the Spaniard in recent days. Spurs academy product Marcus Edwards has also been tipped to leave, potentially to return to north London. Amorim has already faced multiple questions regarding the pair's future since the January transfer window opened, and speaking to Record, he further discussed the possibility of his star players moving on. "We are not as attractive a league as others and we cannot pay the same wages. This is a problem, even in relation to Portuguese clubs we have this difficulty," he said. "As was said, they only leave for the clause. We are ready. We know the amount of attacks that go through Porro and Edwards, nobody is blind here. But the market is what it is."
