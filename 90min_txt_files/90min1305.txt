"Melarana [Tigre's president] said that in July it could be likely that I'll be sold. I really like the idea, it is a dream for everyone who plays football, the greatest teams are in Europe. In Italy there are great clubs, I like them all," Retegui said. "There's nothing concrete and I don   t know what   s going on, it's dad who   s taking care of the future."
