Manchester City are pushing ahead with their pursuit of Aston Villa and England star Jack Grealish and are confident of securing his signature after making their first move for him earlier this summer. Despite their Premier League dominance, Pep Guardiola is looking to revamp his squad     particularly in the final third - and Bernardo Silva could be amongst the players moved on, especially given the interest in Grealish. Aston Villa's captain is contracted to his hometown club for another four years after signing an extension last year, but 90min understands that his future is far from resolved and City remain keen to add him to their ranks this summer. Grealish played a good part, although possibly not as a big as he would have wanted, in England   s Euro 2020 campaign which ended in heartbreak in the final against Italy. He is now left with a decision about his own future as Villa would like to keep him and, despite having him under contract, they are ready to make him one of the highest paid players in the Premier League. 90min revealed in February that the club   s owners Nassef Sawiris and Wes Edens had plans to offer Grealish over  £200,000-a-week and that remains the case, indeed they are ready to go to  £250,000-a-week if necessary. However, Grealish is aware that City are ready to strike a deal worth up to  £100m and Villa too are making some plans should they lose him.  Talks are set to intensify over the coming week over a possible deal and relations between the two clubs have been good in recent years. 90min can also confirm that City remain interested in signing a centre forward this summer. With Sergio Aguero leaving and little appetite to consider Gabriel Jesus as his long-term successor     indeed there is a chance he could be moved on     there is a real need for a front-man.
