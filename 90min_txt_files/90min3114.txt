Ajax have raised their asking price for Manchester United target Lisandro Martinez to    60m as talks between the two sides continue over a transfer, 90min understands. United have made two offers for the Argentina international, primarily a centre-back but also able to play at left back and in defensive midfield, and have made Martinez their number one defensive target in recent weeks due to Erik ten Hag's desire to sign the player. Martinez's representatives had assured United that    50m was the Dutch champions' asking price - United have made it to that figure with their latest bid - though Ajax are now determined to extract more from the deal having raised significant funds through the sales of other first team players. 90min understands the player is angry at Ajax's response and feels United's latest bid is more than satisfactory, though it remains to be seen where and if an agreement will be struck. Arsenal, who opened the bidding, have backed away as it stands though have not yet dropped their interest in the 24-year-old. United's recruitment team have long coveted Villarreal's Pau Torres, who could be available for around  £45m this summer, though Ten Hag is looking to sign players familiar with his style of play in his first summer in charge. Martinez was initially signed by Ten Hag at Ajax three summers ago and has made well over 100 appearances for them since. Ajax right winger Antony is also of great interest to Ten Hag and United, though they are encountering similar issues for the Brazilian, who is now valued at as much as    80m. United remain in talks for both but Ajax's valuation for the pair sits currently at    140m (close to  £120m) and is far more than United initially intended to pay.
