Bayern Munich are continuing to scour the goalkeeper market and are now keeping tabs on Spanish duo Kepa Arrizabalaga and David de Gea, sources have confirmed to 90min. The German champions have been looking to add another stopper to their ranks while Manuel Neuer continues his recovery from a broken leg that he suffered during a skiing trip back in December. They had previously looked at Brentford's David Raya, but like Tottenham Hotspur refused to match the  £40m valuation. The Bees have since agreed to sell him to Arsenal for  £30m. With Yann Sommer signing for Inter in recent days, Bayern are stepping up their pursuit of a new goalkeeper. 90min understands they have made an enquiry to Chelsea regarding Kepa. feed The Blues are open to selling their current number one, who has two years left to run on his contract at Stamford Bridge, but Bayern's interest has not gone beyond this initial enquiry. Chelsea have brought in a goalkeeper of their own this transfer window, signing Robert Sanchez from Brighton for a fee in the region of  £20m. 90min understands that Bayern are also considering making a contract offer to free agent De Gea, who has been without a club since July after leaving Manchester United. De Gea also has suitors in the Saudi Pro League and it remains to be seen whether he would turn down such lucrative offers to join Bayern as a backup. Other goalkeepers on Bayern's shortlist include Porto's Diogo Costa and Valencia's Giorgi Mamardashvili, who have both been monitored by Premier League clubs in the past year.
