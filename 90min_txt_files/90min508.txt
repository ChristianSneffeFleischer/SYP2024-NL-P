Cesar Azpilicueta is in Madrid to put the finishing touches on his move to Atletico Madrid, 90min understands. The veteran defender had been expected to join Inter after agreeing a contract with the Serie A side, but Atletico made a late swoop to lure Azpilicueta back to Spain and quickly convinced him to head to the Wanda Metropolitano instead. A two-year contract is on the table for Azpilicueta, who is in Madrid for medical tests ahead of sealing his exit from Chelsea. Chelsea have granted Azpilicueta a free transfer away from Stamford Bridge as a show of respect to the 33-year-old, who joined in 2012 and has made more appearances for the club than any other overseas player. feed Azpilicueta came close to a return to Spain last year when Barcelona came calling, but the defender instead opted to stay at Chelsea to help steer the Blues through their transition to the BlueCo ownership era. However, with game time now hard to come by for the 33-year-old, Azpilicueta will now be allowed to leave the club and he has chosen Atletico for his new home. Chelsea are already prepared for his departure, bringing in right-back Malo Gusto from Lyon in January, while the returning Levi Colwill will also ensure the Blues are not caught out at centre-back either. Azpilicueta will leave Chelsea with 508 appearances to his name, putting him sixth on the club's all-time appearance charts, and a trophy cabinet full of nine pieces of silverware.
