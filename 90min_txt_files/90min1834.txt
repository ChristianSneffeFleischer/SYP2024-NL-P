Former Chelsea forward Timo Werner has admitted he won   t give any direct advice to teammate Christopher Nkunku as he prepares to make the summer switch to Stamford Bridge, only that time and experience will be an important ally to the Frenchman. Werner has, however, warned that Chelsea is a different beast to what Nkunku is used to at Leipzig. Nkunku has become one of the most prolific forwards in Europe since 2021 and has recorded 76 combined goals and assists for Leipzig in the last 18 months alone. There is yet to be any public confirmation of Nkunku   s move to Chelsea, but 90min reported in November that the finishing touches were being put on a pre-arranged summer transfer. The Blues made clear a willingness to pay slightly over a  Â£56m release clause coming into play at the end of the season in order to secure the player ahead of time, with the knee injury that ruled Nkunku out of the World Cup with France ending any chances of a deal going through this month. Werner already made the same move from Leipzig to Chelsea in 2020, only to end up heading back on a permanent deal just two years later.
