Tottenham are looking to sign a creative player this summer, with Sampdoria's Mikkel Damsgaard and PSV Eindhoven's Noni Madueke among their top targets.   Spurs have been active in the transfer market already, signing young forward Bryan Gil from Sevilla and also recruiting Atalanta goalkeeper Pierluigi Gollini on loan. They are inching closer to signing a centre-back as well, with  £42.7m Cristian Romero set to become their third arrival of the summer.   Nuno Esp  rito Santo is not done yet, though. According to the Evening Standard, Spurs are now eyeing up another attacking player. Last season they were heavily reliant on Harry Kane and Son Heung-min going forward and Espirito Santo is looking to spread the workload more evenly this time out.   Damsgaard is one of the players Spurs are tracking. Their interest was first reported last month, with Tottenham said to be readying a bid for the attacking midfielder. Damsgaard enjoyed a terrific Euro 2020 for Denmark, netting twice as his side reached the semi-finals.   Sampdoria are understood to value him at around    50m ( £42.5m). For now, this would put him out of Spurs    price range but if they manage to sell some fringe players they could make a move.   Another player Tottenham are eyeing up is Madueke. Ironically, he came through Spurs    youth academy before opting to move to PSV in 2018 in search of first team football. Since then he has established himself as one of Europe   s brightest talents, registering seven goals and six assists in the Eredivisie last season.
