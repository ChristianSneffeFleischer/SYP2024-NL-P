Lyon forward Memphis Depay has kept speculation over his future alive by refusing to rule out a January transfer, as rumours of Barcelona's interest continue. The 26-year-old was a known target for Bar  a during the summer window, with Ronald Koeman having worked with the player during his time as Netherlands national team coach. However, the deal ultimately never happened with Bar  a's well-documented financial issues wreaking havoc with their recruitment strategy. Depay himself revealed last month: "The agreement [with Barcelona] was very close. We do not have to go into all the details, but in reality it was almost done. Unfortunately, certain rules stopped it." Though Barcelona's off-field drama continues, the club could well attempt to enter the market for another forward when the transfer window re-opens in under two months, having lost wonderkid Ansu Fati to a serious knee injury. Asked about his short-term future following the 2-1 win over Saint-Etienne on Sunday evening, Depay refused to 'make promises'.    You ask me this question a lot," he said, as quoted by Mundo Deportivo. "But I'm not going to make promises that I'm not sure I can keep.  I think Lyon has to take advantage of my presence here now.

You can ask those around me: I like to train and I try to be positive every day." According to Mundo Deportivo, Depay and Barcelona already have a 'verbal agreement' and all that remains would be to negotiate a fee with Lyon.
