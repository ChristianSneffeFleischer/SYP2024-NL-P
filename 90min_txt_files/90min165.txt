Arsenal will enter talks with Brentford over the potential transfer of goalkeeper David Raya and could make a bid close to their lofty asking price, sources have confirmed to 90min. Raya is into the final year of his contract at the Gtech Community Stadium and has publicly admitted to turning down several offers to commit his long-term future to the Bees. Though Brentford are willing to let Raya go this summer, they have reiterated for months that they will only consider offers of  £40m. 90min were first to report back in March they are even open to him leaving on a free transfer next summer, and this stance remains despite signing Mark Flekken from Freiburg. Tottenham Hotspur had agreed personal terms with Raya in June but were unwilling to meet Brentford's demands and instead signed Guglielmo Vicario from Empoli, while Bayern Munich have also been put off by such a high figure. feed 90min reported on Monday that Arsenal were exploring a deal for Raya, who would crucially count as a homegrown player under Premier League and UEFA regulations. The Gunners have now reached a broad agreement with the Spain international over a contract. Arsenal are now preparing an offer to present to Brentford which could come close to their  £40m valuation, though this would be made up with a significant sum of add-ons. Raya is pushing for Brentford to allow him to move to the Emirates Stadium, where he is prepared to play second fiddle to Aaron Ramsdale. Arsenal's number one signed a new long-term contract earlier this summer. Meanwhile, the representatives of Arsenal's current backup goalkeeper, Matt Turner, are exploring potential exit routes out of north London. The USMNT stopper is on the radar of Nottingham Forest, while he also has suitors from mainland Europe. Turner is keen to play regular first-team football next season.
