Newcastle United have finalised the signing of right-back Tino Livramento from Southampton. A fee of around  £35m, plus a further  £5m in add-ons, has been paid by Newcastle, with around 40% of that sum heading to Livramento's boyhood club Chelsea as a result of a sell-on clause included in his 2021 switch to St Mary's Stadium. Livramento has now put pen to paper on a five-year contract to become Newcastle's fourth signing of the summer after Sandro Tonali, Harvey Barnes and Yankuba Minteh. "I'm really excited to have signed for Newcastle United and I'm looking forward to playing in front of the fans," Livramento told club media. "I was here for the games over the weekend; even though they were friendlies, there were so many fans and they were still so loud so I can't wait to see what it feels like to play in front of them in a Premier League or Champions League game. "The way the manager plays football is really attractive and I feel like it suits me as a player. And with how well the team did last season, the trajectory that we're on now, I'm just looking forward to being a part of that. "And to be able to learn from Kieran Trippier is another big thing for me; hopefully he teaches me how to become a better player and a better full-back." feed Manager Eddie Howe added: "Tino is a very talented young player with an exciting future ahead of him so we are delighted to sign him. "At 20, he already has lots of attributes that I admire but he also has the potential and drive to really grow with this team. I'm looking forward to working with him and to seeing him develop in a Newcastle shirt." Livramento will now compete for minutes at right-back with 32-year-old Trippier but is also comfortable further forward up the field.
