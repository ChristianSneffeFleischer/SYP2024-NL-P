Tottenham are the latest English side to express an interest in signing Sassuolo right back Mert Muldur. The 22-year-old Turkey international has enjoyed a few impressive seasons with Sassuolo, shining on both sides of the defence and earning himself plenty of admirers. West Ham have been linked with Muldur, while Arsenal are also understood to be scouting the right back as part of their mass summer shopping spree. The latest team to join the fun are Tottenham, whom the Daily Mail state have been impressed with his versatility and have added Muldur to their list of potential targets. Spurs may find themselves needing to sign a new right-back this summer. While the hope is that Matt Doherty can shine under former Wolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo, there are doubts over the future of Serge Aurier, who is wanted by a handful of sides across Europe. Aurier has confirmed his desire to leave Spurs this summer and hopes to seal a return to Paris Saint-Germain, but Atletico Madrid, AC Milan and Real Madrid have all been tipped to move for the Ivorian as well. With Aurier out of contract next summer, it seems likely that he will be sold in the coming weeks, and new sporting director Fabio Paratici has recommended Muldur to the club's recruitment department. Paratici is in talks with Nuno to finalise their transfer plans for this summer. While most of the talk has revolved around the future of striker Harry Kane, Spurs must focus on plugging the other holes in the squad, including at right-back. Norwich City's Max Aarons has been named as a potential option, as has Brighton's Tariq Lamptey, but there are fears the young Englishmen could be too expensive.
