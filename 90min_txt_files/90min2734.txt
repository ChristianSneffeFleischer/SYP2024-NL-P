West Ham have confirmed the signing of Paris Saint-Germain defender Thilo Kehrer on a four-contract with a two-year option. The Germany international is West Ham's sixth summer signing after the arrivals of Nayef Aguerd, Alphonse Areola, Gianluca Scamacca, Maxwel Cornet and Flynn Downes. 90min revealed earlier this week the two clubs had agreed a    12m fee plus add ons for Kehrer, who had less than a year left on his contract in France. He has ignored interest from Sevilla to sign for the Irons.    I   m very excited to sign for West Ham United,    he told the club's website. "This is the best league in the world and I   m excited about coming to play in the Premier League.    I talked to the manager and he told me about how he sees me fitting in at the club. My biggest goal now is to get into the team, integrate myself within the group and enjoy playing for West Ham.    Kehrer's arrival is a manger boost for manager David Moyes, who has been short of options in central defence in recent weeks. Ben Johnson has partnered Kurt Zouma at the back, with Aguerd out injured and both Angelo Ogbonna and Craig Dawson struggling for fitness. Moyes added:    I am really pleased to welcome Thilo to West Ham United.  He   s a talented player, who can play in a number of defensive positions, adding strength and depth to our current options.    Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  &  Toby Cudworth  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Erik ten Hag wanting to sign five players before the transfer window closes, and Man Utd's attitude to selling Cristiano Ronaldo.
