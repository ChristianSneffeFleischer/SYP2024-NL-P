Manchester United superstar Cristiano Ronaldo has asked the club to consider any suitable transfer offers for him as he weighs up leaving Old Trafford just a year after his sensational return last summer, 90min can confirm. The 37-year-old re-signed for United in August, 12 years after first leaving the club for Real Madrid in what was then a world record transfer. Ronaldo went on to score 24 goals in all competitions to finish the campaign as the club   s top scorer by some distance. Overall, United had a very poor season, falling well short of winning any silverware and extending the club   s trophy drought into a sixth year in what was their worst ever Premier League campaign. For Ronaldo, it proved to be the first season since 2004/05 that he didn   t win at least one trophy. Subsequently, the Portugal international - who has one more year left on the contract he signed last summer - has requested that United consider any suitable offers that come in for him this summer. 90min understands that Chelsea, Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain have all spoken to intermediaries exploring a potential deal within past fortnight. Indeed, 90min reported last week that new Chelsea owner Todd Boehly has met with Ronaldo's agent Jorge Mendes to discuss a number of his clients, and his name was raised. A meeting with Ronaldo was among new permanent manager Erik ten Hag   s first acts in charge when he started work at Old Trafford in May, and sources have told 90min that he is a key figure in the Dutchman's plans for the upcoming season.
