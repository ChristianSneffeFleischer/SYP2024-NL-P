Leeds United are closing in on a deals for Feyenoord winger Luis Sinisterra and RB Leipzig midfielder Tyler Adams, 90min understands. Leeds have already bolstered their squad this summer with the signings of Brenden Aaronson, Rasmus Kristensen, Marc Roca and Darko Gyabi - but they are still planning to improve the squad available to manager Jesse Marsch ahead of a season without a handful of key players. The West Yorkshire outfit have finalised the sale of Kalvin Phillips to Manchester City and Raphinha is set to follow him - almost certainly to Barcelona after the La Liga side agreed to increase their bid. And Leeds have their replacements lined up in the shape of Sinisterra and Adams - both long-term targets for the Whites. Colombian winger Sinisterra has long been linked with a move to the Premier League and now Leeds have made their move, and sources have told 90min that they have agreed a deal that could be worth up to  Â£25m to Feyenoord - a record fee for the Dutch club. A deal for 23-year-old Sinisterra is now close and Leeds expect him to complete his move before the weekend, and they also have the same hope for Adams. Leeds have been taking their time looking for the player who is best suited to step in for Phillips and two of the prime candidates emerged as Adams and Red Bull Salzburg's Mohamed Camara, both of whom have already worked under Marsch.
