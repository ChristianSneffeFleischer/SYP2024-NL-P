The Portland Timbers are moving to complete the signing of Venezuelan midfielder Abraham Bahachille, 90min sources confirm. The 20-year-old is a free agent after leaving Metropolitanos FC at the end of 2021. As reported by FUTVE English, Bahachille has been on trial with the Timbers and played 90 minutes at center-back in a recent 0-0 friendly draw against the Seattle Sounders. Despite receiving offers from Europe, 90min can confirm the Timbers are now in pole position to complete the free transfer of Bahachille ahead of the 2022 MLS season. Bahachille leaves Metropolitanos with 54 senior appearances for the club under his belt, scoring three goals and assisting another. During that time, he helped Los Violetas qualify for the Copa Sudamericana on two occasions.  A dominating physical presence and astute defender, he's also clean and calm with the ball at his feet and can operate at the base of midfield or at the heart of a three-man center-back system.  Bahachille, who was out of contract at the end of 2021, was one of two trialists to start yesterday. From the XI, two were academy players, one was newly drafted, and six were existing first team players.Timbers are managed by Venezuelan Gio Savarese. https://t.co/uqgZclokxu
