Angers are continuing talks with a number of clubs over their star midfielder Azzedine Ounahi, sources have confirmed to 90min. Leicester City launched a bid earlier this month, with Serie A leaders Napoli firming up their interest with a rival bid soon after. The latest concrete offer to Angers has come in from Leeds United, while AC Milan are also considering whether to make a move for the one of the stars of this winter's World Cup finals. Sources have told 90min that Ounahi would likely prefer a move to Italy, but Angers have not rejected any offers so far. Angers have always stated their preferred option is to agree the sale of Ounahi but then keep him until the summer to help in their fight against relegation - something Napoli have offered as part of their bid.
