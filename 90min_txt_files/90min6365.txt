Champions League-chasing Leicester City could offer Real Madrid outcast Luka Jovic a way out of the Spanish capital this summer.  The 22-year old has endured a miserable season at the Bernabeu, scoring just twice all season and starting only four games in La Liga after arriving for a fee in the region of    60m last summer.  This is, essentially, the first time that Jovic has had a poor season since breaking into senior football     the Serbian international scored 36 goals in 75 appearances in a two-year spell in Germany - form which encouraged Real Madrid to sign him for  £54m in the summer.  Brendan Rodgers is reportedly ready to offer the presumptive La Liga winners a chance to offload the striker, with the Daily Star reporting that just  £31m could be enough for the Foxes to get their man.  Leicester, who currently sit in fourth in the Premier League, may be looking for a long-term replacement for top scorer Jamie Vardy, who turned 33 in January     with Kelechi Iheanacho yet to stamp his mark on the team.  Despite his age, Vardy has shown no signs of slowing down, and leads the Premier League's Golden Boot race with an impressive 22 goals.  However, should the Midlands side want to bring Jovic to the King Power Stadium, they may face competition from fellow Premier League clubs Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur.  The Blues were linked with a loan move for the Serbian back in January, although their interest may have cooled following the signing of RB Leipzig striker Timo Werner.  Jose Mourinho's side were also said to be in for a loan move for the striker following Harry Kane's injury on New Year's Day. However, no transfer materialised and the north London side remain without a true backup to the England international.
