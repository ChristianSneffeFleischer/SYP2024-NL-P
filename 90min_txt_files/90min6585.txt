Tottenham Hotspur are the latest club to consider a move for Paris Saint-Germain centre-back Thiago Silva, who will walk away from the Parc des Princes once the Champions League comes to a close. The 35-year-old will join Edinson Cavani in leaving the club this summer once their contracts expire, and there is expected to be no shortage of interest in both players. For Silva, 90min has learned that several Premier League sides are considering bids, including Arsenal and Everton, and The Sun now throw Spurs' name into the mix as well. With Jan Vertonghen set to leave the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium this summer, Jos   Mourinho knows that he needs to find a replacement, and with money expected to be tight this summer, the chance to land Silva on a free transfer is thought to be appealing to the boss. However, those same money struggles could yet prove to be a problem as Silva is currently earning around  Â£350,000-a-week in Paris. He will almost certainly accept a lower salary at this point in his career, but whether he will go low enough to please Spurs remains to be seen. Despite interest from Brazil and a whole host of countries around the world, Silva insisted to Caras that he still sees his future in Europe. "Everyone knows the affection I have for Fluminense. But I still have goals to reach in Europe," he revealed. Silva is yet to make a decision on his future as he waits for clubs to line up their offers to him. Newcastle, Wolverhampton Wanderers and West Ham are all considering moves, while former side AC Milan have also been heavily linked with a move to bring Silva back to San Siro.  ??

The chance to pick up a star like Thiago, despite his age, is clearly appealing and the interest in the Premier League is actually growing.
