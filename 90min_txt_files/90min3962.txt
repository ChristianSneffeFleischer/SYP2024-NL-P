Inter have confirmed the double signing of AS Roma striker Edin Dzeko and PSV Eindhoven full-back Denzel Dumfries, as the Italian champions rebuild their squad ahead of the new season.  I Nerazzurri have been working to plug the gaps left by the departed superstars Romelu Lukaku and Achraf Hakimi, with the club facing some very public financial turmoil.  ? | ANNOUNCEMENT@EdDzeko is an #Inter player    ?? https://t.co/eMw6uErh9C#WelcomeEdin #IMInter pic.twitter.com/01KL4Ia5Mh But Inter announced on Saturday night that they had completed the transfers of both Dzeko and Dumfries after a 3-0 pre-season victory over Dynamo Kiev.  Dzeko's move has been in the pipeline for several days, and he even played - and scored - in the win over Dynamo, despite having not yet been officially confirmed as a Nerazzurri star. The Bosnian forward has joined on a two-year deal, leaving Roma after six years in the Italian capital. The 35-year-old made a huge impact in Rome, becoming the club's third highest scorer of all time with 119 goals. He played a key role in their run to the Champions League semi-finals in 2018, scoring against both Barcelona and Liverpool.  Minutes after confirming Dzeko's arrival, Inter then announced the signing of attacking full-back Dumfries. The 25-year-old has signed a contract that runs until the summer of 2025 at San Siro, waving goodbye to PSV, where he's spent the past three years of his career.  Dumfries was a star at Euro 2020, scoring twice and providing one assist for the Netherlands in the summer tournament. He was unable to prevent his nation from slipping to a shock Round of 16 exit at the hands of Czech Republic, but he did enough to land himself a big move to a European giant.
