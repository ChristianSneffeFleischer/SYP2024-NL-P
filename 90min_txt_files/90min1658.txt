Southampton's search to bring in a new striker is set to see them land Paul Onuachu, 90min understands. The Saints have been targeting new forwards in order to finally replace the gaping hole left by Danny Ings' departure in 2021. 90min reported on Monday that Southampton were hopeful of signing Braga striker Vitinha, only for Marseille to swoop in and snatch him from under their noses on deadline day. But the south coast club have acted quickly in order to bring in another body up front, agreeing a    20m deal with Genk to sign Onuachu. The Nigeria international stands at 6ft7 and has scored 17 goals in 22 games for Genk in all competitions so far this season. He has reached double figures of goals in his last seven campaigns, and notably grabbed 35 in 41 during Genk's 2020/21 season. Everton were also interested in his services this window. Southampton are also looking to conclude a deal for Rennes' Ghanaian winger Kamaldeen Sulemana, who was also a target for Everton in recent days.
