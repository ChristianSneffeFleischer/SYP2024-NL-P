Sergio Romero will speak to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to discuss his future after growing frustrated at the lack of first-team opportunities at Manchester United. The goalkeeper joined the club from Sampdoria in 2015, but his time at Old Trafford has involved a lot of sitting, watching and waiting. Almost exclusively being used in cup competitions, he's featured just 59 times in his five seasons.  D  a de juego! Game day! @manchesterunited @europaleague A post shared by  Sergio Romero (@sergioromero) on Oct 24, 2019 at 6:57am PDT Due to that, The Sun are reporting that the Argentine and his representatives are set to meet with United officials to seek clarity on his future, one we can safely assume is away from Manchester. Romero has been used fleetingly, but even those appearances could be hard to come by with the future of Dean Henderson still not certain. The keeper was loaned out to Sheffield United for the second season running last term, but talk of him returning to Bramall Lane for another stint has dried up amid a series of David de Gea errors. Lee Grant recently put pen to paper on another year-long contract at the club, a further indication that Romero looks set to be on the move. If both players are to battle it out for the number one spot at Old Trafford, then Romero would be forced to drop down to third choice, something the 33-year-old is understandably not keen on. He has 12 months left on his current deal with the option of a further year, but there is interest in his services from his homeland, MLS and in Europe. United are thought to be asking for a fee of around  Â£5m to part with the stopper.
