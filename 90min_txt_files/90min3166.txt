Jesse Marsch's side have already signed Brenden Aaronson, Rasmus Kristensen, Marc Roca and Darko Gyabi this summer, and they are set to seal a further two deals soon with medicals booked for Sinisterra and Adams. Colombia international Sinisterra is set to become Leeds' club-record signing after a  Â£25m fee was agreed with Europa Conference League runners-up Feyenoord. The 23-year-old scored 23 goals in 45 games in all competitions for the Rotterdam club last season.
