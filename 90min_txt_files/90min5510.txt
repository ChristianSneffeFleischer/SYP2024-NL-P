Negotiations between Roma and Manchester United have stalled regarding a deal for defender Chris Smalling, with the clubs still    5m apart in their valuations.  The Englishman shone for the Giallorossi in Serie A last term as he struck up a fine relationship with Gianluca Mancini at the heart of Paulo Fonseca's defence, and he was expected to complete a permanent move to the club this summer.  However, a deal is yet to be struck, and with Monday's transfer deadline fast approaching a growing sense of pessimism is building in the Roma camp. John Solano, journalist for Roma Press, reports that the Italian club are incredibly frustrated over the Smalling talks, with one club source describing the entire ordeal as 'embarrassing'. The two clubs met on Friday with the presence of an intermediary, Jozo Palac, in an attempt to wrap up a deal but the talks didn't conclude positively.  Roma have offered    15m for the 30-year-old's services, but United are still holding out for    20m.  Thus, with such a minor disparity in valuations, there's still hope that both parties can reach an agreement before Monday. Smalling himself is said to be pushing for a return to Rome after excelling under Fonseca last term.  However, Sky Sports Italy (via Roma Press) understands that United won't lower their    20m valuation but talks are set to continue between the two clubs. As of this moment, Roma do not have any alternatives to the Englishman. Although, they've already bolstered their defensive ranks this summer by adding talented Verona centre-back Marash Kumbulla.
