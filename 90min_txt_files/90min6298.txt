Tottenham have confirmed that midfielder Oliver Skipp has put pen to paper on a new four-year deal with the club, tying him down until the summer of 2024. Prior to lockdown, Skipp caught the eye of Jose Mourinho and started back-to-back fixtures against Burnley and Norwich. Since football resumed he's played only six first team minutes, but Spurs still see Skipp as one for the future and have rewarded him with a long-term deal.

He first signed a three-year contract back in 2018, with his first Premier League appearance coming in December that year as a late substitute in a home clash against Southampton. A statement on the club's official website read: "We are delighted to announce that Oliver Skipp has signed a new contract with the Club until 2024. The young midfielder has made 21 appearances for us to date, including featuring in our 2-1 win against Arsenal last weekend. "Born in Welwyn Garden City, the Academy product made his competitive debut for us in our 3-1 Carabao Cup win at West Ham United in October, 2018, and has also received national team honours, having representing England   s Under-21s, Under-18s, Under-17s and Under-16s. Mourinho recently spoke of his admiration for Skipp, who he brought on late in the 2-1 victory over rivals Arsenal:    We won, we beat them, we are above them and something I did because the team needed, and something I feel deeply, was to play Skipp. "Hopefully now I can push on and see what the future holds."Oliver Skipp on extending his stay at Spurs.#THFC        #COYS pic.twitter.com/m6I564kMJh
