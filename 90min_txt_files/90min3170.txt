Crystal Palace are currently the frontrunners to sign Wolves' Morgan Gibbs-White, 90min understands. The 22-year-old has emerged as one of England's most highly sought-after young forwards after a brilliant season on loan with Sheffield United in the Championship. He has turned down a new deal at parent club Wolves, who are now ready to let him leave Molineux as long as their asking price of just over  Â£20m is met. Nottingham Forest had been favourites to secure his signing. Manager Steve Cooper knows Gibbs-White well from their together in England's youth set-up, while he also signed him on loan while at Swansea City. But Patrick Vieira has encouraged Palace to push ahead with a move for Gibbs-White as they feel he could help plug the gap left by Conor Gallagher - who has returned to Chelsea following his loan stint.
