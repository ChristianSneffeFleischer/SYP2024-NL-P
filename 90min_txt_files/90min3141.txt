Leeds manager Jesse Marsch has issued an update on Raphinha's future, amid strong interest from Chelsea, Arsenal and Barcelona.  The forward has been Leeds' offensive talisman for the past two seasons but he is widely expected to depart Elland Road this summer.  90min understands that Raphinha is holding out on Barca agreeing a deal and currently has little interest in joining another Premier League club.  Leeds are scheduled to jet off to Australia on a pre-season tour imminently, but speaking after his side defeated Blackpool 4-0 on Thursday night, Marsch revealed that he did not know whether the Brazilian would be joining his teammates.     My guess is, I don't know,     responded  Marsch  over whether or not  Raphinha  would travel to Australia for  pre-season.     We just have to wait and see what happens in the next couple of days.    There's urgency from his end, I think, to come up with a solution. We have to in the next couple of days see how things stand and see how we go. Listen now to 90min's Talking Transfers podcast, with  Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey,  Harry Symeou  &  Toby Cudworth.
