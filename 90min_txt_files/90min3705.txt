Inter Miami have completed the signing of forward Ariel Lassiter from the Houston Dynamo. The Dynamo will receive $50k General Allocation Money (GAM) per year from the Herons for the next two years, as well as an additional amount of GAM if performance-based incentives are met.    We   re excited to continue strengthening the squad ahead of our 2022 season with the signing of Ariel," Inter Miami chief soccer officer and sporting director Chris Henderson said in an official club press release. "He has the ability to stretch teams with his quickness and pace, and looks to get behind to create scoring opportunities. He comes from a soccer family, brings good character to the club and we believe he can be a good fit to our team. We look forward to seeing him help us achieve our goals in the upcoming campaign." With previous experience in MLS with the LA Galaxy, Lassiter initially joined the Dynamo on loan from Costa Rican giants Alajuelense in August 2020 before signing permanently the following December. In 60 MLS appearances for Houston and LA combined, the 27-year-old has scored four goals and provided one assist. Lassiter is the son of former USMNT forward Roy Lassiter, who won the first-ever MLS Golden Boot in 1996 while with the Tampa Bay Mutiny and MLS Cup in 1999 with DC United.
