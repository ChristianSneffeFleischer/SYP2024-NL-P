Netherlands head coach Louis van Gaal has suggested young centre-back Jurrien Timber should think twice about a move to Manchester United this summer. 20-year-old Timber has emerged as a key member of the Ajax setup and the Dutchman already has seven caps for his country having made his debut a year ago. Timber's impressive performances have inevitably drawn some attention, and 90min understands new Man Utd manager Erik ten Hag is keen to take his former player to Old Trafford - although the Amsterdam giants have made him a substantial offer to stay at the club, not far short of what he would earn in Manchester. The defender is currently away on international duty with the Netherlands, and his national team manager was asked for his opinion on a potential move to United for his player. The legendary coach suggested the timing for such a big move might not quite be right for a young player in a World Cup year.
