Endrick will make a visit to Real Madrid at the end of November as the teen prodigy and his family continue to weigh up where his next move will be. Although FIFA rules prevent him from moving internationally until 2024, the 16-year-old is arguably the hottest new talent in world football right now and was attracting attention from huge clubs even before he had made his senior debut for Palmeiras. Three goals and an assist in seven Brasileirao appearances as Palmeiras lifted the Campeonato for the third time in seven years, only confirmed what scouts already suspected. Real Madrid are long thought to have been the frontrunners for Endrick   s signature, with chief scout Juni Calafat previously discovering Vincius Junior, Rodrygo and Federico Valverde in South America. 90min understands that Calafat first scouted Endrick when the youngster was only 13 and has been laying the groundwork to get him to the Bernabeu ever since. The player   s father Douglas has now confirmed that the family will travel over to Spain shortly, which could determine whether Endrick wishes to join Real.    We   ll travel to Madrid at the end of this month. After that conversation, Real Madrid will await a response from us to see if they should come and make a bid to Palmeiras,    Douglas told Brazilian media outlet UOL Esporte. Having been successful in securing Vini, Rodrygo and Valverde, the tactic mimics Real   s pursuit of a 14-year-old Neymar way back in 2006. They couldn   t persuade him to join on that occasion and he eventually moved to Europe seven years later with Barcelona instead. Real are aware they are not the only European super power interested in Endrick, though, with Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain also determined to tempt him their way.
