Wolves boss Julen Lopetegui has expressed hope that Adama Traore will sign a new contract at Molineux, with his current deal due to expire at the end of this season. Traore spent the second half of last season on loan with former club Barcelona but returned to Wolverhampton ahead of the 2022/23 campaign. He initially found himself on the periphery of Bruno Lage   s struggling side but there could be hope of a fresh start under Lopetegui. 90min understands Tottenham are long-time admirers of Traore, with Antonio Conte known to be a fan, while there is also significant interest in the Spain international from his homeland as well as Italy.    We have a big consideration about Adama and we are going to try, of course, to have him continue here,    said Lopetegui, who will take charge of his first Premier League game when Wolves visit Everton on Boxing Day.    But we will see. I don't know what is going to happen, but I know his commitment with us is big and this is my demand as a coach. After, I don't know what will happen.    I like Adama and the rest of the players on my team. For me, the best players are always on my team because they will be the main actors for the next few matches.    Traore, who first moved to England from hometown team Barcelona in 2015 and turned out for Aston Villa and Middlesbrough before joining Wolves in 2018, played his best football between 2019 and 2021. But he fell out of favour with Lage after a disappointing start to last season.
