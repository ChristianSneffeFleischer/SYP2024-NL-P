Inter are extremely close to signing free agent Paulo Dybala despite late interest from rivals AC Milan,  90min  understands. Dybala left Juventus as a free agent this summer after failing to come to terms on a new deal. The forward had been in talks with Juventus over an extension and even agreed on a new five-year contract worth    8m per year before Christmas. However, after those terms were altered by Juve at the last minute due to the forward's patchy injury record, talks collapsed. I Nerazzurri have long been  favourites  to sign Dybala following his departure from Juve, having pushed to get a deal over the line for the last few months. Now it looks like the deal is finally set to be done, with sources telling  90min the agreement is 95% finalised. The 2021/22 Coppa Italia champions' main competitors in the race to sign the number 10 have been their city rivals Milan in recent weeks, while we understand the player has also had tentative interest from Man Utd and Arsenal. Milan manager Stefano Pioli has commented on speculation surrounding Dybala, as well as the club's interest in Club Brugge star Charles De Ketelaere, stating: "De Ketelaere and Dybala are two very different profiles. I let the managers make the choices, they will make the best decision for the team."  With Inter all but set to sign Dybala, the decision to bring in De Ketelaere may be an easier one for the Milan hierarchy. As well as signing Dybala, Inter also recently announced the re-signing of Romelu Lukaku on loan from Chelsea. The forward endured a miserable tenure at the Blues but was fantastic at Inter during his previous two-year spell at the club - scoring 64 goals and winning a Scudetto.
