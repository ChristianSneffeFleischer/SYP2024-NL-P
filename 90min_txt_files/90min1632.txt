Chelsea have announced that they have completed a deal to sign Enzo Fernandez from Benfica for a British record transfer fee. Benfica confirmed in the early hours of Wednesday morning that the Blues will pay a staggering    121m fee to take the Argentina World Cup winner off their hands. The two sides were locked in talks throughout the January transfer window, but the move was not officially announced until after the deadline. But Chelsea have now confirmed that Fernandez has signed on at Stamford Bridge, becoming their eighth and final signing of the winter window. Chelsea had already brought in Benoit Badiashile, David Datro Fofana, Mykhailo Mudryk, Joao Felix, Noni Madueke, Andrey Santos and Malo Gusto, the latter of which will return to Lyon on loan for the remainder of the season.
