Former Juventus sporting director Giuseppe Marotta has admitted that Juventus came 'close' to signing Erling Haaland for    2m while at Molde, and deems the failure to get the transfer over the line as one of his 'biggest regrets.'  The Norwegian superstar is now one of the most sought-after players in world football. There will be a scramble for his signature next summer, when a release clause means he will be available for around    70m - an absolute bargain given his performances and limitless potential.  But Haaland's career could have taken a very different path had a move to Juventus materialised as planned. Marotta, the Bianconeri's former sporting director, has described the 21-year-old's failed move to Turin as one of his 'biggest regrets' after they let a    2m deal slip through their fingers.     One of my biggest regrets was Haaland deal. I was Juventus CEO and we had the chance to sign him for    2m from Molde...it was close," Marotta said. "Now it   s impossible to see Haaland in Serie A - there   s no chance for Italian clubs to sign him next summer."
