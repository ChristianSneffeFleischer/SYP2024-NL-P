Former United striker Van Nistelrooy, who was appointed new PSV head coach this summer after being in charge of the club   s Under-19 squad last season, hopes not to lose his star player. "There have been a lot of rumours for a long time, it   s clear we   d love to keep Gakpo here at PSV," the 46-old explained. But Van Nistelrooy also revealed that Gakpo is taking a mature approach to the situation and Is still putting in the same level of work despite the potential opportunity of a big money move. "I have been working with him for eight weeks now and have not seen a single moment that he shows different behaviour. That is very nice for someone his age," the PSV boss said.
