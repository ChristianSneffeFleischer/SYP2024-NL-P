Real Madrid have offered out-of-favour striker Mariano Diaz to West Ham United, one of multiple attacking options the Premier League side have been linked with to bolster their attack ahead of the January transfer window. Diaz, having come through Real Madrid's youth teams, is in his second spell in the Spanish capital after a productive season leading the line for French side Lyon in 2017/18. However, the 27-year-old has been afforded less than an hour of La Liga football since August 2019. Despite his lack of opportunities, Diaz found his way onto the scoresheet in Madrid's 2-0 win against Barcelona last March. Yet, the Dominican Republic international is thought to have a difficult relationship with Madrid's manager Zinedine Zidane, with some reports suggesting he is one of several players on the Frenchman's 'black list'. Given this supposedly frosty relationship and his lack of game-time, Madrid have offered West Ham the chance to sign Diaz on loan this January, according to the Daily Mail. The report claims Diaz rebuffed the advances of fellow Premier League side West Bromwich Albion in the summer given their status as a newly-promoted side, but could make a move to the east London outfit in the upcoming window. The Spanish publication Defensa Central supports the links between West Ham and Diaz but also suggests that Luka Jovic - another Real Madrid striker lacking any significant playing time - may be available on loan as well.
