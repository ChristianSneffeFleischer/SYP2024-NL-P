Several Premier League sides have registered an interest in signing Kyle Walker-Peters from Southampton, sources have told 90min. While the Saints have endured a miserable 2022/23 campaign thus far - they currently sit bottom of the Premier League table - the versatile full-back has been a shining light. His fine performances have not gone unnoticed, and 90min understands three of the 'big six' would like to sign him this month. Boyhood club Tottenham, who sold him for  Â£12m to Southampton back in 2020, are interested in bringing Walker-Peters back to north London. He made 24 senior appearances for Spurs and was part of their Champions League final matchday squad in 2019. Chelsea, who are on the hunt for competition and backup to Reece James, are too interested in Walker-Peters. 90min recently reported that Chelsea and Tottenham are mutually interested in Sporting CP's Pedro Porro in their respective searches for new right-backs.
