Inter remain determined to convince Milan Skriniar to sign a new contract, 90min understands, but are braced to receive bids for his services in the January transfer window. The centre-back is in the final six months of his contract and is now free to discuss a free transfer for the end of the season, and 90min has previously reported that nearly every European giant is interested in his services. The likes of Chelsea, Manchester City, Manchester United and Newcastle United are expected to offer contracts to Skriniar but the biggest complication for Inter could be offers to sign the Slovakia international immediately in January. Indeed, long-term admirers Paris Saint-Germain, who tried and failed to land Skriniar last summer, remain interested in the 27-year-old and see him as an ideal replacement for Sergio Ramos, who is being targeted by Al Nassr for an ambitious link-up with former teammate Cristiano Ronaldo. Should Ramos be lured away, PSG would be open to making a move to sign Skriniar in January but they may have to fend off rival interest from Liverpool, who are exploring their options following the news that Virgil van Dijk's hamstring injury is worse than first feared. Intermediaries have reached out to Inter to discuss the possibility of a January transfer to Anfield, and while Inter want to keep Skriniar, they would consider parting ways with the defender this month if he refuses to extend and approaches a free transfer at the end of the season. Selling Skriniar now would allow Inter to keep hold of right-back Denzel Dumfries, who is also a target for Chelsea and Tottenham. However, January offers could spark a bidding war among the sides keen to land Skriniar on a free transfer, and the centre-back may opt to accept a lucrative move in the summer instead of an immediate switch. Despite the outside interest, Inter's first priority is to convince Skriniar to re-sign, but CEO Beppe Marotta recently admitted that the Serie A side face a real battle to get a deal done.
