Manchester United believe their third offer for Mason Mount will be deemed acceptable by Chelsea, 90min understands. Mount is entering the final 12 months of his current contract at Stamford Bridge, and has declined contract extension offers from the club, thus opening the door to a potential move this summer. Sources have told 90min that the England international has agreed personal terms with Man Utd, and now the Red Devils are attempting to strike a deal with Chelsea in order to get the deal over the line. The Blues recently rejected an opening bid worth  £40m and a follow up bid of  £50m from Man Utd for the midfielder. Chelsea had initially demanded  £70m for Mount, but sources have confirmed that they would be willing to accept a bid of  £60m- £65m. feed 90min understands that a third bid has arrived worth an initial  £50m plus a further  £5m in add-ons, which still falls short of Chelsea's valuation. United believe this offer to be more than fair for a player in Mount's situation and have threatened to walk away from negotiations if this latest bid is rejected. Man Utd manager Erik ten Hag is a huge fan of the player and is pushing hard to get a deal finalised, seeing Mount as a key part of his plans at Old Trafford moving forward.
