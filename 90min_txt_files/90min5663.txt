Aston Villa have confirmed the arrival of winger Bertrand Traore from Lyon, with the Premier League outfit paying in the region of  £20m for his services. The 25-year-old made 35 appearances in all competitions for Lyon last season, but managed just the four goals and five assists. Despite his somewhat underwhelming 2019/20 campaign, Traore attracted interest from a number of Premier League clubs this summer - including Crystal Palace, Newcastle and Fulham.  ? #Traor  Announced ?Welcome to Aston Villa, Bertrand Traor  ! ? But it's Aston Villa who have won the race for his signature, with the news being confirmed on the club's official website. The Villans initially bid around  £15m for his services, which was rejected, but they later returned with an improved  £20m offer - which has proven to be enough. Speaking after the deal had been confirmed, Villa boss Dean Smith said:    We   re delighted that Bertrand has chosen to come to Villa. He   s a player with immense talent who will really enhance our attacking options.    Traore, meanwhile, has alluded to the fact that he will be surrounded by some familiar faces - notably John Terry, as the pair know each other from their Chelsea days. He told VillaTV:    I   m very happy to join Aston Villa. I'm happy to be here. I played with John Terry at Chelsea, I spoke to him.      ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?  ? ? ? ? ? ?
