Arsenal have agreed a deal worth  Â£450,000 for teenage Molde striker Nikolaj Duus Moller. The 18-year-old is expected to sign a four-year contract and has already had his medical at London Colney. According to Goal, the deal should be finalised before Monday's 11pm deadline. The Sweden Under-19 international would then link up with the club's Under-23 outfit, managed by Steve Bould, rather than the senior side. A post shared by Nikolaj Duus Mo  ller (@nikolajdmoller) on Aug 19, 2020 at 9:14am PDT Moller has previously been compared with compatriot Zlatan Ibrahimovic and spent time in Italy, playing for Bologna's youth sides. He scored three goals in 19 appearances for I Rossoblu's Under-17s before returning to Sweden. As for the Ibrahimovic comparisons, Moller stands at 6'4 and the Swedish media have also praised his technical ability. It's the latest addition for Bould's squad, coming after the incomings of Jonathan Dinzeyi, George Lewis and Tim Akinola. As for the senior side, Arsenal are edging closer to the signing of Atletico Madrid midfielder Thomas Partey. The Ghana international has completed a medical in Spain after the Gunners opted to pay his    50m release clause. Fans had previously been hoping for Lyon's Houssem Aouar, who impressed during the French side's run to the semi finals of the Champions League. However, that deal failed to materialise, and space has been left in the Arsenal squad for another central midfielder with Matteo Guendouzi's departure on loan to Hertha Berlin.
