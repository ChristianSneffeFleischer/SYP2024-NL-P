Christian Pulisic has discussed his Chelsea future as he continues to be linked with a move away from Stamford Bridge. 90min reported earlier this week that he is wanted by fellow Premier League clubs Liverpool and Newcastle on loan, while Atletico Madrid, Milan, Inter and former side Borussia Dortmund are also interested in his signature. While Pulisic was one of the stars for the USMNT on their run to the last 16 of this winter's World Cup, he has found game time at club level harder to come by this season, starting just four matches for Chelsea this term. Speaking on the Indirect Podcast, Pulisic discussed his future plans. "Right now I'm absolutely back at Chelsea," he began. "[I am] focused and ready to finish the season. "But you know how things work in football. Things change quickly and anything can happen. At the moment, I am just pushing myself in training and working at Chelsea because that's where I am right now."
