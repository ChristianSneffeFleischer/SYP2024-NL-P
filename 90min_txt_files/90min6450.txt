Manchester United have confirmed that Angel Gomes has left the club after turning down the offer of a new contract. The 19-year-old has been heavily linked with leaving Old Trafford in search of first team opportunities, having made only ten senior appearances for the Red Devils since making his debut in 2017. A promise is a promise ?    @agomes_47 pic.twitter.com/dvrHKoGvEk Five of those have come in the Premier League with a further three in this season's Europa League, but after months of speculation the London-born midfielder has called time on his United career. A statement on the club's official website confirmed the news: "Manchester United can confirm that Angel Gomes has not taken up the offer of a new contract and has, therefore, left the club. "The 19-year-old joined the Reds at a very young age and worked his way through the ranks before becoming the first player born in the 2000s to represent the first team, as a substitute for Wayne Rooney in the final game of the 2016/17 season, against Crystal Palace. "It meant he became the youngest player since Duncan Edwards to make his senior debut for the club, soon after being awarded the Jimmy Murphy Young Player of the Year award. The attacking midfielder made 10 senior appearances in total for the Reds - three of them starts, which all came in this season's Europa League. "His final outing came in the 4-0 defeat of Norwich City at Old Trafford in the Premier League in January. Everybody at Manchester United would like to wish Angel the very best of luck for the future and thank him for his efforts for the club."
