Brentford will not allow David Raya to leave the club this summer if they do not receive an acceptable offer for him and are prepared to let him walk away for free in 2024, sources have told 90min. Raya, whose contract at the Gtech Community Stadium expires at the end of next season, recently revealed he has turned down two fresh offers of a new deal from the Bees, citing ambitions to compete for titles and play in Europe. The Spain international has developed into one of the Premier League's best goalkeepers since Brentford achieved promotion to the top flight in 2021. His progress has not gone unnoticed - 90min previously reported Chelsea, Manchester United, Tottenham and Atletico Madrid are all monitoring Raya ahead of the summer transfer window.

Brentford head coach Thomas Frank recently said he values Raya at around  £40m, though this was a tongue-in-cheek estimation. 90min understands the Bees are likely to accept offers in the  £30m range, which would be a club-record in terms of transfer fees received - Aston Villa paid  £28m for Ollie Watkins in 2020, though this could still yet rise to  £33m. Raya joined Brentford in 2019 from Blackburn Rovers for roughly  £3m. He has since played 147 times for the Bees in all competitions. LISTEN NOW
