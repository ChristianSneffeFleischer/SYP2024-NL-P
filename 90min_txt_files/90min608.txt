Hakim Ziyech's move to Saudi Pro League side Al Nassr is in danger due to a contractual issue, sources have confirmed to 90min. The Moroccan has been deemed surplus to requirements at Stamford Bridge for some time. He came close to joining PSG on an initial loan at the back-end of the January transfer window but the move fell through as the French champions didn't register him by the Ligue 1 deadline. 90min reported earlier in June that Ziyech had agreed terms on a three-year contract at Al Nassr, where he would become a teammate of Cristiano Ronaldo. However, after travelling to Saudi Arabia to finalise the deal, an issue arose during the winger's medical and Al Nassr tried to alter their contract offer. feed The two parties could not come to a new agreement, though 90min understands that Chelsea hope the issue can be resolved and are willing to lower their  Â£8m asking price in order to push the deal through. Ziyech was set to be the third Chelsea player sold to the Saudi Pro League in the last week. Kalidou Koulibaly left for Al Hilal on Sunday, while Edouard Mendy's move to Al Ahli was confirmed on Wednesday. N'Golo Kante will officially join champions Al Ittihad when his contract expires on Saturday, with Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Mason Mount also nearing the Stamford Bridge exit door to join AC Milan and Manchester United respectively.
