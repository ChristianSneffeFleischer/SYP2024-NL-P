Carlos Tevez has hinted that he would love to make a shock return to English football when his current deal with Boca Juniors expires - and he dreams of ending his career back at former club, West Ham United.  The Argentinian striker joined the Hammers in 2006, spending one year in east London before switching to Manchester United at the end of the campaign. The bullish forward is remembered fondly by West Ham supporters for his heroics in their battle against relegation, securing survival on the final day with a goal against the Red Devils at Old Trafford.  That eternal love is something which Tevez still feels to this day, and while speaking to Radio La Red, the 36-year-old confessed that 'only West Ham comes to mind' when considering another adventure in England.  "If I think about retiring in Europe, only West Ham comes to mind. "I won't rule out that after this new contract with Boca Juniors, I can continue my career in West Ham or in the Corinthians. They are two clubs that I also love very much." Tevez's current deal with Boca expires at the end of this season, and he will be free to negotiate a deal with whichever club takes his fancy.  And boy, could the Irons do with a player like him - although perhaps a tad younger. West Ham are in the midst of a relegation dogfight at the bottom of the Premier League, and with 35 goals in 31 matches, David Moyes' men are finding goals hard to come by.
