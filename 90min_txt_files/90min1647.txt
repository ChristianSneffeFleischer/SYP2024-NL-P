Nottingham Forest have finalised the signing of Atletico Madrid centre-back Felipe. The 33-year-old Brazilian ends his spell with Los Rojiblancos after three-and-a-half years to join Forest's quest to avoid relegation from the Premier League. Felipe had been close to joining Wolverhampton Wanderers during the summer as part of the deal that took Matheus Cunha to Molineux, but after talks broke down, he has since joined up with Forest.     It was a dream of mine to play in the Premier League and I   m really excited to be part of this wonderful, fast-growing club," the defender said.    You can see it   s a club looking to really grow. It   s a big challenge for me and I made a clear decision to be part of the history here and grow with the club.    Few clubs have been as active as Forest during the 2022/23 season. The Premier League newcomers brought in 23 players during the summer and have not halted their recruitment this month either.
