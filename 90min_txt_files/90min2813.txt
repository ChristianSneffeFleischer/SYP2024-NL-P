Chelsea are considering making a move for Crystal Palace forward Wilfried Zaha as they bid to bolster their attack before the transfer window closes, 90min understands. The Blues allowed Romelu Lukaku to return to Inter earlier in the summer, with Timo Werner also set to return to his former club RB Leipzig, and are anxious to add to their attacking options having only brought in Raheem Sterling from Premier League champions Manchester City. Chelsea are looking for a central striker but also want to add a wide player, and having already missed out on Raphinha to Barcelona, 90min has learned that they are doing their homework on Ivory Coast international Zaha. Zaha has just 12 months left on his current deal at Selhurst Park and sources close to the player have indicated he would like the chance to play Champions League football     something that eluded him during his brief stint at Manchester United nine years ago. The 29-year-old could now get the chance with a move across London and he is understood to be on the list of co-owner Todd Boehly, who is desperate to give Thomas Tuchel all the options required to mount a title challenge. Palace had been open to discussing a new deal with Zaha     their highest paid player     but realise this summer is the last chance they have to cash in on their star turn. 90min further understands that Palace are interested in a number of Chelsea players who could be included in a deal. As well as an ongoing interest in Conor Gallagher     who was Palace   s Player of the Year during his loan spell last season     they are also one of the sides showing a liking for Callum Hudson-Odoi. Hudson-Odoi is wary his first team chances may be limited under Tuchel and that was confirmed on the opening day of the season when he did not even make the bench for their win at Everton.
