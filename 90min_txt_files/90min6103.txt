Newly-promoted Leeds United have added their name to the growing list of clubs interested in Brentford's Sa  d Benrahma. The Algerian left winger was one of the outstanding players as Brentford booked a playoff final appearance against Fulham, registering 17 goals and eight assists across the Championship season. However, with Brentford having failed to secure promotion at Wembley against the Cottagers, the forward has been linked to a number of Premier League clubs - with the Bees said to be holding out for a fee of around  £25m. While West Ham United, Aston Villa, Crystal Palace and Leicester City have all named as clubs with an existing interest in the wide man, the Telegraph have revealed that Premier League new boys Leeds are also hoping to acquire Benrahma's services. With Marcelo Bielsa looking to bolster the Whites' options up top as they prepare for their first top-flight campaign since their 2004 relegation, Benrahma has emerged as a means of immediately boosting the standard of the Argentine's starting eleven. Though  £25m is the quoted figure, those interested in the winger are optimistic that Brentford could be persuaded to part ways with the forward for under  £20m. Any deal for Benrahma would form part of an already busy summer for the champions of England's second tier, who have seen Illan Meslier and Helder Costa make their existing loan deals at the club permanent. It is hoped that another of Leeds' loanees could end up staying at Elland Road, with the Whites hoping to negotiate a deal with centre-back Ben White's parent club Brighton which would see the defender stay in Yorkshire.
