Manchester United interim manager Ralf Rangnick has said it is    too early    to discuss whether anyone will leave the club in January. But he has admitted he is open to speaking to players on an individual basis if they are concerned about a lack of chances. A number of United players appeared to grow frustrated with their playing time in the final stages of the Ole Gunnar Solskjaer era. That included Donny van de Beek, Jesse Lingard and Eric Bailly, all of whom started in the Champions League against Young Boys in midweek. Anthony Martial is yet to feature under Rangnick because of knee trouble and has only started four games in all competitions this season. A representative has now confirmed the Frenchman wants to leave United when the transfer window opens and talks will soon be held. Speaking to media on Friday, Rangnick discussed his views on the squad ahead of January and said that the most important things is the players want to be at the club.    I   ve got to know them better this week,    he said.    I saw most of them play in the two games and had three, four or five training sessions, but it is still too early to speak about what might happen in the winter transfer window.    If I look at the number of players we have, it   s still a big squad, we definitely don   t have not enough players. We need to make sure that players want to stay here.    If they see not getting enough game time here, it might make sense to speak individually with the players to see if a loan deal might make sense, but right now, it   s still too early to speak about that.
