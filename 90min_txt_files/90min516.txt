Arsenal have confirmed that teen prodigy Ethan Nwaneri is staying with the club, despite attempts from Chelsea to poach him and interest from Manchester United and Manchester City. Nwaneri became the youngest player in Premier League history last September when he made his senior Gunners debut against Brentford at the age of just 15 years and 181 days. But Nwaneri has rejected the advances of Chelsea to continue with Arsenal. 90min reported last month that talks between club and player had progressed to the point where an agreement was in place for him to sign scholarship terms and then a professional contract upon turning 17 next March. Now, Arsenal have confirmed the first stage of that journey, naming Nwaneri among 13 first year scholars for the 2023/24 season. feed The group will train at London Colney, with particular support from Under-18 manager and former Gunners player Jack Wilshere. Head of academy coaching Luke Hobbs and academy manager Per Mertesacker lead the youth setup, with sporting director Edu also offering overall support. "Ethan has been with us for a long time, progressing through Hale End from pre-academy right the way through to London Colney," Arsenal said in their announcement. "He plays mostly as an attacking midfield player and has always scored goals from this position on his development journey. Ethan can dribble, beat defenders and sees the last pass very well. Ethan has represented England at youth level." Bless Akolbire, Jakai Bascoe-Fisher, Dan Casey, Reece Clairmont, Louie Copley, Ayden Heaven, Cam   ron Ismail, Max Kuczynski, Myles Lewis-Skelly, Daniel Oyetunde, Zac Shuaib and Will Sweet are the 12 other players taking their fledgling Arsenal careers to the next level.
