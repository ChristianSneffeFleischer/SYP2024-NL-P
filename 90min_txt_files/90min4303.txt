Fresh off the back of his Scudetto win with Inter, Ashley Young looks set to return to Aston Villa on a free transfer. The 35-year-old's contract with the Nerrazzuri is due to expire at the end of this month and, according to The Telegraph, as of Thursday negotiations are 'moving quickly' and a deal to take him back to Villa Park could be completed 'in the next 24 hours'. Young began his career at Watford, but following his move to the Villans in 2007 he took his game to another level, scoring 37 goals and providing 59 assists in 190 appearances in the Midlands. His performances in the claret and blue caught the eye of Sir Alex Ferguson and Manchester United swooped in to take him to Old Trafford in 2011. A Premier League winner with the Red Devils, even in the twilight of his career Young proved himself to be a valuable member of Antonio Conte's title-winning squad - making 26 appearances last season in Milan. His excellent physical condition despite his age will have certainly been a factor in Dean Smith's decision to pursue a deal for him, as well as the vast experience he'll undoubtedly bring to the group with the deal edging closer.
