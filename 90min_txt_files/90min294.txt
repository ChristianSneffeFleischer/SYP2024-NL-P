Manchester United are set to receive a  Â£15m fee from Nottingham Forest for Swedish winger Anthony Elanga, 90min understands. A deal was agreed between the two Premier League clubs on Friday, with the 21-year-old set to undergo a medical with Forest over the weekend. Forest are also working on a transfer for United goalkeeper Dean Henderson, who spent last season on loan at the City Ground. United are working on the sales of a number of fringe players to fund their desired transfer business for the summer, having spent a large chunk of their existing budget on the arrivals of Mason Mount from Chelsea, and Inter goalkeeper Andre Onana. feed Onana's arrival at United was confirmed on Thursday, and he has flown to the United States to join up with the club on their pre-season tour. Elanga himself is present in New York but is expected to say his goodbyes and leave the club in the coming days. Elanga was the subject of interest from a number of clubs and it's understood he has turned down the options of moving to Everton, who are proceeding with a deal for Arnaut Danjuma instead, and other clubs such as West Ham United. Initially joining United as a youngster in 2014, Elanga made his debut for the club in May 2021, and had a prolonged spell of matches in the team under former interim coach Ralf Rangnick. Current boss Erik ten Hag has however preferred the use of the likes of Antony, Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho in wide positions since his appointment over a year ago. Elanga only managed 418 Premier League minutes for United last season.
