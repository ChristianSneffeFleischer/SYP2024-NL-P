Fulham have announced the arrival of former Arsenal and Chelsea winger Willian on a free transfer following his recent departure from Brazilian club Corinthians. The veteran, who has won two Premier League titles in his career, has agreed a one-year contract.    I   m happy to be here, I   m happy to be back in the Premier League," he said.    Fulham is a special club, a club that wants to improve, that wants to fight for something bigger, so I   m here to help, and I cant wait to get started.    Owner Tony Khan added:    I   m very happy that Willian has officially signed with Fulham.  He   s been impressive during his recent training sessions with our squad, and we believe that adding a player of Willian   s quality and someone with his vast experience will strengthen the Club as we work to build on the strong start that we   ve had to this Premier League season!     Come on Fulham!     Willian, now 34, has been training with Fulham in recent weeks and suggested earlier this month it is his    goal    to live in London again. The former Brazil international famously adores the city he called home from 2013 to 2021 and actually even has British citizenship after taking test multiple times. Willian made 339 appearances for Chelsea and a further 37 for Arsenal. He returned to first club Corinthians following his release by the Gunners last year, but things soured and he cited abuse and threats of he and his family when he left by mutual consent.
