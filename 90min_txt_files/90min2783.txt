Leicester City manager Brendan Rodgers has confirmed the club intend to offer veteran striker Jamie Vardy a new contract. The 35-year-old has achieved legendary status at King Power Stadium after helping the club win the Premier League and FA Cup over the past decade, and he's continued to perform at the highest level despite his advancing years - he scored 17 goals in all competitions last season. Vardy's current Leicester contract expires next summer, and 90min understands that a number of clubs - including Chelsea and Manchester United - have been monitoring his situation with talks over a new deal yet to get underway. But Rodgers has confirmed that Leicester intend to begin negotiations with Vardy's representatives, in the hope that he'll extend his stay in the east Midlands into a 12th season. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  &  Sean Walsh  bring you Talking Transfers, discussing Man Utd's transfer market implosion in targeting deals for Adrien Rabiot & Marko Arnautovic, Man City's stance on selling Bernardo Silva to Barcelona, Wilfried Zaha's future and more. Available on  all audio platforms  and the  90min YouTube channel. If you can't see the podcast embed, click  here  to download the episode in full! "He has looked good in pre-season and is continuing to work," Rodgers said. "His appetite is still there. We would like to extend his stay here and that's something the club and his representatives will look at. "Jamie thrives on balls into space behind the defence and if there is no space, he thrives on low crosses into the box. It is as simple as that. If we can do that more, there will be opportunities for him and other players."
