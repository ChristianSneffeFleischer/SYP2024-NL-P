Amid the injury crisis in central defence, Liverpool have been linked with a number of centre backs ahead of the January transfer window.   Included in those players is 21-year old Ajax defender Perr Schuurs, who has impressed at the Dutch club this campaign. It was previously reported that Liverpool had submitted a    30m bid for the centre back. However, new reports from Italy suggest that the club's interest in Schuurs isn't as explicit as first though, and that no such bid has been received by Ajax.  It has been reported by Corriere dello Sport, via Voetbalprimeur, that Ajax aren't too worried about the young centre back's departure, and they suggest that the club's director of football, Marc Overmars, has not yet received an offer for the player.  Corriere dello Sport's podcast was told: "It's going to be worth    30m. If Marc Overmars gets the chance, I think he will do it immediately. I checked at Ajax and there is no concrete interest from Liverpool...he's on a list, but there's 50 players on it." Names among the list of players previously linked with the Premier League champions include Ozan Kabak (Schalke), Pau Torres (Villarreal), Mykola Matviyenko (Shakhtar Donetsk), Dayot Upamecano (RB Leipzig) and of course, Schuurs.
