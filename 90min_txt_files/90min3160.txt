Manchester United will allow Cristiano Ronaldo to leave Old Trafford this summer and they are expecting an offer from Premier League rivals Chelsea in the near future, 90min understands. United's hierarchy and manager Erik ten Hag were understood to be shocked when Ronaldo and his agent Jorge Mendes told them earlier this month that he would like to leave this summer. Ten Hag had been planning for Ronaldo to be central to his plans for the coming season, but after considering his options following the end of the last campaign - the 37-year-old believes his future would be best served elsewhere. Ronaldo returned to United less than a year ago from Juventus, scoring 24 goals in all competitions in his first season back at Old Trafford. The player believes that showed that he can rub shoulders with the world's best - but he does not feel that United will be challenging for major honours next season. The fact United failed to qualify for the Champions League has also impacted on Ronaldo's decision, and 90min now understands that United have made it clear that he will be allowed to leave despite having one year left on his current contract. Jorge Mendes is now working on options for the player and we understand that Chelsea are ready to firm up their interest and lodge a bid. It is believed United will allow Ronaldo to leave for a relatively modest fee of around  £15m, but any club signing him would have to take on his wages of over  £400,000-a-week - although Mendes has told interested parties he would take a pay cut. Sources close to Chelsea insist that co-owner Todd Boehly, who is also interim sporting director, sees the chance of landing one of the biggest names in world sport too good an opportunity to turn down.
