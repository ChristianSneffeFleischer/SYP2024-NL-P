Departing Manchester City great David Silva is edging closer to signing for Lazio as negotiations continue to take positive strides.  The Spaniard spent almost the entirety of the 2010s in Manchester following his move from Valencia in the summer of 2010. He secured four Premier League titles during his spell at the Etihad, registering 217 goal contributions in 434 total appearances along the way. But a new challenge awaits the soon-to-be free agent following the conclusion of City's Champions League campaign - which resumes against Real Madrid on Friday night. Silva has been linked with moves to Las Palmas - due to his desire to represent his boyhood club - and David Beckham's Inter Miami, while the midfielder's also said to have received a pair of 'attractive' offers from the Middle East. However, it appears that Simone Inzaghi's Lazio have won the race for the City playmaker.  After recently opening negotiations for the World Cup-winner, Sky Sport Italia reporter Gianluca Di Marzio now understands the 34-year-old is closing in on a move to the Biancocelesti, with the Italian club growing increasingly confident that a deal can be struck.  Tuttosport, meanwhile, reports that the player has been offered a three-year deal at the club worth  Â£52,000-a-week.  The Spaniard is understood to be a specifically requested target by manager Inzaghi, as the Italian boss sets about building a squad capable of knocking Juventus off their perch after the Bianconeri secured their ninth Scudetto on the bounce last season despite looking unconvincing for the most part.  Lazio, though, looked set to finally end Juve's reign of supremacy before the unprecedented break in March. They eventually slumped to fourth as a result of the break completely halting their momentum and their woeful injury record following calcio's resumption in June.
