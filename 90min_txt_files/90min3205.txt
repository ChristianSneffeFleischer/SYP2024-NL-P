However, he added that Bar  a keeping the 25-year-old will hinge on negotiating a lower salart.    I am going to do what is in my power to that  Frenkie  stays but it is also a salary issue and it would have to be adjusted,    the president said, via Mundo Deportivo. Laporta went on to claim that Manchester United are not the only club interested in De Jong.    He is a  Bar  a  player, one of the best in the world in his position, according to the experts. We know that there are clubs that want him, not just  Manchester United  , and we have no intention of selling,    the president defiantly said.    We know that he wants to stay and the criteria of the player is very important. He is comfortable in Barcelona and as little as we can, I would do everything I can to make him stay.
