Chelsea duo Reece James and Mason Mount are in line for new contracts at Stamford Bridge, 90min understands. New Blues owner Todd Boehly is understood to see James and Mount as arguably the two most important players at Chelsea and is keen to build the team around the two homegrown stars for years to come. The two remain on contracts they signed early into their breakthroughs at Stamford Bridge and are among the lower earners in the squad, but sources have confirmed to 90min that will likely not be the case for much longer. Both James and Mount were approached during the summer about new contracts and accepted it would be better to wait until the closure of the transfer window, allowing Chelsea to focus on other business in the meantime. With the deadline now passed, Chelsea are set to reignite talks with the England internationals and the pair are in line for new six-year contracts which would make them two of the highest-earning English players in the Premier League. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey,Toby Cudworth  and  Harry Symeou  bring you a live deadline day edition of Talking Transfers. The team welcome  Daniel Childs  and  Julien Laurens  to the show to discuss Chelsea's late window activity, Arsenal's pursuit of Douglas Luiz, Paris Saint-Germain's summer signings & much more! The show is also available on all  audio platforms. While there is no immediate rush in negotiations - Mount's contract expires in 2024 and James' in 2025 - Boehly is keen to reward the duo for their emergence as key players for club and country and agrees that sizeable pay rises are more than deserved. Chelsea are hopeful that negotiations with James and Mount will be finalised before they depart for the World Cup with England in November.
