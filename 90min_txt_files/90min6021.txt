Brighton are determined to keep hold of centre-backs Lewis Dunk and Ben White, amid significant Premier League interest in the defensive duo.  Dunk has missed just four Premier League games for the Seagulls since they secured promotion to the top flight in 2017, regularly racking up impressive defensive stats along the way. Chelsea and Tottenham are both on the lookout for defensive reinforcements and had earmarked the 28-year-old as a potential recruit.  However, according to talkSPORT 'transfer insider' Alex Crook, Brighton are unlikely to part with the one-cap England international this summer. "I   ve spoken to people very close to the player and spoken to my sources at Brighton," he said. "They haven   t received a bid from Chelsea, and they wouldn   t welcome one. Lewis Dunk is happy on the south coast and I   m told he   s 95 percent certain to stay a Seagulls player." Dunk is not the only Brighton defender to be linked with a move away from the south coast recently with Ben White also attracting interest. The 22-year-old impressed on loan at Leeds United last season with the Whites attempting to make the move permanent with a series of bids earlier this month.  As with Dunk, Brighton are putting on a public front of defiance as they look to keep hold of the young talent.   300        ?

"He is expected to stay."
