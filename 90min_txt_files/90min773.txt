Borussia Dortmund are close to finalising a deal with Ajax for Mexican midfielder Edson Alvarez, 90min understands. Dortmund made a move for Alvarez last month, but talks stalled and interest emerged from Europa League winners West Ham United, who are long-term admirers. The Hammers held talks as they saw him as potential replacement for captain Declan Rice, who is set to leave this summer. However, Alvarez has made it clear to Ajax that he has his heart set on a move to the Ruhr Valley this summer where he is set to replace Jude Bellingham, who signed for Real Madrid earlier this month. Alvarez, who was the subject of bids from Chelsea and Newcastle last summer, has already agreed personal terms in principle with Dortmund, and they are now locked in talks with Ajax. Dortmund's latest bid is    35m plus bonuses - a club-record offer - but that is still short of Ajax's    45m asking price. feed While a deal is not yet agreed, sources close to Ajax do not anticipate Alvarez returning to the club and the player has already confirmed his desire to move. "I spent four wonderful years here and this place still feels like home to me. I won a lot of trophies and developed. This is what could make it the right time to take the next step in my career. But everything has to be perfect. I have to improve, but so do Ajax,"  Alvarez recently said. "Of course it's nice when you are linked with a big club, but Ajax is also a big club. So I will always show respect to everyone in and around Amsterdam. I am very grateful to everyone here."
