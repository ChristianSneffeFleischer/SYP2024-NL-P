Atletico Madrid have confirmed the signing of Geoffrey Kondogbia from Valencia, with the midfielder putting pen to paper on a four-year deal. With Thomas Partey joining Arsenal, Diego Simeone was looking to bring in a replacement and the club were given special dispensation from La Liga to complete a deal for someone outside of the transfer window. ?    #WelcomeKondogbiaAgreement with @valenciacf_en over the transfer of Geoffrey Kondogbia.

The club have now confirmed the arrival of the 27-year-old on their official website after he successfully passed his medical examinations and signed a four-year deal. It's said Atleti have paid in the region of    15m-   20m for Kondogbia. While La Liga granted permission to Los Che to sign a midfielder despite the fact the window is no longer open, as part of the conditions, the new recruit had to be either playing for another top flight club in Spain or currently a free agent.  Of course, this will have limited Simeone's options somewhat, but the club have decided to conclude a deal for Kondogbia before the 5th November deadline. ?    #WelcomeKondogbia    Geoffrey Kondogbia passed his medical at @ClinicaNavarra before signing his contract as a new Red & White player ??? #A  paAtleti pic.twitter.com/kTsOwEXx88
