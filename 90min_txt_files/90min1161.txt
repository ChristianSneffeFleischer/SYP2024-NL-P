Barcelona remain confident of finalising a deal to sign Ilkay Gundogan during the summer transfer window, 90min understands. The Man City captain has been in stunning form for his club this season, scoring seven goals and bagging three assists in all competitions.  Gundogan bagged himself two goals in the weekend win over Leeds United at the Etihad Stadium and, speaking after the game to the press, Pep Guardiola pleaded with the German to commit his future to the Citizens. He said: "I said about the contract, the club is involved and knows my opinion. They are above me, we take the decision together, good and bad. It's not necessary if he scored two incredible goals, how good he played today, reading the spaces, he has everything     incredible run in the final third, how intelligent he is. feed "It's not necessary to score two goals to know exactly how I like this player and enjoying working with him and how I'd like to work with him in the future." The midfielder's current deal at the Etihad Stadium expires in June and, despite Guardiola's pleas, 90min understands Gundogan is currently edging towards a move to Barcelona.  Sources have confirmed the former Borussia Dortmund midfielder has been offered a two-year deal at Camp Nou, with an option for a further year, and the player's family are keen to live in Spain.
