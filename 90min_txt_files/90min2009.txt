Arsenal have triggered 12-month extension clauses in the contracts of Bukayo Saka and William Saliba, 90min can confirm. Both players had been approaching the final six months of their respective deals but Arsenal were always prepared to activate their extension clauses if they failed to wrap up new contracts before the turn of the year. Sources have confirmed to 90min both players are now contracted until 2024 and there is now no possibility of either Saka or Saliba leaving for free next summer. Arsenal are continuing talks with both players in the hope of tying them down to bumper new deals but 90min understands negotiations have not yet made the sort of progress the Gunners were looking for.
