Barcelona winger Ferran Torres has vowed to stay and fight for his future at Camp Nou after a summer full of significant transfer speculation. Torres, a    55m signing from Manchester City in January 2022, has managed 14 goals in 71 games for the Blaugrana and actually played fewer La Liga minutes last season than during his first six months at the club, despite making 15 more appearances. Indeed, Torres started just 14 times for Xavi's side last season, with the likes of Raphinha and Ousmane Dembele well ahead in the pecking order. With Barcelona needing to raise money this summer, Torres has been touted as a likely casualty but, as 90min reported last month, the 23-year-old is not interested in a move away. "The rumours are put there by journalists. I have a contract here, I'm going to stay," Torres told the media. feed "I have it clear in my head, I am qualified to play for Bar  a. What is said about me doesn't matter to me. I have to be calm with myself and work as hard as possible because, in the end, the reward always arrives." Torres did, however, acknowledge the need to improve after an underwhelming individual campaign. "I am my first critic," he confessed. "Last season was not good but it is one of the ones I have learned the most from in my career. Those ups and downs I had are helping me to be stronger now." One potential avenue for more minutes would be a move to a central striker to offer cover for 34-year-old Robert Lewandowski who, until Vitor Roque arrives next year, is the only natural in the position in Xavi's squad. "The more versatility I have, the more options there are to play," Torres added. "I can play on both wings, forward or second striker. It's good for me and for the team."
