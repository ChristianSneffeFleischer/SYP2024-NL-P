Napoli centre-back Kalidou Koulibaly has confirmed a move to Chelsea is 'on the right track'. 90min understands the Blues are growing increasingly confident of signing the Napoli man. Koulibaly is keen to make the move and the Partonopei are unwilling to do business with Serie A rivals Juventus, who are also interested. Chelsea are on the hunt for a number of defensive reinforcements following the departures of both Antonio Rudiger and Andreas Christensen at the end of their respective contracts. First-choice Matthijs de Ligt has drifted out of reach as he nears a move to Bayern Munich, although the west Londoners retain an interest in long-term target Jules Kounde and Paris Saint-Germain defender Presnel Kimpembe. However, 31-year-old Koulibaly has always been an option and Chelsea have now made their move, advancing talks with notoriously tough negotiators Napoli. The player himself was asked on Tuesday how the deal was progressing by French journalist Romain Collet-Gaudin. "I'll confirm that later, but it's on the right track," he responded. Having joined Napoli way back in 2014, Koulibaly has entered the final year of his contract and is now set for a new challenge in a fresh chapter of his career.
