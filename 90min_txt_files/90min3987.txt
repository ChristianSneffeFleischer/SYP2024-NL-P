Barcelona midfielder Miralem Pjanic is set to rejoin former club Juventus this summer on a season-long loan. The Catalan giants are in desperate need of cutting salaries from the current wage bill and Pjanic has long been earmarked among a number of players worth sacrificing. Bar  a have already been forced to admit defeat in their hopes of finalising a new contract with Lionel Messi, despite agreeing terms with the six-time Ballon d   Or winner, as even him hypothetically playing for free wouldn   t have helped them comply with La Liga salary rules. Bosnian international Pjanic only arrived at Camp Nou last summer as part of a deal involving Arthur that helped temporarily delay the financial catastrophe the club now finds itself embroiled in, yet a swift exit is in the immediate best interests of the debt-ridden giants. Local publication SPORT reports that Bar  a are only    one step away    from finalising a deal for Pjanic to go back to Juventus on loan, with the option of a second season on loan until 2023. It is believed that Pjanic has agreed to a 20% pay cut, which will ensure that Juve remain in compliance with UEFA   s Financial Fair Play regulations. The proposed transfer is said to be in the final stages of completion, ahead of an expected official announcement. Barcelona fans have made their feelings about Pjanic crystal clear. The 31-year-old was among a handful of Bar  a players subjected to jeering and booing from the crowd at this year   s annual Joan Gamper Trophy match over the weekend, ironically against Juventus.
