Juventus have informed Chelsea that they would be open to receiving Christian Pulisic as a makeweight in any bid for centre-back Matthijs de Ligt, 90min understands. New Blues owner Todd Boehly is willing to sanction Thomas Tuchel's rejig of the squad this summer and De Ligt has now emerged as their top defensive target. The Dutchman has failed to agree the terms of an extension at Juventus and is understood to be interested in speaking with Chelsea. Juventus are reluctant to lose De Ligt but acknowledge that a lucrative sale could be too good to turn down. A fee of    100m has been suggested, and although Chelsea have not met that figure yet, 90min understands Boehly has indicated a willingness to discuss further. To try and sweeten the deal, Boehly has offered a host of players to Juve, who were initially hoping for a cash-only offer, but sources have confirmed to 90min that the Bianconeri would be interested in receiving Pulisic in exchange. Chelsea are open to offloading Pulisic this summer and have also indicated that Timo Werner is available in discussions as well. Juve are interested in both but Pulisic is understood to be their preferred option. Juventus have confirmed they are open to a swap deal and a bid from Chelsea is expected to arrive in the coming days, but the Blues may end up pursuing a cash-only deal if the two teams cannot agree on the valuations of any of the makeweights. Those in charge at the Allianz Stadium are already looking for potential replacements for De Ligt and have a list of potential targets which includes Napoli's Kalidou Koulibaly, Torino's Gleison Bremer and Presnel Kimpembe of PSG. That trio of centre-backs have also been linked to Chelsea as the Blues look to bring in at least two new defenders this summer.
