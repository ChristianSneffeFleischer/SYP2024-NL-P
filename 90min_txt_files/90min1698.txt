Nottingham Forest have failed with an attempt to convince Bayer Leverkusen to part ways with centre-back Jonathan Tah, 90min understands. Forest have been incredibly active in the transfer market since their promotion to the Premier League last summer and have continued their aggressive recruitment push in the January window, aiming even higher for some ambitious targets. Talks remain on with Paris Saint-Germain over the short-term signing of goalkeeper Keylor Navas, who has been targeted following an injury to current starter Dean Henderson. Now, sources have confirmed to 90min that Forest have attempted to lure 26-year-old Tah away from Bayer Leverkusen. Unfortunately for Forest, Leverkusen boss Xabi Alonso has no desire to weaken his squad midway through their season and the Bundesliga side have turned away Forest's approach. Listen now as  Scott Saunders  hosts  Graeme Bailey  and  Toby Cudworth  to discuss the latest transfer news. On today's agenda: Dusan Vlahovic, Anthony Gordon, Enzo Fernandes, Amadou Onana, Malo Gusto, Nicolo Zaniolo, Pedro Porro, Weston McKennie, Milan Skriniar, Maiximo Perrone & more!
