Arsenal are reportedly interested in Espanyol midfielder Marc Roca despite emerging interest from Everton and Milan.  The 23-year-old old has been a rare bright spot in an otherwise dismal season for Abelardo Fern  ndez's side. Espanyol are currently rooted to the bottom of the La Liga table, six points from safety with 11 games left to play.  Despite his team's plight, Mikel Arteta is understood to be a big fan of the defensive midfielder and is interested in bringing him to the Emirates Stadium in the summer.  According to Spanish source La Razon, Arsenal are leading the race for Roca's signature and they could get a cut-price deal. His current deal expires in 2022 and Espanyol may be tempted to let him depart for less than his    40m ( Â£35.6m) release clause if they are relegated. Despite the Gunners' strong interest, Everton are understood to be monitoring the situation closely while Milan are also ready to rival Arsenal for his services. Bayern Munich were chasing the Spaniard last summer, only for the deal to fall through at the last minute with a transfer fee agreed.  The Top ?
