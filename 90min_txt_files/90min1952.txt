Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti has talked up Jude Bellingham's abilities amid their interest in the midfielder. 90min reported on Friday that Real Madrid, Liverpool and Manchester City are satisfied with the pitches they've made to the England international, who is expected to inform Borussia Dortmund of his preferred summer destination in the coming weeks. Los Blancos are currently in the process of rejuvenating their squad with the world's best young talent. France midfielder Aurelien Tchouameni opted to join Real Madrid over Liverpool last summer, while the European champions recently sealed a deal to sign Brazilian starlet Endrick once he turns 18 in 2024. Ancelotti was asked for his thoughts on Bellingham ahead of Real Madrid's La Liga clash with Villarreal on Saturday. "He showed what a great midfielder he is at the World Cup, like others, Enzo Fernandez, Pedri, Gavi," the Italian coach replied. "There are a lot of young midfielders coming through and he is one of them. I'm happy with my midfielders: Tchouameni, [Eduardo] Camavinga, [Fede] Valverde."
