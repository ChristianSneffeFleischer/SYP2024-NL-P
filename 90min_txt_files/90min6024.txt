Manchester United are 'keeping tabs' on Juventus winger Douglas Costa as a potential alternative to Jadon Sancho this summer, should they opt against completing a deal for the Englishman. United's interest in Sancho has been the worst kept secret in football as of late and seems to be the big money transfer saga of the summer, despite the financial strain of the ongoing global pandemic.

Sancho remains United's number one target, but should the deal not commence, the Red Devils are prepared to move towards other targets such as the Brazilian. Juventus are keen to move 29-year-old Costa on this summer, according to Sky Italy's Gianluca Di Marzio, which is where the interest seems to have stemmed from. Di Marzio reports that Costa's agents have been in contact with United, to see if there is interest in a deal being done. While Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side are still yet to launch a formal offer for the England international, it is expected that a deal can still be done. 90min learned in May that United were intent on signing Sancho this summer amid the pandemic, but not willing to spend over  £100m in doing so. Sancho has already agreed personal terms with United, but the club are yet to launch a formal bid. Sky Sports also report that Dortmund value Sancho at  £108m despite insisting he isn't for sale, with United missing the supposed 'deadline' of 10th August to sign the winger.
