Eintracht Frankfurt goalkeeper Kevin Trapp has decided to stay with last season's Europa League winners despite receiving an offer from Manchester United. The 32-year-old was targeted by United as they look to bring in a new understudy for David de Gea, with veteran goalkeeper Tom Heaton the only current alternative at Old Trafford. The Red Devils have also been linked with Borussia Monchengladbach's Yann Sommer and Newcastle's Martin Dubravka, who 90min confirmed United's revived interest in, but Trapp was identified as a possible  target earlier in the week. The club has also been keeping an eye on Alex McCarthy, Yann Sommer and Asmir Begovic. A four-year contract offer is thought to have been presented to Trapp, who joined Frankfurt from Paris Saint-Germain in 2019, but the Bundesliga side intimated from the beginning that they had no interest in negotiating a transfer. Trapp admitted he was flattered by United's interest at the SportBild awards on Tuesday, but he has now moved to clarify his future plans.
