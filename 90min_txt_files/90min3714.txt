Manchester United are believed to be keeping tabs on Marseille midfielder Boubacar Kamara, who is set to be available on a free transfer at the end of the season. Kamara made the breakthrough into the Marseille first-team in 2018 while still a teenager. He was initially a centre-back but made the permanent transition into a holding midfield role in early 2020 and has been a key member of an ambitious side determined to get back into the Champions League. United were interested in several central midfielders during the summer, with Ruben Neves, Eduardo Camavinga and Yves Bissouma all options considered. As it was, capturing Jadon Sancho, Raphael Varane and Cristiano Ronaldo in other positions ensured there was no approach. 90min recently confirmed that the Old Trafford club remain in the market for a new midfielder in 2022. Declan Rice is a player United have admired for over two years, while Jude Bellingham and Kalvin Phillips are being extensively scouted. Monaco starlet Aurelien Tchouameni, who has made the step up to the France national team this season, is another player United have been paying close attention to. The Athletic now adds that United are monitoring Kamara   s situation as another possible option. The 22-year-old is said to be attracting interest from Bayern Munich and Barcelona and previously rejected deadline day moves to Newcastle and Wolves in the summer.
