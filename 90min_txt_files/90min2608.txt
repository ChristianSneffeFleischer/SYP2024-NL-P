Carlo Ancelotti has confirmed that Real Madrid will not look to sign a replacement for Marco Asensio if the winger leaves the club. The boss recently revealed that Asensio is exploring his options after accepting that his role at the Santiago Bernabeu has changed, with a handful of sides all across Europe linked with the 26-year-old. Ahead of Asensio in the pecking order are Vinicius Junior, Eden Hazard, Rodrygo and midfielder Federico Valverde, who has established himself as a favourite of Ancelotti out on Asensio's preferred right wing. With all those options at his disposal, Ancelotti has admitted that Real have no need to replace Asensio if he does leave. "[If Asensio leaves] I'm counting on Mariano, but he has the best in the world in that position ahead of him and it's difficult for him," the boss said. "We have a squad in which we have a lot of resources. If Marco leaves we're not going to sign anyone because we don't need them."
