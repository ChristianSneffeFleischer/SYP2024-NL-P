Real Sociedad have announced the signing of former Manchester City playmaker David Silva, after the Spaniard called time on his glittering 10-year stint at the Etihad. Silva won every domestic trophy going during his decade in England and was an integral part of the City side that transformed into a Premier League powerhouse, scoring 77 goals in over 400 appearances.

It will be the first time that Silva - who is to be honoured with a statue outside the Etihad Stadium - has played in his native Spain since leaving Valencia for Manchester City back in 2010. Prior to the shock confirmation of his transfer to Real Sociedad, Silva had been tipped to complete a move to Serie A side Lazio following City's exit from the Champions League at the hands of Lyon. However, reports emerged at the weekend that a communication breakdown between Silva and the Roman club had left the move on the brink of collapse. Real Sociedad hijacked David Silva deal!
