Valencia goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili's agents were in England last week in order to hold talks with a number of Premier League clubs, 90min understands.  Mamardashvili has been Valencia's first choice goalkeeper in what's been a disastrous season for the club. The former La Liga heavyweights currently sit on the brink of relegation, and are two points adrift of Real Valladolid in 17th-place in the table heading into the final 10 games of the season.  Despite their league form, the 22-year-old has put in some solid performances since arriving in 2021 on an initial loan deal which was made permament in the summer of 2022.  These performances have seen Mamardashvili attract interest from a number of clubs, particularly in the Premier League. Sources have confirmed to 90min that the goalkeeper's representatives were in England last week to speak to Chelsea, Tottenham, Manchester United and Leicester, with the latter notably retaining the strongest interest in the player.  READ MORE FROM THE 90MIN TALKING TRANSFERS TEAM feed Atletico Madrid, Monaco and AC Milan all also retain an interest in the goalkeeper, but all interest is dependent upon what happens with each clubs' current number one. Atleti could be set to move on from Jan Oblak this summer, Monaco are set to lose Alexander Nubel back to Bayern Munich at the end of his loan deal, and Milan may need a new goalkeeper if Mike Maignan decides to leave. The Georgian international is keen to leave Valencia this summer and 90min understands that the club will not stand in the player's way.  Valencia are touted to want  Â£30m for Mamardashvili, but may ask for more from a La Liga club.
