Eric Dier has insisted he isn't 'bothered' by Bayern Munich's public appreciation of Tottenham teammate Harry Kane and that it's 'normal' for him to be in the headlines in this manner. The German champions have been linked with a move for the England captain in recent weeks and manager Julian Nagelsmann discussed a potential transfer earlier this weekend, though admitted Spurs' asking price would likely be too high for a deal to transpire. This public courting of Kane infuriated Tottenham head coach Antonio Conte, who branded Bayern's behaviour as 'disrespectful'. But Dier understands that Kane's 'world class' ability means that he is going to be talked about in such conversations. Listen now to 90min's Talking Transfers podcast, with  Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  &  Toby Cudworth. On the latest show they discuss Chelsea finally closing in on Jules Kounde, Man Utd's ongoing pursuit of Frenkie de Jong, West Ham's hunt for a new forward and left-back and more.
