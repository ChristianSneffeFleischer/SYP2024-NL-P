Graham Potter is keen on reuniting with Leandro Trossard at Chelsea, while the Seagulls' former sporting director Dan Ashworth also wants to bring the Belgian to Newcastle, 90min understands. Trossard has a contract at Brighton running until 2024, and while the club want to tie him down to a new deal, he isn't short of suitors. Potter, who utilised Trossard in a number of different roles during his time at the Amex Stadium, wants to bring the versatile winger to Stamford Bridge having previously signed him from Genk in 2019. However, 90min also understands that Brighton   s former sporting director Ashworth, now in charge at Newcastle, is also taking a keen interest in how contract talks on the south coast are progressing. Newcastle are working hard on future targets, but Ashworth is already fully aware of Trossard's talent, and the fact he could be available for a cut-price deal is a big appeal. Trossard is enjoying an outstanding campaign for the Seagulls with five goals and an assist to his name already, following on from last term when he scored eight times with three further assists. He is set to head to this winter's World Cup with Belgium, too. Brighton recognise the progress that has been made by Trossard since he joined and they are desperate to tie him to a more lucrative contract. Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  and  Toby Cudworth  are joined by  Tom Gott  in the latest episode of Talking Transfers. The team discuss Erling Haaland's Manchester City release clause, Mason Mount's future at Chelsea and their sporting director plans, and what the future could hold for 700-goal Cristiano Ronaldo at Man Utd.
