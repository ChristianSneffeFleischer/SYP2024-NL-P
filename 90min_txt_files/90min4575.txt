Lucas Torreira has revealed he has no intentions of returning to Arsenal following the expiration of his loan move to Atletico Madrid and instead wants to move to Boca Juniors. The Uruguayan took part in a candid interview in which he discussed the recent death of his mother due to coronavirus.  The 25-year-old was granted special dispensation from Atletico to fly home following the news and he's now confirmed he has no intentions of playing in Europe beyond the end of this season, with a transfer to Boca Juniors his preferred move. "I always said that I wanted to play in Boca," he said as reported by Marca. "I am dying to play in Boca and I will always say it. Not only for my moment. But it is now, it is in June and I always wanted to play in Boca. I'm dying to play in Boca. "The night my mother died and one of the first to receive the news was my representative. I don't want to play in Europe anymore, I want to play in Boca." Despite clearly not wanting to extend his stay with Atleti, Torreira was full of praise for the La Liga outfit where he's currently playing on loan from Arsenal, and he applauded boss Diego Simeone for showing compassion in the decision to let him fly home. "I asked for a license at Atl  tico de Madrid, Cholo [Diego Simeone] understood everything and they gave me a week, but I asked to stay a little longer," he added. "On Sunday I'm probably traveling. I have to do my duty and life must continue. Atl  tico was very good to me and it's important."
