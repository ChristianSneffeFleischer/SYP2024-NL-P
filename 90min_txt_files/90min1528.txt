World Cup star Josko Gvardiol has admitted he was disappointed with RB Leipzig's decision to block his move to Chelsea in the summer.  The talented young defender was heavily linked with a move to big-spending Chelsea during the 2022 summer transfer window, but a move never materialised.  In an interview with The Times, Gvardiol has revealed just how close he got to a move to Stamford Bridge and revealed his disappointment at said move not coming to fruition:  "I was really confused because one month before the window starts I was upstairs with the sporting director and he says,    Yeah Josko, we are not going to sell you, we need you, we believe in you,    and I was like ok I am fine with this, I can stay here, I like it here, all I need is to work on myself, to play, to win something else. It was like this until the last two days.    My agent called me and said that Chelsea is extremely interested and, of course, you definitely think about a serious offer from a huge club like Chelsea. Leipzig said they didn   t want to sell me. In the end I really struggled with that decision but we didn   t make an agreement.
