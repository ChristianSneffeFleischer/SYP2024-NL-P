I want to focus entirely on the title race." Kudus also opened up about his failed move to Everton last summer, stating that Ajax's decision to block the move turned out to be a blessing in disguise. "The fact that Ajax blocked a transfer to Everton last summer disappointed me. I thought it was time for a new chapter in my career, because I wasn't playing here. But the moment the transfer market closed, my full focus was back on Ajax. The only reason I wanted to leave before that was because of my reserve role. "I eliminated that problem myself. Everton are not doing well in the Premier League, Ajax are in the title race and under  John Heitinga  I am a permanent fixture. I have a strong faith in God and he has made the positive decision for me not to let the transfer go through."
