Porto president Pinto da Costa has confirmed that the club have rejected a bid for Vitinha this summer and will only let the midfielder depart if his release clause is met. After returning from an uneventful loan spell at Wolves during the 2020/21 campaign, the 22-year-old performed much better last season, helping his side win the domestic double.  Last term he racked up 47 appearances in all competitions, featuring in each of Porto's UEFA Champions League group games.  90min understands that his performances have attracted plenty of interest from the Premier League with Manchester United, Arsenal, West Ham, Leeds, Everton and Newcastle all monitoring the situation.  One club has even made the first move by submitting an initial bid for the midfielder, according to Da Costa.
