A number of top sides from across Europe are weighing up moves for Eintracht Frankfurt attacking midfielder Daichi Kamada, sources have confirmed to 90min. Kamada, one of Frankfurt's leading stars in their run to Europa League glory last season, is out of contract at the end of the season and is now able to discuss a free transfer abroad. 90min understands that various clubs are monitoring the situation and weighing up whether to make the Japan international an offer. There is strong interest in Kamada from the Premier League, with Liverpool, Manchester City, Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur all keeping tabs on him. Kamada notably played well and scored against Spurs in this season's Champions League. European heavyweights Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain have also been keeping a close eye on his development, while Kamada is also admired by Frankfurt's Bundesliga rivals Borussia Dortmund.
