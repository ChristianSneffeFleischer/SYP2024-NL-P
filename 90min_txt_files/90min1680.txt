Arsenal have launched a world-record bid for Manchester United striker Alessia Russo. The England international's current United contract expires in the summer of 2023, with manager Marc Skinner stating earlier this month that the club are in 'heavy' talks over a new deal. Arsenal boss Jonas Eidevall has previously admitted that the Gunners are looking to secure the services of a prolific goalscorer during the January transfer window, after forwards Vivianne Miedema and Beth Mead both suffered ACL injuries prior to the winter break, and it appears his attention has turned towards United striker Russo. The Athletic report that a world-record bid has been lodged for Russo by Arsenal, though it has not yet been accepted or responded to by United. The current world record fee in the women's game is  Â£400,000 paid by Barcelona to Manchester City last summer to secure the services of midfielder Keira Walsh. "I would be disappointed if we can't bring in a prolific goal scorer in addition to the signings we have made," Eidevall said earlier in January. "That should be a really important priority for us in this window with the numbers of games and the level of the games that we have."    If you know how agencies work, sometimes they have conversations before the legal time. These conversations have probably been ongoing for a while, but the reality for us is the players are very happy with what we   re doing at  Manchester United,    Skinner said earlier this month when quizzed about contract discussions with Russo and right back Ona Batlle - whose contract also expires in the summer.
