Crystal Palace are understood to have parted with at least  £18m to sign 21-year-old centre-back Marc Guehi from Chelsea. Guehi was one of the standout defenders in the Championship last season with Swansea City, and many Chelsea fans had hoped to see him given a shot in the Blues' first team this year. But a reluctance to go out on another loan saw him shipped out to Crystal Palace permanently.

However, that has now changed as both the Daily Mail and Adam Newson state Palace have agreed to pay  £18m to land Guehi - money which will go towards the pursuit of Borussia Dortmund striker Erling Haaland. "It was a big decision for me [to make a permanent move] because I   ve been at Chelsea for such a long time, since the age of seven," Guehi told Palace's official website. "Emotionally it was difficult after being at one place for such a long time and knowing that you wont be there. "Being at Chelsea really helped me in my development, getting better and helping myself excel. "I said goodbye to everyone, to the coaches that coached me since I was young and the people that helped me get to this stage. I   m extremely grateful for their help."
