Romelu Lukaku will discuss his future with Inter following Thomas Tuchel's dismissal at Chelsea. The Belgian forward fell out of favour under the German in his return season at Stamford Bridge and rejoined Inter on a season-long loan as a result. But with Tuchel now out of the picture and the club going in an entirely new direction following Graham Potter's arrival, Lukaku's future is once again unclear. Chelsea filled the void left by Lukaku's loan departure by signing Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang from Barcelona, with the Gabon international having worked with Tuchel at Borussia Dortmund in the past. But Tuchel is now gone and with Potter in, nobody is sure what that means for Lukaku, who only returned to Chelsea last summer and penned a five-year deal with the club. Speaking to Sky Sports Italia, Inter CEO Giuseppe Marotta admitted the club is unsure what happens next following the managerial change: "It   s fresh news. I don   t know what the effects of the change of coach will be. "We want to get the best performance out of Lukaku, and then at the end of the season we will sit down and talk about him with Chelsea. "I  don   t know if a change of coach means that his return is automatic, it   s difficult to predict today." Scott Saunders,  Graeme Bailey  and  Toby Cudworth  bring you a brand new episode of Talking Transfers.
