The agent and brother of Bologna striker Marko Arnautovic has confirmed he is trying to convince the Serie A side to accept a bid from Manchester United. United are looking to bolster in attack this summer amid uncertainty over the future of Cristiano Ronaldo and talks have been held with Bologna over a deal for 33-year-old Arnautovic, who worked with Ten Hag and assistant Steve McClaren earlier in his career with FC Twente. 90min understands that a    15m price tag has been put on Arnautovic's head by Bologna, but United are not yet willing to spend over    10m on the former Stoke and West Ham forward. Speaking to Kurier, Arnautovic's agent Danijel refused to name which side was interested in his brother but did admit that he is looking to get a deal over the line. "It's true that there's a bid from a well-known club," the agent said. "I'm in contact with Bologna to see if that can be realised."
