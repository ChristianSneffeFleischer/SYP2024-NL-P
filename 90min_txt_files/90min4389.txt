Manchester United defender Eric Bailly has warned that he is prepared to listen to offers from others clubs if he is not a regular starter next season, despite recently agreeing a new long-term contract at Old Trafford until at least 2024. United have long been on the hunt for a new centre-back to partner with Harry Maguire next season and beyond, putting the future of both Bailly and Victor Lindelof in doubt. However, the Ivory Coast international opted to sign a new deal in April after receiving assurances from the club, although he has now stressed that he won   t be satisfied if he is predominantly left on the bench and will look to leave if that happens.    I spoke to [Ole Gunnar Solskjaer] and he told me he wanted me to stay,    Bailly told The Times.    The most important thing was not the renewal but the conversation we had: we sat down, we talked and he told me what he wanted from me and that he wanted me to continue.    United have been heavily linked with a centre-back this summer. Raphael Varane, Pau Torres and Jules Kounde are the top names on the radar, but the arrival of any one of them could seriously hamper Bailly   s playing chances. He welcomes competition for places but is adamant that he wants to be playing.    Competition is always good to improve. I just say that I want to stay in case I get the chance to play. I don   t want to be a starter one game and a substitute for another five. If that happens, I will have to look for another solution,    Bailly explained.    The new contract is fine but, if I don   t play, I will be open to listen to other proposals.    Injuries have largely been responsible for Bailly playing just 105 times for United in five seasons since his  Â£30m arrival from Villarreal in the summer of 2016. But he is fit and in contention to feature against his former club in the Europa League final this week.
