Julian Nagelsmann has spoken on Timo Werner's imminent transfer from RB Leipzig to Chelsea, admitting he doesn't expect him to be at the club next season. It had looked for all the world as if Liverpool were going to be the club to snap the forward up in time for the 2020/21 season, with contact between Werner and Jurgen Klopp - as well as some public flitting - making a deal seem inevitable.  +3! ?

Liverpool's interest cooled as they baulked at paying the full buyout clause for the RB Leipzig striker, and unwilling to remain in Germany for another season, Werner agreed to move to Stamford Bridge.  While the    60m deal isn't actually comunicado oficial just yet, it seems as good as, something Nagelsmann has now admitted. "I do not expect Timo to be here next season," he told DAZN (via the Mirror) following his side's 2-0 win over Hoffenheim. While only three rounds of fixtures remain in the Bundesliga this season, Chelsea may be forced to wait much longer for the striker to join their ranks, since RB Leipzig remain in this season's Champions League. They've advanced to the quarter-final stage, but with the competition potentially not restarting again until August, Blues fans will be anxiously waiting to see their proposed new signing in the Premier League.
