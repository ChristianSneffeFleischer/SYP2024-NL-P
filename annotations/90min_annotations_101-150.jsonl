Alvarez has emerged as one of West Ham's top targets this summer, and is the choice of recently appointed technical director Tim Steidten. Steidten and manager David Moyes have been struggling to agree on targets throughout the summer. That has now seen West Ham switch focus to Alvarez after failing to seal deals for Southampton's James Ward-Prowse and Manchester United's Scott McTominay. West Ham, despite the record sale of Declan Rice, have yet to make a breakthrough in the transfer market and that plight was highlighted at the weekend as they were hammered 4-0 by Bayer Leverkusen - ironically Steidten's former club. He has now pushed ahead with a move for Alvarez in an attempt to get something done before the start of the Premier League season next weekend. feed Now, West Ham have made an initial offer  £25.9m for Alvarez. Although that isn't considered enough by Ajax, who are seeking just over  £30m, talks have continued and are at an advanced stage.

{"id":54,"text":"Manchester United have rejected  £30m offers from West Ham for Harry Maguire and Scott McTominay, sources have confirmed to 90min. West Ham saw an opening offer for former captain Maguire worth  £20m rebuffed last month before a more recent second proposal of  £30m was also dismissed by United. The Hammers also firmed up their interest in another United star in the shape of Scottish midfielder McTominay but, like with Maguire, the Red Devils were not willing to do business at the  £30m mark. 90min understands the actual offers were not too far away from United's valuation, but the overall deals including the wages West Ham could afford or were willing to provide were not sufficient enough to tempt the Old Trafford giants into selling either player. United, who themselves have spent more than  £100m this summer on Andre Onana, Mason Mount and Rasmus Hojlund, are anxious to move players on to finance other deals and Erik ten Hag has sanctioned the departures of both Maguire and McTominay.  However, neither player is desperate to move. feed Maguire remains unconvinced that his future is best served away from the club despite having the captaincy stripped, while McTominay also believes he could yet play his way into Ten Hag's plans given fellow midfielders Donny van de Beek and Fred are expected to move this summer.

{"id":56,"text":"As the coronavirus pandemic forced the world to pause, Alejo Veliz seriously considered pressing stop on his dreams of becoming a professional footballer. The 16-year-old had just begun pre-season with Central Rosario's youth team when COVID-19 hit. \"I couldn't go back and I started to think about studying something because it took too long,\" Veliz remembered. \"Thank God I stayed.\" Veliz made his debut for the senior side 18 months after the pandemic's outbreak and has been a fixture of the first team since 2022. This summer, the teenager has attracted increasing interest from the Premier League's Tottenham Hotspur. Aside from an iron will, here's why Spurs are leading the race for a player who almost gave up the game entirely three years ago.    ¥          Alejo V  liz, 1 a 0 y explota el Gigante pic.twitter.com\/mIBkaAWChy Veliz made his debut for Central in July 2021. Within 12 months, he had entered club folklore. Half-time was rapidly approaching in the fiercely contested Rosarian derby against Newell's Old Boys when Jhonatan Candia swung a free kick into the box. Veliz, who stands at 6'1, out-jumped his marker to loop Central into a lead. The only goal of the game sparked an ear-splitting roar in the Gigante de Arroyito. Veliz has many years of football ahead of him but will have to go some way to top a decisive contribution against your first club's biggest rivals. The winner against Newell's was only the third goal of Veliz's senior career but it would prove to be a prescient participation. Six of Veliz's 19 goals for Central exploded off his forehead and all three of his strikes during this year's under-20 World Cup were headers. Harry Kane broke the Premier League record for headed goals in a single season last term, notching ten. Tottenham's talisman took advantage of the team's myriad of set-piece ploys sketched up by the specialist coach Gianni Vio. The Italian may have parted ways with the club this summer but new manager Ange Postecoglou developed a range of routines during his time at Celtic. While Veliz would offer another aerial target other than Kane it would be an almighty task for the youngster to replace the England captain entirely if a move to Bayern Munich does materialise. Veliz may be one of the Argentine top flight's most exciting young strikers but he is best described as promising rather than prolific and still has plenty of rough edges to smooth - notably, his ability (or willingness) to create for others. If the teenager does move to Tottenham, it will surely be in an understudy role to the first choice option - whether that be Kane or the misfiring Richarlison. What Veliz does bring in abundance is grit. During Carlos Tevez's brief five months as Central coach, Veliz said that he \"took every piece of advice he gave me\". That tenacity embodied by the former Manchester United and Manchester City striker is evident in Veliz on and off the pitch. In April of this year, the day after scoring in a 2-2 draw against Boca Juniors, Veliz was driving to training when he was T-boned by a truck which fled the scene. He started Central's next match the following week. Just four days after playing in Argentina's last-16 exit from this summer's under-20 World Cup, Veliz not only appeared for Central but scored in a 4-1 win over Instituto. Team Appearances Goals Assists Rosario Central 62 19 2 Argentina Under-20s 9 3 0 feed An impressive tally of 11 goals in 23 top-flight games for Central this year - the highest tally of any teenager in the division - has attracted interest from across Europe. The bulk of bids swamping Rosario Central's transfer department stemmed from Serie A. AC Milan, Roma, Salernitana and Torino all expressed interest in the 19-year-old, who set tongues wagging at a greater velocity with his forceful displays in this year's under-20 World Cup. Tottenham's Premier League rivals Nottingham Forest also flirted with Veliz but 90min understands that the striker is prioritising a move to north London after Spurs agreed to meet his  £13m release clause. However, when Veliz will line up for the Lilywhites remains to be seen. Spurs are expected to hand Veliz a long-term deal but may be prepared to loan the striker back to Central in the immediate future. The Rosario club are certainly trying to keep hold of their talented forward - who would join the likes of Angel Di Maria and his potential Tottenham teammate Giovani Lo Celso in big-money moves away from Central. Talk of a loan until January, if not longer, has been floated. Just three short years ago, Veliz didn't look like making a professional appearance for any club, let alone one in the world's biggest league.","label":[[55,66,"PER"],[202,219,"ORG"],[345,350,"PER"],[385,390,"PER"],[513,517,"DAT"],[588,604,"ORG"],[605,622,"ORG"],[660,665,"ORG"],[836,841,"PER"],[861,868,"ORG"],[872,881,"DAT"],[1014,1031,"ORG"],[1037,1052,"PER"],[1085,1090,"PER"],[1141,1148,"ORG"],[1225,1244,"LOC"],[1246,1251,"PER"],[1413,1421,"ORG"],[1449,1456,"PER"],[1530,1537,"PER"],[1551,1558,"ORG"],[1633,1651,"ORG"],[1666,1676,"PER"],[1687,1701,"ORG"],[1770,1781,"ORG"],[1882,1892,"PER"],[1969,1985,"PER"],[2035,2041,"ORG"],[2049,2054,"PER"],[2100,2104,"PER"],[2167,2174,"ORG"],[2205,2218,"ORG"],[2237,2242,"PER"],[2509,2518,"ORG"],[2605,2609,"PER"],[2627,2638,"PER"],[2645,2650,"PER"],[2691,2705,"PER"],[2727,2734,"ORG"],[2742,2747,"PER"],[2839,2856,"ORG"],[2861,2876,"ORG"],[2899,2904,"PER"],[2930,2935,"DAT"],[2994,3006,"ORG"],[3008,3013,"PER"],[3102,3111,"ORG"],[3175,3186,"ORG"],[3219,3237,"ORG"],[3239,3244,"PER"],[3267,3274,"ORG"],[3304,3313,"ORG"],[3346,3361,"ORG"],[3370,3389,"ORG"],[3460,3467,"ORG"],[3567,3573,"LOC"],[3601,3618,"ORG"],[3652,3659,"ORG"],[3661,3669,"ORG"],[3671,3675,"ORG"],[3677,3688,"ORG"],[3693,3699,"ORG"],[3831,3849,"ORG"],[3851,3862,"ORG"],[3863,3877,"ORG"],[3885,3902,"ORG"],[3921,3926,"PER"],[3931,3936,"ORG"],[3992,4004,"LOC"],[4011,4016,"ORG"],[4037,4041,"MON"],[4072,4077,"PER"],[4099,4109,"ORG"],[4130,4135,"ORG"],[4157,4162,"PER"],[4228,4235,"ORG"],[4265,4272,"LOC"],[4368,4382,"PER"],[4401,4410,"ORG"],[4420,4436,"PER"],[4466,4473,"ORG"],[4496,4503,"DAT"],[4566,4571,"PER"]],"Comments":[]}

Spurs are looking to trim down their squad for new head coach Ange Postecoglou and ahead of a season in which they will not be competing in European football for the first time since 2009\/10. 90min reported last month that Davinson Sanchez had been granted permission to discuss a move away, with Strasbourg and Spartak Moscow interested in his services.

Ndombele was set to feature on Spurs' pre-season tour of Australia and Asia, but sustained an injury prior to their first friendly and has only just returned to training. feed Lazio are on the verge of signing free agent Daichi Kamada after AC Milan backed out of a deal last month. The Rossoneri had been expected to sign the Japan midfielder from Eintracht Frankfurt but pulled the plug following a shake-up among their transfer decision-makers. Tottenham and West Ham held talks with Kamada's representatives about a move but both ultimately stopped short of offering him a contract, and he will now put pen to paper on a contract with Lazio. A superb summer for Bournemouth is set to continue with the signing of Fiorentina midfielder Gaetano Castrovilli for a fee that could reach  £13.7m. The Cherries have ousted competition from Serie A giants Inter and Lazio for his signature, while Napoli had also made enquiries earlier this window. Castrovilli will arrive in England to undergo a medical on Friday and seal his move to the Vitality Stadium. While Fiorentina will lose Castrovilli, they will add Yerry Mina to their squad following his release from Everton. The Colombia international has completed his medical and will serve as a replacement for Igor, who recently signed for Brighton & Hove Albion. Fulham had held talks with Mina regarding a move but he is heading to Italy instead.","label":[[0,17,"ORG"],[36,47,"ORG"],[125,130,"ORG"],[132,137,"ORG"],[194,210,"PER"],[315,322,"DAT"],[324,329,"ORG"],[355,371,"PER"],[429,439,"ORG"],[444,458,"ORG"],[588,599,"ORG"],[670,683,"PER"],[685,692,"PER"],[720,734,"ORG"],[745,751,"ORG"],[753,770,"ORG"],[775,781,"ORG"],[806,811,"ORG"],[813,824,"ORG"],[871,882,"ORG"],[903,918,"PER"],[971,977,"ORG"],[996,1003,"ORG"],[1053,1072,"ORG"],[1073,1077,"PER"],[1081,1092,"ORG"],[1094,1102,"PER"],[1125,1130,"ORG"],[1151,1160,"LOC"],[1165,1169,"LOC"],[1270,1275,"ORG"],[1315,1328,"PER"],[1335,1343,"ORG"],[1377,1390,"ORG"],[1421,1426,"ORG"],[1443,1462,"ORG"],[1542,1551,"ORG"],[1556,1564,"ORG"],[1581,1589,"PER"],[1733,1738,"ORG"],[1760,1771,"ORG"],[1811,1821,"ORG"],[1833,1852,"PER"],[1881,1887,"MON"],[1889,1901,"ORG"],[1931,1938,"ORG"],[1946,1951,"ORG"],[1956,1961,"ORG"],[1987,1993,"ORG"],[2039,2050,"PER"],[2066,2073,"LOC"],[2130,2146,"LOC"],[2154,2164,"ORG"],[2175,2186,"PER"],[2202,2212,"PER"],[2255,2262,"ORG"],[2268,2276,"ORG"],[2353,2357,"PER"],[2383,2405,"ORG"],[2407,2413,"ORG"],[2434,2438,"PER"],[2477,2482,"LOC"]],"Comments":[]}

L'Equipe being L'Efake, this came from somewhere, let's try to understand the intention,\" the senior Neymar told PL Brasil.

He is thinking he might break my record. \"He would have to be there a good few more years if he is going to break that record. He plays a bit more of a wide role now. I don't think he has scored as many goals but I think he made just as many assists this year. \"He has become more of a team player. A couple of years ago, he was maybe being a little selfish. But in the last two years, he has become more of a team player. And I think he is making just as many assists as he is scoring goals. \"Good luck to him. If he does it, he does it. I don't care as long as he is winning things. There is no point doing that if you are not winning trophies. He can have that as long as they win a trophy.\"","label":[[13,22,"ORG"],[31,44,"PER"],[112,124,"LOC"],[170,175,"PER"],[231,247,"ORG"],[264,274,"ORG"],[341,346,"MON"],[351,355,"MON"],[402,411,"ORG"],[433,440,"PER"],[498,505,"PER"],[563,572,"ORG"],[612,615,"ORG"],[681,696,"PER"],[706,713,"ORG"],[716,723,"PER"],[745,748,"ORG"],[776,779,"ORG"],[836,842,"DAT"],[844,851,"PER"],[873,876,"ORG"],[878,883,"ORG"],[941,957,"ORG"],[961,966,"PER"],[1008,1017,"ORG"],[1073,1077,"DAT"],[1176,1181,"PER"],[1189,1198,"ORG"],[1309,1318,"ORG"],[1430,1438,"PER"],[1458,1466,"PER"],[1469,1473,"PER"],[1479,1490,"ORG"],[1493,1495,"PER"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":67,"text":"The Premier League has firmly cemented itself as the financial powerhouse of both European and world football - at least until the Saudi Pro League started throwing ridiculous wages around. The spending power of the biggest clubs in England's top flight is almost unrivalled in Europe with even mid-to-lower table sides now on a par with many top teams in Italy, Germany and Spain. For that reason, the general trend of spending figures in Premier League transfer windows is only going up, even if it's not quite as simple as the final figure being higher year on year. Here are the six highest-spending Premier League transfer windows ever. That such a recent year is down in sixth place is due to the real effects of the Covid-19 pandemic that began to be felt by football clubs. Less so at Premier League level, of course, but it still existed.Major moves in this summer transfer window included Romelu Lukaku's return to Chelsea from Inter for  £103.5m, Jack Grealish's switch from Aston Villa to Manchester City for  £100m and Jadon Sancho's  £76.5m arrival at Manchester United from Borussia Dortmund. A big summer for a number of teams, Liverpool spent big to bring in Alisson for  £66.8m and Naby Keita for  £48m, as well as Fabinho for  £39m. Man City splashed out on Riyad Mahrez for  £60m from Leicester, while Chelsea paid  £71.6m for Kepa Arrizabalaga.Fred arrived at Man Utd for  £47m and there were also plenty of mid-level deals done by some of the smaller sides in the league, such as Richarlison's  £25m move to Everton. You may expect this transfer window to have been more depressed due to the Covid-19 pandemic but there was little knowledge at this stage about just how disrupted life was going to be over the next couple of years.For that reason, Premier League spending was around the sort of level that had become the norm in the few years prior. Chelsea spent  £222.5m in this window on players like Kai Havertz, Timo Werner and Ben Chilwell. Man City signed Ruben Dias for  £61m, while Liverpool forked out  £40m on Diogo Jota. This was a record-breaking year at the time and really made a lot of people sit up and realise just how much the Premier League was now able to spend.Mohamed Salah arrived at Liverpool, though only for a modest fee of  £34m, while Man Utd spent  £146m on Romelu Lukaku, Nemanja Matic and Victor Lindelof. Man City parted with  £211m on various players that included Ederson, Danilo, Kyle Walker and Bernardo Silva.","label":[[4,18,"ORG"],[131,147,"ORG"],[233,242,"LOC"],[278,284,"LOC"],[356,361,"LOC"],[363,370,"LOC"],[375,380,"LOC"],[440,454,"ORG"],[604,618,"ORG"],[793,807,"ORG"],[899,914,"PER"],[925,932,"ORG"],[938,943,"ORG"],[949,956,"MON"],[958,973,"PER"],[986,997,"ORG"],[1001,1016,"ORG"],[1022,1027,"MON"],[1032,1046,"PER"],[1048,1054,"MON"],[1066,1083,"ORG"],[1089,1106,"ORG"],[1144,1153,"ORG"],[1176,1183,"PER"],[1189,1195,"MON"],[1200,1210,"PER"],[1216,1220,"MON"],[1233,1240,"PER"],[1246,1250,"MON"],[1252,1260,"ORG"],[1277,1289,"PER"],[1295,1299,"MON"],[1305,1314,"ORG"],[1322,1329,"ORG"],[1336,1342,"MON"],[1347,1364,"PER"],[1365,1369,"PER"],[1381,1388,"ORG"],[1394,1398,"MON"],[1502,1515,"PER"],[1517,1521,"MON"],[1530,1537,"ORG"],[1770,1784,"ORG"],[1872,1879,"ORG"],[1887,1894,"MON"],[1926,1937,"PER"],[1939,1950,"PER"],[1955,1967,"PER"],[1969,1977,"ORG"],[1985,1995,"PER"],[2001,2005,"MON"],[2013,2022,"ORG"],[2035,2039,"MON"],[2043,2053,"PER"],[2168,2182,"ORG"],[2205,2218,"PER"],[2230,2239,"ORG"],[2274,2278,"MON"],[2286,2293,"ORG"],[2301,2306,"MON"],[2310,2323,"PER"],[2325,2338,"PER"],[2343,2358,"PER"],[2360,2368,"ORG"],[2382,2387,"MON"],[2421,2428,"PER"],[2430,2436,"PER"],[2438,2449,"PER"],[2454,2468,"PER"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":68,"text":"Pep Guardiola got in on a joke that has dogged Josko Gvardiol for years. \"What a beautiful surname he has,\" Manchester City's manager grinned before confirming that the Croatian centre-back was undergoing a medical for the European and Premier League champions. Rather than an homage to the Catalan coach, Gvardiol's last name is actually derived from the Latin verb 'guardare', which fittingly translates as 'to guard'. Gvardiol may only be 21 years of age but he has emerged as one of the most highly rated defenders in the world - a lofty billing that is reflected by the hefty fee City belatedly agreed with RB Leipzig this summer. Here's how Gvardiol's transfer to Manchester City compares to the most expensive players to ever guard their own team's goal. Suits you, Josko!          pic.twitter.com\/ySy5CfUAQ9 Manchester City's Premier League rivals Chelsea were initially the front runners, failing with an approach for Gvardiol last summer before reigniting their interest in January. Real Madrid entered the race for the Golden Boy nominee, placing Gvardiol top of their centre-back targets in April as reported by 90min. However, Los Blancos have prioritised other areas of the pitch, notably midfield, while Chelsea opted to promote from within by handing the left-footed centre-back Levi Colwill a new six-year deal this summer. City's intent has not shifted even if their patience has been tested. The reigning Premier League champions are no strangers to walking away from a deal which does not match their valuation - as they have previously demonstrated with Harry Maguire, Marc Cucurella and even Declan Rice this summer. At one point in July, RB Leipzig sporting director Max Eberl threatened to step back from negotiations as the clubs remained \"very far apart\". Talks between both parties were gummed up by the proposed fee. RB Leipzig were intent on making Gvardiol the most expensive defender in history, eclipsing the  £80m which Manchester United spent on Maguire in 2019. Finally, after months of painstaking negotiations, City appear to have won the battle of wills. Three days before Gvardiol was officially unveiled, 90min revealed that Leipzig had settled for an initial fee of  £77.5m (   90m). The final sum for Gvardiol may have just been shy of Maguire's record, but where does he rank on the list of the game's most expensive defenders ever? feed Player Year signed Selling club Buying club Fee Harry Maguire 2019 Leicester Man Utd  £80m Josko Gvardiol 2023 RB Leipzig Man City  £77.5m Virgil van Dijk 2018 Southampton Liverpool  £75m Wesley Fofana 2022 Leicester Chelsea  £75m Lucas Hernandez 2019 Atletico Madrid Bayern Munich  £68m Matthijs de Ligt 2019 Ajax Juventus  £68m Ruben Dias 2020 Benfica Man City  £62m Achraf Hakimi 2021 Inter PSG  £59m Matthijs de Ligt 2022 Juventus Bayern Munich  £59m Marc Cucurella 2022 Brighton Chelsea  £55m Gvardiol slots into second place on the all-time list of costly defenders, sandwiched between the hulking figures of Maguire and Virgil van Dijk. Liverpool briefly made Van Dijk the most expensive centre-back ever in January 2018, coughing up  £75m to Southampton. During the previous summer, Van Dijk was accused of going on strike to force through a move by his last Southampton manager Mauricio Pellegrino. The Saints stuck to their guns and kept the unhappy defender on their books for another six months, driving up the price from an initial  £60m. Unsurprisingly, given the financial clout that the Premier League wields, the four most expensive defenders of all time have been signed by English clubs. Wesley Fofana moved to Chelsea in the summer of 2022 for the same fee as Van Dijk but has come nowhere near the performances produced by the 2019 UEFA Men's Player of the Year. Injury has routinely derailed Fofana's integration in west London. After sitting out 20 games during his debut campaign, the luckless Frenchman ruptured his cruciate ligament in July.  Matthijs de Ligt has been repeatedly linked with a move to the Premier League but is yet to permanently journey across the Channel. The towering Dutch centre-back is the only defender that has ever commanded two separate transfer fees in excess of  £50m. At just 21, Gvardiol has plenty of time to make another expensive move but he has to guard the goal for Guardiola's team first.","label":[[0,13,"PER"],[47,61,"PER"],[108,125,"ORG"],[236,250,"ORG"],[306,316,"PER"],[421,429,"PER"],[585,589,"ORG"],[612,622,"ORG"],[647,657,"PER"],[670,685,"ORG"],[773,778,"PER"],[816,833,"ORG"],[834,848,"ORG"],[856,863,"ORG"],[927,935,"PER"],[984,991,"DAT"],[993,1004,"ORG"],[1058,1066,"PER"],[1103,1108,"DAT"],[1124,1129,"ORG"],[1140,1151,"ORG"],[1219,1226,"ORG"],[1295,1307,"PER"],[1341,1347,"ORG"],[1424,1438,"ORG"],[1575,1588,"PER"],[1590,1604,"PER"],[1614,1625,"PER"],[1655,1659,"DAT"],[1661,1671,"ORG"],[1690,1699,"PER"],[1845,1855,"ORG"],[1878,1886,"PER"],[1942,1946,"MON"],[1953,1970,"ORG"],[1980,1987,"PER"],[1991,1995,"DAT"],[2048,2052,"ORG"],[2111,2119,"PER"],[2145,2150,"ORG"],[2165,2172,"ORG"],[2208,2214,"MON"],[2219,2222,"MON"],[2243,2251,"PER"],[2278,2287,"PER"],[2429,2442,"PER"],[2443,2447,"DAT"],[2448,2457,"ORG"],[2458,2465,"ORG"],[2467,2471,"MON"],[2472,2486,"PER"],[2487,2491,"DAT"],[2492,2502,"ORG"],[2503,2511,"ORG"],[2513,2519,"MON"],[2520,2535,"PER"],[2536,2540,"DAT"],[2541,2552,"ORG"],[2553,2562,"ORG"],[2564,2568,"MON"],[2569,2582,"PER"],[2583,2587,"DAT"],[2588,2597,"ORG"],[2598,2605,"ORG"],[2607,2611,"MON"],[2612,2627,"PER"],[2628,2632,"DAT"],[2633,2648,"ORG"],[2649,2662,"ORG"],[2664,2668,"MON"],[2669,2685,"PER"],[2686,2690,"DAT"],[2691,2695,"ORG"],[2696,2704,"ORG"],[2706,2710,"MON"],[2711,2721,"PER"],[2722,2726,"DAT"],[2727,2734,"ORG"],[2735,2743,"ORG"],[2745,2749,"MON"],[2750,2763,"PER"],[2764,2768,"DAT"],[2769,2774,"ORG"],[2775,2778,"ORG"],[2780,2784,"MON"],[2785,2801,"PER"],[2802,2806,"DAT"],[2807,2815,"ORG"],[2816,2829,"ORG"],[2831,2835,"MON"],[2836,2850,"PER"],[2851,2855,"DAT"],[2856,2864,"ORG"],[2865,2872,"ORG"],[2874,2878,"MON"],[2879,2887,"PER"],[2996,3003,"PER"],[3008,3023,"PER"],[3025,3034,"ORG"],[3048,3056,"PER"],[3096,3108,"DAT"],[3123,3127,"MON"],[3131,3142,"ORG"],[3172,3180,"PER"],[3248,3259,"ORG"],[3268,3287,"PER"],[3289,3299,"ORG"],[3427,3431,"MON"],[3484,3498,"ORG"],[3588,3601,"PER"],[3611,3618,"ORG"],[3636,3640,"DAT"],[3661,3669,"PER"],[3729,3733,"DAT"],[3734,3738,"ORG"],[3795,3803,"PER"],[3819,3830,"LOC"],[3943,3947,"DAT"],[3950,3966,"PER"],[4013,4027,"ORG"],[4069,4080,"LOC"],[4199,4203,"MON"],[4217,4225,"PER"],[4309,4320,"PER"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":69,"text":"Tottenham have turned down Bayern Munich   s club record transfer bid for Harry Kane, sources have confirmed to 90min. Bayern have been keen on landing Kane ever since Robert Lewandowski joined Barcelona last summer. They had already seen two offers rejected by Tottenham earlier this summer, but left a recent meeting between club representatives feeling optimistic about a deal being struck, before then entering their third bid worth    100m ( £86m). That figure was both a record for Bayern, far exceeding what they paid for Lucas Hernandez in 2019, as well as Tottenham, who sold Gareth Bale to Real Madrid for  £85m in 2013. Despite Bayern wanting a quick decision from Spurs, the Premier League side took their time in relaying a response. 90min understands that the answer has been given and it remains    no   . Bayern had made it clear that it was their best and final offer, but are currently considering whether or not to return with a fourth proposal for the England captain. feed Although optimistic at the start of August, Bayern have also started to weigh up other options once more. One alternative is Juventus striker Dusan Vlahovic, who has already asked for a transfer this summer following a sub-par season in Serie A. Bayern have been in touch with his representatives, although Juventus have also been in touch with Chelsea regarding a Romelu Lukaku plus cash swap. Another striker Bayern have long kept an eye on is Randal Kolo Muani at Eintracht Frankfurt, the    100m ( £86m) asking price, despite matching the offer for Kane, is not something they want to pay. Rather, Paris Saint-Germain have emerged as favourites for France international Kolo Muani. Personal terms have already been agreed following talks over the weekend, with the club expected to follow suit and agree a transfer fee between them. PSG are also willing to offer Hugo Ekitike, whose loan from Reims was made permanent in June, in part-exchange.","label":[[0,9,"ORG"],[27,40,"ORG"],[74,84,"PER"],[112,117,"ORG"],[119,125,"ORG"],[152,156,"PER"],[168,186,"PER"],[194,203,"ORG"],[262,271,"ORG"],[440,444,"MON"],[447,451,"MON"],[488,494,"ORG"],[529,544,"PER"],[548,552,"DAT"],[565,574,"ORG"],[585,596,"PER"],[600,611,"ORG"],[617,621,"MON"],[625,629,"DAT"],[639,645,"ORG"],[676,681,"ORG"],[687,701,"ORG"],[747,752,"ORG"],[821,827,"ORG"],[972,979,"ORG"],[1030,1036,"DAT"],[1038,1044,"ORG"],[1119,1127,"ORG"],[1136,1150,"PER"],[1231,1238,"ORG"],[1240,1246,"ORG"],[1301,1309,"ORG"],[1339,1346,"ORG"],[1359,1372,"PER"],[1405,1411,"ORG"],[1440,1457,"PER"],[1461,1480,"ORG"],[1489,1493,"MON"],[1496,1500,"MON"],[1547,1551,"PER"],[1596,1615,"ORG"],[1647,1653,"ORG"],[1668,1678,"PER"],[1831,1834,"ORG"],[1861,1873,"PER"],[1891,1896,"ORG"],[1919,1923,"DAT"]],"Comments":[]}

{"id":71,"text":"Barcelona midfielder Franck Kessie is closing in on a move to Saudi Pro League side Al Ahli, sources have confirmed to 90min. The Ivory Coast international only joined Barca from AC Milan on a free transfer last summer, and despite scoring a memorable last-minute winner against Real Madrid on their way to La Liga title glory, he was scarcely afforded extended chances at Camp Nou. 90min reported on Wednesday that Tottenham Hotspur had held talks with Barcelona over signing Kessie as well as teammate Clement Lenglet, who spent last season on loan in north London.

{"id":73,"text":"FROM TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR STADIUM - The second peak of Harry Kane's esteemed career coincided with Tottenham turning into a regressive and defensive team. From mid-2018 to the start of 2020, the striker became dogged by injuries, stripping him of a yard of pace and essentially pencilling him in for around ten games on the sidelines during any given season. By the time he effectively had back-to-back pre-seasons to reset his body during the pandemic, Spurs had fully committed to Jose Mourinho. Kane took on not only more of the scoring load alongside Son Heung-min, but also shouldered the creative burden. Through the Mourinho, Nuno Espirito Santo and Antonio Conte eras, Kane had to do everything in order to maintain Tottenham's attacking potency. Enter Ange Postecoglou, a head coach drafted in to restore Spurs' long-forgotten attacking principles. Kane scored Spurs' first four in a 5-1 pre-season thrashing of Shakhtar Donetsk on Sunday as they flexed their new identity back on home soil. For the first time since the days of Mauricio Pochettino, Tottenham are looking to play on the front foot, to dominate the ball, to suffocate teams with possession and chances. When Kane was substituted towards the end of the match, he was met with a standing ovation, his iconic chant sung loudly from all four corners of the ground. Just as it had after each of his four goals, just as it had before a ball had even been kicked this afternoon. Today's script may as well have been written by our new AI and ChatGPT overlords - once Kane was on the bench, a dark cloud emerged over the stadium. The heavens opened for five minutes before the sun began to reappear again. Heading into Sunday's encounter, Spurs were continuing to mull over a new bid from Bayern Munich worth  £86m. It could well be their last in a saga which is nearing an end. If Tottenham choose to cash in on Kane, they stop any risk of him walking away for free next summer when his contract expires. It's become clear that this is a risk they must take. Kane became the club's all-time leading scorer back in February when he grabbed the only goal in a remarkable 1-0 victory at home to eventual treble-winners Manchester City. At full-time, he was celebrated and heralded for his remarkable achievements. That's when it first sunk in - Tottenham Hotspur are Harry Kane, and Harry Kane is Tottenham Hotspur. manual If under-fire chairman Daniel Levy agrees to sell the club's greatest ever player, he would tank his already negative approval rating to ungodly levels. If Kane walks for free, Spurs miss out on a hefty fee for the balance sheet, but at least he can say he kept the striker for all six years of his contract, tried his darnedest to extend that deal. It's an incredibly rare feat for an academy graduate to become the face and soul of their boyhood club, especially in the super-club age. Tottenham should cherish this as long as they possibly can, kick the replacement striker can down the road for another year at least. If building a billion-pound stadium was meant to bridge the gap to the elite in the transfer market, it should also be able to absolve such a financial loss. There is, also, the Postecoglou factor. Kane scored 30 Premier League goals last season, his joint-best total despite sorry Spurs limping to an eighth place finish. In theory, he would be able to rival Erling Haaland for the Golden Boot in a team which creates bucketloads of chances rather than being drip-fed them. \"He's a fantastic striker, one of the world's best. I think the way the team plays will help him as well. He loves scoring goals and you saw today we created a load of chances and he was the beneficiary of that,\" Postecoglou said on Sunday. Tottenham still believe they could yet convince Kane to sign a new contract. This is more of a last chance than a last dance. The cruel world of modern football needs both to go through with it.","label":[[5,30,"LOC"],[52,64,"PER"],[96,105,"ORG"],[157,165,"DAT"],[182,186,"DAT"],[451,456,"ORG"],[480,493,"PER"],[495,499,"PER"],[552,565,"PER"],[620,628,"PER"],[630,649,"PER"],[654,667,"PER"],[674,678,"PER"],[721,732,"ORG"],[758,774,"PER"],[811,817,"ORG"],[855,859,"PER"],[867,873,"ORG"],[918,934,"ORG"],[1035,1054,"PER"],[1056,1065,"ORG"],[1180,1184,"PER"],[1532,1536,"PER"],[1703,1708,"ORG"],[1753,1766,"ORG"],[1774,1778,"MON"],[1846,1855,"ORG"],[1877,1881,"PER"],[2024,2028,"PER"],[2079,2087,"DAT"],[2181,2196,"ORG"],[2307,2324,"ORG"],[2329,2339,"PER"],[2345,2355,"PER"],[2359,2376,"ORG"],[2408,2419,"PER"],[2541,2545,"PER"],[2562,2567,"ORG"],[2873,2882,"ORG"],[3185,3196,"PER"],[3205,3209,"PER"],[3220,3234,"ORG"],[3289,3294,"ORG"],[3367,3381,"PER"],[3695,3706,"PER"],[3723,3732,"ORG"],[3771,3775,"PER"]],"Comments":[]}

{"id":79,"text":"Bayern Munich have drawn up a list of alternative options to Harry Kane in case their club record bid for the striker is rejected, 90min understands.  Sources confirmed to 90min last week that Bayern Munich had made a club record  £86m (   100m) bid to sign Tottenham talisman Kane this summer, having previously seen two offers rejected by Daniel Levy and co. in recent weeks.  As things stand, the Bundesliga holders are yet to receive a response from Tottenham regarding their most recent offer and have had no indication that it will be accepted.  Due to this uncertainty, Bayern officials have opted to draw up a list of alternative targets if a deal to sign Kane does not materliase.  feed 90min understands that one such alternative target is Dusan Vlahovic of Juventus. The forward asked to leave Juve in June - a request that was given its blessing by manager Massimiliano Allegri - following a disappointing 2022\/23 campaign in Turin in which he managed just 10 Serie A goals.  Bayern have now made contact with Vlahovic's representatives in order to check in on the player's current situation at Juventus. 90min recently reported that Vlahovic's current employers have made attempts to get rid of the forward this summer already. The club has proposed a swap deal with Chelsea that would see the Serbian move to Stamford Bridge in exchange for Romelu Lukaku plus cash.  While Chelsea have held talks with Vlahovic's camp, they are not keen on the aforementioned deal as they are not interested in paying a fee in additiona to parting with Lukaku to get the forward.  Another striker that Bayern have shortlisted is France international and Eintracht Frankfurt star Randal Kolo Muani. The emerging talent has been linked with Bayern earlier this year, however 90min understands that Frankfurt's asking price of  £86m is not a fee that the club would be willing to pay.  Paris Saint-Germain are currently favourite to sign Kolo Muani, with the player already agreeing personal terms after talks accelerated over the weekend.

{"id":80,"text":"Newcastle United have finalised the signing of right-back Tino Livramento from Southampton. A fee of around  £35m, plus a further  £5m in add-ons, has been paid by Newcastle, with around 40% of that sum heading to Livramento's boyhood club Chelsea as a result of a sell-on clause included in his 2021 switch to St Mary's Stadium.

And with how well the team did last season, the trajectory that we're on now, I'm just looking forward to being a part of that. \"And to be able to learn from Kieran Trippier is another big thing for me; hopefully he teaches me how to become a better player and a better full-back.\" feed Manager Eddie Howe added: \"Tino is a very talented young player with an exciting future ahead of him so we are delighted to sign him. \"At 20, he already has lots of attributes that I admire but he also has the potential and drive to really grow with this team.

{"id":83,"text":"A year is an awful long time in football, and that has certainly proved the case for Folarin Balogun.  This time last year, few would have known too much about the young Arsenal striker, but following an impressive loan spell with Stade Reims in Ligue 1, the 22-year-old is now one of the most exciting young forwards in Europe and a USMNT international. Scoring 22 goals in 39 games for Reims last season, he is now being targeted by a number of top clubs. However, 90min understands that Arsenal value Balogun at  £50m, which may put off some potential suitors. The Gunners have told Balogun he can find a new club with no obvious route into the first team as Gabriel Jesus, Eddie Nketiah and new signing Kai Havertz stand in his path. There will be many clubs knocking on his agent's door this summer, but where he will end up is still unclear. feed Having come within 90 minutes of Champions League glory last season, things promise to be more complicated for Inter this term. Andre Onana, Marcelo Brozovic, Edin Dzeko and Romelu Lukaku will not be at the club next season as Simone Inzaghi is responsible for something of a rebuild in key areas this summer. One position that needs strengthening in the window is up front. Having brought in Marcus Thuram on a free transfer to help Lautaro Martinez, Inzaghi is keen to reinforce his attacking unit further having lost two key centre-forward options. Balogun is one of the players Inter have been in contact with over a potential move to San Siro. More similar in profile to Martinez than Thuram, Balogun could offer depth and quality in attack. The forward has huge potential and could develop further in Serie A under Inzaghi's tutelage, but that  £50m fee would likely be unworkable for Inter. Considering West Ham are the only Premier League club yet to make a signing this window, David Moyes would probably be thankful to get anybody through the door at the London Stadium. The  £105m departure of Declan Rice means the Hammers have a huge budget to work with, but they have still been unable to get any deals done. Atalanta, who are a club linked with Balogun themselves, have agreed a deal for Irons forward Gianluca Scamacca after an unsuccessful stint with West Ham. Not only will this add another  £26m to available funds, it will free up a space up front that needs filling. Balogun could be the man to fill the gap, posing a completely different skillset to the departing Scamacca. Balogun's pace and nous for finding space in the penalty area could make him a prime target to add more goals to a sometimes blunt West Ham side. A return to Ligue 1 could be on the cards for Balogun, who would certainly need no time in readjusting to life in France. Lille finished fifth last season and qualified for the Europa Conference League, but would likely find it difficult to raise the required funds to prise Balogun away from north London. Paulo Fonseca's side have lost a couple of forward players in Timothy Weah and Jonathan Bamba this summer and need greater depth in attacking areas. Balogun, however, may be too far out of their price range. Jordan Ayew, Odsonne Edouard and Jean-Philippe Mateta are hardly the most awe-inspiring attacking trio in the Premier League. The three strikers have all struggled for consistency since arriving at Selhurst Park, and with Wilfried Zaha's exit, Palace need more goals next year. Michael Olise's potential departure would only exacerbate this issue, but Balogun could be the solution. The 22-year-old's ability to run in behind opposition defences makes him a completely different proposition to the Eagles' current centre-forward options. Similarly to Lille, however, Palace would be unlikely to splash  £50m on untested Premier League player, knowing a better could be found deal somewhere else in Europe. Ivan Toney scored 20 goals in 33 Premier League games last season but will not be available to Brentford until January 2024 following a ban for breaching betting rules. While Bryan Mbuemo, Kevin Schade, and Yoane Wissa are all capable of providing goals for the Bees next year, they won't be able to offer the same consistency as Toney. Balogun showcased his ability to score weekly for Reims last season, although doing it in the Premier League is admittedly a different proposition.  Balogun is also a different profile striker to Toney and is not quite as adept at holding the ball up and winning physical battles. Given Brentford just spent around  £20m on Schade following his move from Freiburg, they may not be in a position to spend big on Balogun.","label":[[85,100,"PER"],[170,177,"ORG"],[231,242,"ORG"],[246,253,"ORG"],[321,327,"LOC"],[334,339,"ORG"],[388,393,"ORG"],[467,472,"ORG"],[490,497,"ORG"],[504,511,"PER"],[516,520,"MON"],[564,575,"ORG"],[586,593,"PER"],[662,675,"PER"],[677,690,"PER"],[707,718,"PER"],[886,902,"ORG"],[964,969,"ORG"],[981,992,"PER"],[994,1010,"PER"],[1012,1022,"PER"],[1027,1040,"PER"],[1080,1094,"PER"],[1246,1259,"PER"],[1287,1303,"PER"],[1305,1312,"PER"],[1405,1412,"PER"],[1492,1500,"LOC"],[1529,1537,"PER"],[1543,1549,"PER"],[1551,1558,"PER"],[1660,1667,"ORG"],[1674,1683,"PER"],[1704,1708,"MON"],[1744,1749,"ORG"],[1763,1771,"ORG"],[1785,1799,"ORG"],[1840,1851,"PER"],[1918,1932,"LOC"],[1939,1944,"MON"],[1958,1969,"PER"],[1976,1987,"ORG"],[2076,2084,"ORG"],[2113,2120,"PER"],[2156,2161,"ORG"],[2170,2187,"PER"],[2221,2229,"ORG"],[2263,2267,"MON"],[2341,2348,"PER"],[2439,2447,"PER"],[2449,2458,"PER"],[2580,2588,"ORG"],[2607,2614,"ORG"],[2641,2648,"PER"],[2709,2715,"LOC"],[2717,2722,"ORG"],[2772,2796,"ORG"],[2870,2877,"PER"],[2888,2900,"LOC"],[2902,2917,"PER"],[2964,2976,"PER"],[2981,2995,"PER"],[3051,3058,"PER"],[3110,3121,"PER"],[3123,3138,"PER"],[3143,3163,"PER"],[3220,3234,"ORG"],[3308,3321,"LOC"],[3332,3347,"PER"],[3354,3360,"ORG"],[3388,3403,"PER"],[3462,3469,"PER"],[3604,3615,"ORG"],[3661,3666,"ORG"],[3677,3683,"ORG"],[3713,3717,"MON"],[3730,3744,"ORG"],[3808,3814,"LOC"],[3816,3826,"PER"],[3849,3863,"ORG"],[3911,3920,"ORG"],[3927,3939,"DAT"],[3991,4003,"PER"],[4005,4017,"PER"],[4023,4034,"PER"],[4074,4082,"ORG"],[4146,4151,"PER"],[4153,4160,"PER"],[4203,4208,"ORG"],[4247,4261,"ORG"],[4302,4309,"PER"],[4349,4354,"PER"],[4440,4449,"ORG"],[4469,4473,"MON"],[4477,4483,"PER"],[4508,4516,"ORG"],[4564,4571,"PER"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":84,"text":"Arsenal do not expect midfielder Jorginho to leave before the end of the summer transfer window despite rumoured interest from Fenerbahce. The Gunners recruited the Italy international back in January and he has since courted maintained interest from Serie A sides Lazio and Juventus. While a good offer would be enough for Arsenal to sell Jorginho - much like teammate Thomas Partey's current situation - 90min understands he isn't in talks with Turkish side Fenerbahce and an exit is not currently on the cards. Arsenal are preparing to let goalkeeper Matt Turner depart after agreeing an  £8m deal with Nottingham Forest for the USMNT international. Turner joined Arsenal in 2022 as back-up to Aaron Ramsdale and featured at the 2022 World Cup with the United States. Forest used Dean Henderson and Keylor Navas as goalies last season. Steve Cooper's side still like Manchester United's Henderson, but their preference for a loan deal due to his injury record differs to United favouring a permanent move. Roma defender Roger Ibanez was also a target for Forest, with talks over a    30m deal being held, but he has instead elected to join Saudi Pro League side Al Ahli. Napoli midfielder Piotr Zielinski is another player who will soon seal a move to the Middle East. Poland international Zielinski, who was a key figure in his side's historic Serie A title win last season, will soon confirm his move to Al Ahli, where Roberto Firmino, Allan Saint-Maximin and Edouard Mendy have all relocated this summer. Napoli are targeting Teun Koopmeiners and Gabri Veiga as potential replacements. Atalanta aren't looking to sell Koopmeiners for any less than    50m, while a    30m offer for Veiga was rejected by Celta Vigo. Paris Saint-Germain have agreed personal terms with Eintracht Frankfurt striker Randal Kolo Muani and a deal is close to completion. PSG see Kolo Muani as their ideal replacement for Kylian Mbappe and talks accelerated over the weekend. Youngster Hugo Ekitike was offered during negotiations, a player Frankfurt are appreciative of. The Ligue 1 champions are still tracking Joao Felix's situation, though favour a loan deal which they could pursue towards the end of the month. The Portugal forward also has an offer from Al Ahli but wants to stay in Europe. feed Burnley are ready to seize on Sheffield United's instability by pursuing a deal for Norwegian midfielder Sander Berge. The Blades have already lost Iliman Ndiaye this month and are ready to sell their other star midfielder to the Clarets. Berge only has a year left on his contract and has turned down fresh advances from United. Should a deal be agreed, Berge will still need to come through a medical, having seen a switch to Fulham in January fall through because of a knock. Burnley are also keen to wrap up a deal for Ajax striker Mohamed Daramy but face competition from Reims, who have entered the bidding late on in their search for a replacement for Folarin Balogun. Crystal Palace are in talks with Bayer Leverkusen over a loan move for centre-back Odilon Kossounou. Palace are looking to add to their options in central defence where Marc Guehi and Joachim Andersen have impressed and a deal with a    25m obligation to buy has been put forward. Leverkusen have also been in contact with Tottenham all summer over the future of fellow defender Edmond Tapsoba.","label":[[0,7,"ORG"],[33,41,"PER"],[127,137,"ORG"],[139,150,"ORG"],[165,170,"ORG"],[193,200,"DAT"],[251,258,"ORG"],[265,270,"ORG"],[275,283,"ORG"],[324,331,"ORG"],[340,348,"PER"],[370,385,"PER"],[406,411,"ORG"],[460,470,"ORG"],[514,521,"ORG"],[554,565,"PER"],[592,595,"MON"],[606,623,"ORG"],[632,637,"ORG"],[653,659,"PER"],[667,674,"ORG"],[678,682,"DAT"],[697,711,"PER"],[732,736,"DAT"],[737,746,"ORG"],[752,769,"ORG"],[771,777,"ORG"],[783,797,"PER"],[802,814,"PER"],[839,853,"PER"],[870,889,"ORG"],[890,899,"PER"],[974,980,"ORG"],[1009,1013,"ORG"],[1023,1035,"PER"],[1058,1064,"ORG"],[1087,1090,"MON"],[1143,1159,"ORG"],[1165,1172,"ORG"],[1174,1180,"ORG"],[1192,1207,"PER"],[1255,1270,"LOC"],[1272,1278,"ORG"],[1293,1302,"PER"],[1348,1355,"ORG"],[1409,1416,"ORG"],[1424,1439,"PER"],[1441,1460,"PER"],[1465,1478,"PER"],[1511,1517,"ORG"],[1532,1548,"PER"],[1553,1564,"PER"],[1592,1600,"ORG"],[1624,1635,"PER"],[1657,1660,"MON"],[1673,1676,"MON"],[1687,1692,"PER"],[1709,1719,"ORG"],[1721,1740,"ORG"],[1773,1792,"ORG"],[1801,1818,"PER"],[1854,1857,"ORG"],[1862,1872,"PER"],[1904,1917,"PER"],[1968,1980,"PER"],[2023,2032,"ORG"],[2058,2065,"ORG"],[2095,2107,"PER"],[2203,2211,"ORG"],[2243,2250,"ORG"],[2272,2278,"LOC"],[2285,2292,"ORG"],[2315,2333,"ORG"],[2390,2402,"PER"],[2404,2414,"ORG"],[2433,2446,"PER"],[2511,2522,"ORG"],[2524,2529,"PER"],[2607,2613,"ORG"],[2640,2645,"PER"],[2713,2719,"ORG"],[2723,2730,"DAT"],[2764,2771,"ORG"],[2808,2812,"ORG"],[2821,2835,"PER"],[2862,2867,"ORG"],[2944,2959,"PER"],[2961,2975,"ORG"],[2994,3010,"ORG"],[3044,3060,"PER"],[3062,3068,"ORG"],[3130,3140,"PER"],[3145,3161,"PER"],[3198,3201,"MON"],[3242,3252,"ORG"],[3284,3293,"ORG"],[3340,3354,"PER"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":85,"text":"Chelsea have contacted the representatives of USA midfielder Tyler Adams over a possible move to Stamford Bridge, 90min understands. Adams played for the USMNT at the 2022 World Cup and was relegated with Leeds in his first season in the Premier League having joined from RB Leipzig for  £15m. Adams suffered a hamstring injury in March and didn't add to his 24 league appearances thereafter. Leeds accepted they would likely lose Adams and international teammate Brenden Aaronson following their relegation to the Championship. Aaronson has since joined Union Berlin on loan, while Adams previously attracted interest from Newcastle. Sources have confirmed to 90min that Chelsea have now enquired over his availability. Adams has a release worth around  £25m and the Blues believe the midfielder would slot in well in west London. Leeds expect the 24-year-old to leave Elland Road by the end of the month, with Chelsea not the only Premier League side interested. Tottenham, Liverpool, Manchester United, Brighton and Brentford are all keeping tabs on the situation. feed Adams was in attendance for Leeds' opening Championship game of the season against Cardiff on Sunday as his side rescued a 2-2 draw thanks to goals from Liam Cooper and Crysencio Summerville. Chelsea have signed exciting talent like Nicolas Jackson and Christopher Nkunku so far this window but are light in midfield after the departures of Mason Mount, N'Golo Kante and Ruben Loftus-Cheek.

{"id":87,"text":"West Ham United have agreed to sell Gianluca Scamacca to Atalanta in a deal worth    30m ( £26m), sources have confirmed to 90min. The 24-year-old was one of the Hammers' marquee signings last summer, alongside Lucas Paqueta, but it was quickly apparent that a change in playing style would be needed to get the best out of the Italian. Injury complaints didn't help Scamacca in trying to settle in London, and he was unable to command a regular starting spot despite costing David Moyes and West Ham in excess of  £30m when joining from Sassuolo. Scamacca scored eight goals in all competitions from 27 appearances, but crucially netted just three times in the Premier League for West Ham, who laboured to 20 defeats from their 38 league games but did end their 43-year trophy drought by winning the Conference League. 90min revealed in early June that Roma had shown an interest in taking Scamacca back to Serie A, with the player showing a desire to return to his homeland. Jose Mourinho's side were unable to fund a permanent deal, however, and were instead looking to conclude a loan with option or obligation to buy. Inter also made a bid for Scamacca but sources have confirmed to 90min it's Atalanta who have agreed a deal with West Ham. feed Last season's Europa League quarter-finalists will pay a guaranteed    25m ( £21.6m) for Scamacca, with a further    5m in achievable add-ons included into the deal, and are set to partner him up with AC Milan's Charles De Ketelaere, who is nearing a loan move with option to buy. 90min understands that Scamacca is already en route to complete a medical, ending his stay in east London after just a year of the five he committed to little over 12 months ago. Scamacca's exit is another blow to a West Ham side who are yet to make a senior signing this summer - they are the only Premier League club who haven't - amid disagreements between Moyes and new technical director Tim Steidten over how to replace Declan Rice, who joined Arsenal earlier this summer in a British-record  £105m deal. West Ham are also yet to appoint a new club captain, even though the new Premier League season gets underway in six days when newly-promoted Burnley take on Manchester City.","label":[[0,15,"ORG"],[36,53,"PER"],[57,65,"ORG"],[85,88,"MON"],[91,95,"MON"],[124,129,"ORG"],[158,170,"ORG"],[211,224,"PER"],[367,375,"PER"],[399,405,"LOC"],[476,487,"PER"],[492,500,"ORG"],[515,519,"MON"],[538,546,"ORG"],[548,556,"PER"],[662,676,"ORG"],[681,689,"ORG"],[801,818,"ORG"],[820,825,"ORG"],[844,848,"DAT"],[854,858,"ORG"],[891,899,"PER"],[908,915,"ORG"],[977,992,"PER"],[1123,1128,"ORG"],[1149,1157,"PER"],[1188,1193,"ORG"],[1199,1207,"ORG"],[1236,1244,"ORG"],[1265,1278,"ORG"],[1322,1325,"MON"],[1328,1334,"MON"],[1340,1348,"PER"],[1368,1370,"MON"],[1452,1462,"ORG"],[1463,1483,"PER"],[1532,1537,"ORG"],[1555,1563,"PER"],[1626,1637,"LOC"],[1711,1721,"PER"],[1748,1756,"ORG"],[1831,1845,"ORG"],[1892,1897,"PER"],[1925,1937,"PER"],[1958,1969,"PER"],[1982,1989,"ORG"],[2031,2036,"MON"],[2043,2051,"ORG"],[2116,2130,"ORG"],[2184,2191,"ORG"],[2200,2215,"ORG"]],"Comments":[]}

Chelsea will also decide on the futures of fellow young midfielders Andrey Santos and Carney Chukwuemeka, both of whom saw plenty of minutes in pre-season.","label":[[0,7,"ORG"],[61,71,"PER"],[76,90,"PER"],[92,97,"ORG"],[162,166,"PER"],[278,291,"PER"],[361,368,"ORG"],[427,440,"PER"],[463,470,"ORG"],[526,538,"PER"],[543,557,"PER"],[567,572,"ORG"],[617,621,"PER"],[641,655,"ORG"],[681,685,"PER"],[744,751,"ORG"],[774,778,"PER"],[864,879,"LOC"],[915,919,"PER"],[965,973,"ORG"],[974,987,"PER"],[998,1005,"ORG"],[1058,1062,"PER"],[1121,1128,"PER"],[1164,1171,"ORG"],[1238,1252,"ORG"],[1254,1261,"ORG"],[1304,1311,"PER"],[1373,1391,"ORG"],[1455,1460,"ORG"],[1466,1478,"PER"],[1502,1514,"ORG"],[1621,1640,"PER"],[1663,1673,"ORG"],[1800,1807,"ORG"],[1868,1881,"PER"],[1886,1904,"PER"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":95,"text":"Real Madrid stars Vinicius Junior and Eder Militao have added fuel to the fire surrounding Kylian Mbappe's future with a message to Madrid chief scout Juni Calafat. Mbappe has been made available for transfer this summer after declining to trigger the extension in his current Paris Saint-Germain contract, which now expires next summer. Real Madrid are long-term admirers of Mbappe and are planning to secure the Frenchman's signature either this summer or next year on a free transfer, while PSG have attempted to drum up interest from elsewhere to ensure they do not lost their talisman for nothing.  A world record bid from Al Hilal was accepted by the club but rejected by Mbappe himself, while Premier League sides like Chelsea have been contacted but are not confident of convincing the Frenchman, whose focus remains on Madrid. While an official offer from Madrid is yet to arrive, a number of players have taken the opportunity to fuel the speculation, with winger Rodrygo posting a picture alongside Mbappe last week with no caption. feed Now, Vinicius and Militao have continued to tease fans after a video emerged (via GOAL) with the duo telling chief scout Calafat: \"We hope [Mbappe] will come. Juni has to sign him.\" Calafat responded to the duo, joking: \"You are spending all our money in Ibiza. We   ll no longer have enough for Mbappe.\" PSG have returned to France to finalise their preparations for the upcoming Ligue 1 season and face a decision over what to do with Mbappe, who has been training with a group of transfer-listed players and has not yet worked under new manager Luis Enrique. The Parisians will get their season underway on Saturday when they welcome Lorient to Parc des Princes.","label":[[0,11,"ORG"],[18,33,"PER"],[38,50,"PER"],[91,106,"PER"],[132,138,"ORG"],[151,163,"PER"],[165,171,"PER"],[277,296,"ORG"],[338,349,"ORG"],[376,382,"PER"],[494,497,"ORG"],[628,636,"ORG"],[678,684,"PER"],[700,714,"ORG"],[726,733,"ORG"],[828,834,"ORG"],[865,871,"ORG"],[974,981,"PER"],[1010,1016,"PER"],[1054,1062,"PER"],[1067,1074,"PER"],[1131,1135,"ORG"],[1170,1177,"PER"],[1189,1195,"PER"],[1208,1212,"PER"],[1231,1238,"PER"],[1304,1309,"LOC"],[1345,1351,"PER"],[1354,1357,"ORG"],[1375,1381,"LOC"],[1430,1437,"ORG"],[1486,1492,"PER"],[1597,1609,"PER"],[1686,1693,"ORG"],[1697,1713,"LOC"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":96,"text":"Edson Alvarez is undergoing a medical at West Ham United ahead of joining from Ajax on a five-year contract. Sources have confirmed to 90min that an agreement has been reached in principle over a deal worth  £34m, with the Mexico international one of West Ham's top targets to replace Declan Rice. The Hammers have endured a frustrating transfer window so far, amid clashes between manager David Moyes and technical director Tim Steidten over targets, and have seen bids for Joao Palhinha, Conor Gallagher and James Ward-Prowse turned down. Manchester United's Scott McTominay has also been on the radar, but Alvarez, alongside Monaco's Youssouf Fofana, is a player that Steidten has been pushing for West Ham to sign. 90min revealed on Sunday that talks were ongoing with Dutch giants Ajax over a fee for Alvarez, who has long indicated his desire to move to the Premier League, and sources have now confirmed that an agreement has been reached over a deal that could eventually be worth  £34m. Alvarez was close to joining Borussia Dortmund earlier this summer but a deal to move to the Bundesliga runners-up fell through at the 11th hour. feed 26-year-old Alvarez has also been on the radar of Manchester United and Chelsea over the past 12 months, though both clubs have moved on to secure other targets and their interest has subsequently cooled. West Ham hope that Alvarez, who is expected to sign a long-term contract barring any last minute complications, will be the first of up to half a dozen new signings at London Stadium. The club are gearing up to compete in the Europa League after winning last season's Conference League, but haven't added to their squad yet and have seen captain Rice leave for Arsenal in a British-record  £105m deal. Another central midfield arrival is high up on West Ham's transfer agenda, while they would also like to sign a new central defender, left back and centre forward as a minimum - the need for the latter highlighted further by the club agreeing to send Gianluca Scamacca back to Italy just 12 months into a five-year deal. Atalanta confirmed his arrival from West Ham in a deal worth  £26m on Monday, allowing the Premier League side to recoup the majority of the money they paid Sassuolo in July 2022.","label":[[0,13,"PER"],[41,56,"ORG"],[79,83,"ORG"],[135,140,"ORG"],[208,212,"MON"],[223,229,"ORG"],[251,261,"ORG"],[285,296,"PER"],[298,309,"ORG"],[390,401,"PER"],[425,437,"PER"],[475,488,"PER"],[490,505,"PER"],[510,527,"PER"],[541,560,"ORG"],[561,576,"PER"],[609,616,"PER"],[628,636,"ORG"],[637,652,"PER"],[671,679,"PER"],[701,709,"ORG"],[719,724,"ORG"],[786,790,"ORG"],[806,813,"PER"],[864,878,"ORG"],[990,994,"MON"],[996,1003,"PER"],[1025,1042,"ORG"],[1089,1099,"ORG"],[1127,1140,"TIM"],[1159,1166,"PER"],[1197,1214,"ORG"],[1219,1226,"ORG"],[1352,1360,"ORG"],[1371,1378,"PER"],[1520,1534,"LOC"],[1578,1591,"ORG"],[1620,1637,"ORG"],[1698,1702,"PER"],[1713,1720,"ORG"],[1742,1747,"MON"],[1801,1811,"ORG"],[2005,2022,"PER"],[2031,2036,"LOC"],[2075,2083,"ORG"],[2111,2119,"ORG"],[2137,2141,"MON"],[2166,2180,"ORG"],[2232,2240,"PER"],[2244,2253,"DAT"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":97,"text":"Arsenal have submitted an opening offer for Brentford goalkeeper David Raya, 90min understands. Brentford have made it clear all summer that they are prepared to sell Raya, who is in the final year of his contract, for  £40m - an asking price which scared off Tottenham before they signed Guglielmo Vicario instead. After expressing an interest in Raya earlier this week, Arsenal have now opened the bidding with an offer which 90min understands is closer to half of Brentford's asking price. An initial  £20m has been proposed, with Arsenal also prepared to pay up to  £5m in potential add-ons. Brentford are expected to reject the offer as they stand firm on their asking price. Manager Thomas Frank recently insisted  £40m is cheap for Raya, pointing to Arsenal's decision to sign another player in the final year of their contract, Declan Rice, for  £105m. feed Arsenal are not alone in their pursuit of Raya, with German giants Bayern Munich also keen on the Spaniard as they seek to replace Yann Sommer, who is expected to join Inter. Sommer has acted as cover for the injured Manuel Neuer after the German broke his leg following the conclusion of the World Cup but is expected to leave this summer and Bayern are keen to move for Raya, although Brentford's asking price continues to prove problematic. Raya himself confessed earlier this summer that he feared Brentford's  £40m demand would price him out of a transfer, although the 27-year-old vowed to respect his club's decision and remain focused on the job if he is not granted an exit. As for Brentford, they have already signed a replacement for Raya, striking a deal to recruit Dutch international Mark Flekken from Freiburg last month.","label":[[0,7,"ORG"],[44,53,"ORG"],[65,75,"PER"],[96,105,"ORG"],[167,171,"PER"],[220,224,"MON"],[260,269,"ORG"],[289,306,"PER"],[348,352,"PER"],[372,379,"ORG"],[428,433,"ORG"],[467,478,"ORG"],[505,509,"MON"],[534,541,"ORG"],[570,573,"MON"],[596,605,"ORG"],[689,701,"PER"],[721,725,"MON"],[739,743,"PER"],[757,766,"ORG"],[836,847,"PER"],[854,859,"MON"],[866,873,"ORG"],[908,912,"PER"],[933,946,"ORG"],[997,1008,"PER"],[1034,1039,"ORG"],[1041,1047,"PER"],[1083,1095,"PER"],[1159,1168,"ORG"],[1210,1216,"ORG"],[1238,1242,"PER"],[1253,1264,"ORG"],[1310,1314,"PER"],[1368,1379,"ORG"],[1381,1385,"MON"],[1557,1566,"ORG"],[1611,1615,"PER"],[1664,1676,"PER"],[1682,1690,"ORG"]],"Comments":[]}

However, with Barca's interest reigniting, 90min understands Silva has again made it clear to City and Guardiola that he would like to leave the club - the Portuguese international said the same 12 months ago but was asked to stay for another season, at which point the Premier League champions would look at letting him leave as long as their valuation of around  £80m was met. But the departures of Riyad Mahrez and Ilkay Gundogan have seen City change their stance on Silva and now insist they can't afford to let him leave, even if a club agree to meet the valuation - something Ligue 1 giants Paris Saint-Germain have already indicated they would be willing to do. Now Barca, who are set to pocket nearly  £60m from the sales of Ousmane Dembele and Franck Kessie, are trying to package together a deal that will convince City to let Silva go, having previously thought a deal was unattainable because of their precarious finances. feed Barca are also locked in talks with City over the future of Joao Cancelo, who has agreed personal terms, and they hope they can come to agreement that will take both Portugal internationals to Catalonia this summer - but sources have told 90min that as it stands City will not sell.

{"id":100,"text":"West Ham United have made a second bid for former Manchester United captain Harry Maguire, sources have confirmed to 90min. The Hammers are looking to strengthen their squad with as many as six signings before the transfer window closes, but have only signed Cliftonville youngster Sean Moore to date. The club is yet to splash any of the immediate cash received from Declan Rice's  £105m British-record move to Arsenal. A deal for Ajax midfielder Edson Alvarez is nearing completion after a fee was agreed and West Ham have now returned with another offer for Maguire after an initial approach was knocked back at the end of July. Sources have confirmed to 90min that West Ham's new bid is worth  £30m, though any deal, should United decide the fee is enough, is likely to hinge on the 13-time Premier League winners continuing to contribute towards Maguire's hefty wages. United manager Erik ten Hag has established Raphael Varane and Lisandro Martinez as his first-choice centre-back duo at Old Trafford, with Victor Lindelof and Luke Shaw, naturally a left-back, also ahead of Maguire in the pecking order for places. feed Maguire has also been stripped of the club captaincy this summer, in favour of appointing Bruno Fernandes, and United are willing to sanction his exit if they receive an offer that they believe reflects his market value - they paid Leicester  £80m for his services in 2019.
