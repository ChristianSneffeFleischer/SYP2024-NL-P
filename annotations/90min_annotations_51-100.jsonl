The Blues have also informed Leeds of their intention to pay Adams' release clause in full, and he is expected to undergo a medical within the next 24 hours.

{"id":53,"text":"Manchester United goalkeeper Matej Kovar is on the verge of a permanent transfer away from the club as he undergoes a medical with Bayer Leverkusen, sources have confirmed to 90min. Now 23, Kovar has been with United since the age of 17. He joined from home-town club Solvacko in 2018 and has been loaned out to Swindon Town, Burton Albion and Sparta Prague during that time. It was his loan at Sparta last season that brought Kovar to wider attention. It was his very first year as a top flight starter and he helped the club win the Czech First League and return to the Champions League qualifying rounds. 90min reported in May that Kovar   s form on loan had caught the eye of his parent club. There were glowing reviews coming back from Prague and he was included in the thought process regarding the goalkeeping position long before Andre Onana was eventually signed. At a time when David de Gea was widely expected to sign a new contract at Old Trafford, United staff considered the possibility that Kovar could emerge as the Spaniard   s chief back-up and limit the need to spend big on a new goalkeeper. feed However, De Gea   s contract offer was later withdrawn and revised, ultimately leading to him leaving the club as a free agent. It accelerated the need for a readymade number one and so the club spent handsomely to sign Onana from Inter, reuniting the Cameroonian with Erik ten Hag. Kovar was briefly involved in United   s pre-season programme, playing 135 minutes of the opening two summer friendlies against Leeds and Lyon. But his immediate future now lies elsewhere. 90min understands that a  £7.8m (   9m) transfer fee has been agreed with Bayer Leverkusen and that a medical to complete the transfer is already being undertaken. Ties with Kovar have not been fully cut though, as United have retained a buy-back clause that could see him return to Manchester. Leverkusen finished sixth in the Bundesliga last season following a remarkable turnaround once Xabi Alonso was appointed head coach, having been flirting with relegation initially. It means that Kovar could have the chance to play Europa League football in 2023\/24. He will compete with veteran Finland international and current Leverkusen captain Lukas Hradecky.","label":[[0,17,"ORG"],[29,40,"PER"],[131,147,"ORG"],[175,180,"ORG"],[190,195,"PER"],[210,216,"ORG"],[263,276,"ORG"],[280,284,"DAT"],[312,324,"ORG"],[326,339,"ORG"],[344,358,"ORG"],[395,401,"ORG"],[427,432,"PER"],[535,553,"ORG"],[572,588,"ORG"],[608,613,"ORG"],[626,629,"DAT"],[635,640,"PER"],[741,747,"LOC"],[838,849,"PER"],[888,900,"PER"],[947,959,"LOC"],[961,967,"ORG"],[1006,1011,"PER"],[1126,1132,"PER"],[1337,1342,"PER"],[1348,1353,"ORG"],[1386,1398,"PER"],[1400,1405,"PER"],[1430,1436,"ORG"],[1528,1533,"ORG"],[1538,1542,"ORG"],[1589,1594,"ORG"],[1615,1620,"MON"],[1625,1627,"MON"],[1663,1679,"ORG"],[1763,1768,"PER"],[1804,1810,"PER"],[1872,1883,"LOC"],[1884,1894,"ORG"],[1917,1927,"ORG"],[1979,1990,"PER"],[2079,2084,"PER"],[2115,2128,"ORG"],[2141,2148,"DAT"],[2179,2186,"LOC"],[2213,2223,"ORG"],[2232,2246,"PER"]],"Comments":[]}

The proposed structure of the deal will financially benefit Arsenal, who have already splashed out more than  £200m in transfer fees this summer on Kai Havertz, Jurrien Timber and Declan Rice. Hailing from Barcelona, Raya has spent his entire senior career in English football, having moved from Catalan club Cornella to Blackburn   s academy at the age of 16 almost a decade ago.","label":[[0,7,"ORG"],[28,37,"ORG"],[49,59,"PER"],[132,136,"DAT"],[138,143,"ORG"],[157,161,"PER"],[239,248,"ORG"],[283,287,"MON"],[315,324,"ORG"],[329,342,"ORG"],[368,375,"ORG"],[400,404,"MON"],[473,478,"ORG"],[528,532,"PER"],[566,575,"ORG"],[626,630,"DAT"],[742,749,"ORG"],[782,789,"DAT"],[844,855,"ORG"],[912,916,"MON"],[991,998,"ORG"],[1023,1027,"PER"],[1125,1134,"ORG"],[1323,1330,"ORG"],[1373,1378,"MON"],[1411,1422,"PER"],[1424,1438,"PER"],[1443,1454,"PER"],[1469,1478,"ORG"],[1480,1484,"PER"],[1567,1580,"ORG"],[1584,1593,"ORG"]],"Comments":[]}

{"id":66,"text":"Juventus' training match against Juventus Next Gen was interrupted on Wednesday by a pitch invasion which saw supporters protest a possible move for Chelsea striker Romelu Lukaku. The clubs have spoken this summer about a possible deal for Lukaku which would also see Dusan Vlahovic head to Stamford Bridge, but while Chelsea appreciate the Serbian striker, 90min understands they have a huge issue with Juve's demand for an extra  £35m as part of the deal. These negotiations came after Lukaku's proposed return to Inter collapsed when the Italian side learned of talks between Juventus and the Belgian, who had privately and publicly vowed never to play for any Serie A side other than Inter. As a result, Lukaku's proposed move to the Allianz Stadium has not gone down well among fans, many of whom were heard screaming \"No, we don't want Lukaku\" during Wednesday's friendly - chants which initially began in the stands during the first minute of the game. It's worth noting that this game between Juventus and Juventus Next Gen took the place of the annual Villar Perosa friendly, in which it is tradition for fans to invade the pitch. But while the event is usually full of positivity as fans get the chance to meet players, a large number of supporters chose to use the opportunity to oppose a move for Lukaku instead.

PSG have responded by trying to sell Mbappe this summer, in a desperate bid to avoid losing one of the world's best players on a free transfer, but he has made it clear on numerous occasions that he intends to leave next year as a free agent.

Chelsea have also been contracted by PSG in a bid to drum up further interest in Mbappe, as have a number of other heavyweight European clubs. Mbappe was left out of PSG's recent pre-season tour of Japan and has been banished from first-team duties as the dispute between player and club rages on - sources have told 90min that club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi has even warned Fayza Lamari, his mother and agent, that Mbappe will 'not put a PSG shirt on again.' manual Despite the hostile atmopshere, Mbappe's position on the matter remains unchanged. 90min understands that he intends to spend the next 12 months in Paris before moving on to his next venture, which many believe will be at Real Madrid, and he has informed PSG of his plan.

Even without a dismal pre-season with Arsenal, Balogun has long been expected to leave the club once again this summer but this time permanently - the player himself stated in June that he \"definitely\" would not go out on loan again. The USMNT international has also consistently rejected the opportunity to enter talks over a new contract at the Emirates Stadium due to the lack of guarantees of game time.  90min reported in July that this resistance to signing a new deal, and unwillingness to go out on loan, has led to Arsenal slapping a  £50m price tag on the striker. feed Crystal Palace, West Ham United, Brentford, Fulham and UEFA Champions League finalists Inter have all been in contact regarding the player's services, but sources have now confirmed to 90min that Monaco are the first to table an offer.

The Reds opened talks with Brighton on Thursday as they pivoted from Southampton's Romeo Lavia to Caicedo and now terms are agreed between the two clubs. Caicedo had been Chelsea's prime midfield target all summer, but they baulked at the idea of meeting Brighton's value - which has always been at least  £100m - while Liverpool's offer of  £111m was immediately accepted. Such a deal would represent a British record, eclipsing the  £106m Chelsea paid to land Enzo Fernandez in January. Chelsea made numerous offers for Caicedo, but their highest did not exceed  £80m and now they have missed out on the Ecuador star who is destined for Anfield, where he will help form an overhauled midfield containing Hungarian star Dominik Szoboszlai and former Seagulls teammate Alexis Mac Allister. feed Caicedo is now due to head to Merseyside to complete his medical and is expected to sign his contract before this weekend's Premier League opener, which just so happens to come against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Sunday. For Liverpool, the deal is an obvious club record, eclipsing the  £75m paid to sign centre-back Virgil van Dijk from Southampton in January 2018.

{"id":79,"text":"Manchester City believe they have convinced both Bernardo Silva and Kyle Walker to stay at the club and sign new contracts, sources have confirmed to 90min. Both players have been considering their futures this summer and had been looking to leave the treble-winners during the transfer window. However, after allowing Riyad Mahrez to join Ilkay Gundogan out the exit door, Man City boss Pep Guardiola and the club's hierarchy have been firm with their stance that Silva and Walker must not be sold as well. 90min revealed earlier this summer that Walker, like Mahrez, was left furious at missing out on the Champions League final and had been looking at his options to leave.

{"id":80,"text":"Manchester United are set to enter the transfer market to sign a new centre-back following the completion of Harry Maguire's  £30m move to West Ham, 90min understands. Maguire is in discussions over a move to east London after being made available for transfer this summer by Erik ten Hag, who has already stripped the 30-year-old of the United captaincy. Maguire had initially wanted to stay and fight for his place but is now likely to proceed with his Old Trafford departure after talks between the clubs progressed this week. The England international arrived in 2019 for  £80m, a world record transfer fee for a defender, but has suffered a difficult four years under successive managers Ten Hag, Ralf Rangnick and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. He has lost his place entirely in the team under the Dutchman, who has not deemed Maguire suitable to execute the style of football he'd like to implement in Manchester. It had been part of Ten Hag's long-term plan to phase out and replace Maguire, despite his public suggestions otherwise, and now his departure is nearing completion, United are exploring names to replace his position in the squad. They have been offered Benjamin Pavard, a French World Cup winner who has been looking to leave Bayern Munich for the duration of the summer. He would carry the added bonus of being able to cover at right-back should he swap southern Germany for north west England. Bayern are open to letting Pavard leave and he'd likely cost United in the region of what they'd receive for Maguire. feed Nice centre-back Jean-Clair Todibo is a younger alternative at a similar price under consideration, while Liverpool target Perr Schuurs, now of Torino but formerly of Ten Hag's Ajax, is also liked behind the scenes. Everton's Jarrad Branthwaite is another central defender United have been following. Edmond Tapsoba, a Tottenham target who plays for Bayer Leverkusen, represents a more expensive option if United choose to go down that route, though it remains to be seen at present how much they are prepared to outlay and how ambitious they'd like to be with their replacement. Benfica's Antonio Silva is understood to be loved by club scouts but potentially the most expensive of those named. The club are looking to raise funds through the sales of a number of squad players - not just that of Maguire - and are close to moving Fred out of Old Trafford, with several parties interested in the Brazilian. Donny van de Beek is also set to depart for Real Sociedad in the coming weeks, with United pushing for a permanent deal, while Scott McTominay is still of interest to West Ham, who are now threatened by interest from Manchester City in Lucas Paqueta.","label":[[0,17,"ORG"],[109,124,"PER"],[126,130,"MON"],[139,147,"ORG"],[149,154,"ORG"],[168,175,"PER"],[209,220,"LOC"],[276,288,"PER"],[356,363,"PER"],[455,467,"LOC"],[534,541,"ORG"],[567,571,"DAT"],[577,581,"MON"],[693,700,"PER"],[702,715,"PER"],[720,740,"PER"],[824,831,"PER"],[900,910,"ORG"],[932,941,"PER"],[982,989,"PER"],[1078,1084,"ORG"],[1166,1181,"PER"],[1192,1201,"ORG"],[1239,1252,"ORG"],[1368,1384,"LOC"],[1389,1407,"LOC"],[1409,1415,"ORG"],[1436,1442,"PER"],[1470,1476,"ORG"],[1518,1525,"PER"],[1532,1536,"ORG"],[1549,1566,"PER"],[1638,1647,"ORG"],[1655,1667,"PER"],[1676,1682,"LOC"],[1699,1708,"PER"],[1709,1713,"ORG"],[1748,1757,"ORG"],[1758,1776,"PER"],[1805,1811,"ORG"],[1833,1847,"PER"],[1851,1860,"ORG"],[1882,1898,"ORG"],[1938,1944,"ORG"],[2112,2121,"ORG"],[2122,2135,"PER"],[2330,2337,"PER"],[2364,2368,"PER"],[2376,2388,"LOC"],[2440,2457,"PER"],[2484,2497,"ORG"],[2524,2530,"ORG"],[2567,2582,"PER"],[2607,2615,"ORG"],[2657,2672,"ORG"],[2676,2689,"PER"]],"Comments":[]}

{"id":82,"text":"Jurgen Klopp is never shy in expressing his vehement distaste for numerous aspects of modern football's calendar. Whether it's Saturday lunchtime kick-offs or England's festive fixture list, the Liverpool manager is quick to voice his criticism. The latest scheduling conflict to irk Klopp has been the closing date of the Saudi Pro League's summer transfer window. \"I think pretty much the worst thing is that the transfer window in Saudi Arabia is three weeks longer open,\" Klopp argued ahead of the new Premier League season. \"That's not helpful. So there must be, UEFA, FIFA must find solutions for that.\" Klopp knows the power that the Pro League wields better than most after watching two of his starting midfielders Jordan Henderson and Fabinho move to the Middle East this summer. Here's exactly when the Saudi Pro League transfer window closes and how it compares to its European counterparts. Much like most European divisions and northern hemisphere leagues in general, the Saudi Pro League transfer window began on 1 July. Before the window had even officially opened, Saudi clubs had begun to reshape the transfer market with the earth-shattering arrival of Karim Benzema at top-flight champions Al Ittihad. While Cristiano Ronaldo's move to Al Nassr last December was ground-breaking, the acquisition of the reigning Ballon d'Or winner was a statement move. There is still plenty of time for many more. The Saudi Arabian sports ministry has put aside around $800m ( £628m) for transfers to the top flight this summer, per the New York Times. The newly expanded 18-team league has until 20 September to splurge this hulking mass of capital. According to the detailed report in the New York Times, Saudi clubs were each provided with numerous transfer recommendations at the start of the window alongside a set of ground rules to prevent inter-league competition for players. During the seismic off-season, Saudi clubs have spent around  £350m to recruit the likes of Benzema, former Manchester City winger Riyad Mahrez and Sadio Mane from Bayern Munich. No team among Europe's supposed elite has proven capable of matching the financial might from the Middle East. The Saudi Pro League's chief operating officer Carlo Nohra explained to Reuters: \"We had to improve quality and in order to improve quality, you have to bring in the best. Spending was always going to be an essential component for us to do this.\" manual Klopp's outburst was underpinned by the disparity between the closing dates of the transfer windows in England and Saudi Arabia. While the Pro League can continue to tempt players away with lucrative deals until the fourth week of September, the Premier League's transfer window slams (it never closes quietly) shut on 1 September at 23:00 BST. When both windows are open, Premier League clubs can at least source replacements for the individuals that chased gold to the Gulf. Yet, there are 19 long days for Saudi sides to pilfer England's helpless top flight. According to FIFA's Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players, transfer windows are determined by each association. World football's governing body stipulates that there must be two registration periods (summer and winter windows) and the first \"shall begin on the first day of the season. This period may not exceed 12 weeks.\" The 2023\/24 season begins on 1 July 2023 for most leagues which run from autumn to spring. Therefore, the latest that the summer window could close would be on 23 September 2023. The Saudi Pro League have simply stretched the window to its limits while the Premier League plays by the same rules as the rest of Europe. League Closing date \/ time (BST) La Liga 01\/09\/2023 - 23:00 Serie A 01\/09\/2023 - 19:00 Bundesliga 01\/09\/2023 - 17:00 Ligue 1 01\/09\/2023 - 22:00 This year, all of the major European leagues will also close at varying times on 1 September. The Premier League voted to close their summer window in 2018 and 2019 when the season's fixtures began during August, theoretically providing every manager with a settled squad for each match in the first half of the campaign. However, the rest of Europe didn't follow suit, giving those on the continent ample opportunity to poach Premier League stars without any chance of retaliation. After two years, Premier League clubs voted to get back \"in sync\" with the rest of Europe. Now, the continent's elite teams are out of step with the Saudi Pro League - which has already spent more on transfers than La Liga. Whether this will lead to an extension of future summer windows remains to be seen. But there will be no solution for a grumpy Klopp this year.","label":[[0,12,"PER"],[195,204,"ORG"],[284,289,"PER"],[319,341,"ORG"],[434,446,"LOC"],[476,481,"PER"],[506,520,"ORG"],[568,572,"ORG"],[574,578,"ORG"],[610,615,"PER"],[641,652,"ORG"],[723,739,"PER"],[744,751,"PER"],[764,775,"LOC"],[813,829,"ORG"],[985,1001,"ORG"],[1027,1033,"DAT"],[1171,1184,"PER"],[1209,1219,"ORG"],[1227,1246,"PER"],[1255,1263,"ORG"],[1269,1277,"DAT"],[1472,1477,"MON"],[1480,1485,"MON"],[1536,1554,"ORG"],[1600,1612,"DAT"],[1690,1708,"ORG"],[1950,1955,"MON"],[1980,1987,"PER"],[1996,2011,"ORG"],[2019,2031,"PER"],[2036,2046,"PER"],[2052,2065,"ORG"],[2161,2176,"LOC"],[2178,2200,"ORG"],[2225,2236,"PER"],[2250,2257,"ORG"],[2432,2439,"PER"],[2535,2542,"LOC"],[2547,2559,"LOC"],[2571,2581,"ORG"],[2678,2694,"ORG"],[2751,2762,"DAT"],[2766,2775,"TIM"],[2805,2819,"ORG"],[2941,2946,"LOC"],[3007,3013,"ORG"],[3334,3341,"DAT"],[3359,3370,"DAT"],[3490,3507,"DAT"],[3513,3529,"ORG"],[3587,3601,"ORG"],[3641,3647,"LOC"],[3682,3689,"ORG"],[3690,3700,"DAT"],[3703,3708,"TIM"],[3709,3716,"ORG"],[3717,3727,"DAT"],[3730,3735,"TIM"],[3736,3746,"ORG"],[3747,3757,"DAT"],[3760,3765,"TIM"],[3766,3773,"ORG"],[3774,3784,"DAT"],[3787,3792,"TIM"],[3874,3885,"DAT"],[3891,3905,"ORG"],[3944,3948,"DAT"],[3953,3957,"DAT"],[3998,4004,"DAT"],[4136,4142,"LOC"],[4220,4234,"ORG"],[4293,4307,"ORG"],[4359,4365,"LOC"],[4425,4441,"ORG"],[4491,4498,"ORG"],[4627,4632,"PER"]],"Comments":[]}

{"id":87,"text":"West Ham United have agreed a  £30m deal with Southampton for their captain James Ward-Prowse, sources have confirmed to 90min. The Hammers have been desperately trying to strengthen their squad after selling Declan Rice to Arsenal in a British-record  £105m transfer. Things have been slow moving for West Ham, amid internal conflicts between manager David Moyes and new technical director Tim Steidten, but progress has been made over the past 48 hours on a number of targets. Edson Alvarez has completed a medical in London ahead of a  £34m move from Ajax, while West Ham have also agreed a  £30m fee for former Manchester United skipper Harry Maguire - he is now due to discuss personal terms over a move to the East End.

Ward-Prowse has been at Southampton for the entirety of his career, making 422 appearances on the south coast and scoring 55 goals. He has also provided 55 assists in that time, while his unerring accuracy from free-kicks has drawn comparisons to David Beckham.

{"id":89,"text":"Manchester United have agreed to sell Harry Maguire to West Ham United for a  £30m fee, sources have confirmed to 90min. The England international was removed from his position as club captain last month, with Bruno Fernandes taking over the role at Old Trafford. 90min revealed on Monday that West Ham had made a  £30m bid for Maguire with his long-term future at United uncertain, but the bid was turned down at the time. Part of the reason why United knocked back this offer was the belief that the Hammers would be unable to satisfy Maguire's wage demands, but after West Ham informed the Red Devils on Wednesday their willingness to amend their contract offer to the centre-back, the two clubs have come to an agreement. Though Maguire has not been 100% convinced of leaving Man Utd this transfer window, 90min understands he is open to a move and it looks likely that he will now accept West Ham's offer. feed Should Maguire complete a move to London Stadium, United will make a  £50m loss on the 30-year-old following his world-record move from Leicester City in 2019 which made him the most expensive defender in football history. Maguire fell out of favour under Erik ten Hag last season, with Lisandro Martinez displacing him from the starting lineup and often featuring alongside Raphael Varane. Victor Lindelof has also usurped Maguire in the pecking order, with Luke Shaw also preferred in a central role at times. West Ham remain interested in Man Utd midfielder Scott McTominay, who was also the subject of a  £30m bid this week, but the Red Devils are continuing to hold out for a higher fee for the Scotland international. Ajax's Edson Alvarez is close to finalising a move to east London, - he's undergone a medical and is set to pen a five-year deal - while West Ham have also agreed to pay Southampton  £30m for their captain James Ward-Prowse - a move that may prevent an improved offer being made for McTominay.","label":[[0,17,"ORG"],[38,51,"PER"],[55,70,"ORG"],[78,82,"MON"],[114,119,"ORG"],[125,132,"ORG"],[210,225,"PER"],[250,262,"LOC"],[264,269,"ORG"],[294,302,"ORG"],[315,319,"MON"],[328,335,"PER"],[365,371,"ORG"],[447,453,"ORG"],[498,509,"ORG"],[537,546,"PER"],[571,579,"ORG"],[589,603,"ORG"],[733,740,"PER"],[754,758,"PCT"],[780,787,"ORG"],[810,815,"ORG"],[893,903,"ORG"],[923,930,"PER"],[950,964,"LOC"],[966,972,"ORG"],[986,990,"MON"],[1052,1066,"ORG"],[1070,1074,"DAT"],[1139,1146,"PER"],[1172,1184,"PER"],[1203,1220,"PER"],[1291,1305,"PER"],[1307,1322,"PER"],[1340,1347,"PER"],[1375,1384,"PER"],[1428,1436,"ORG"],[1458,1465,"ORG"],[1477,1492,"PER"],[1525,1529,"MON"],[1549,1563,"ORG"],[1616,1624,"ORG"],[1640,1646,"ORG"],[1647,1660,"PER"],[1694,1705,"LOC"],[1777,1785,"ORG"],[1810,1821,"ORG"],[1823,1827,"MON"],[1846,1863,"PER"],[1923,1932,"PER"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":90,"text":"Liverpool have held talks over potentially trumping Chelsea's latest offer for Brighton midfielder Moises Caicedo, 90min understands. Chelsea have seen multiple bids for Caicedo rejected already this summer, with Brighton holding out for  £100m. While talks between the two sides remain on, Chelsea have also stepped up their pursuit of potential alternatives. Indeed, a bid was recently lodged for Southampton midfielder Romeo Lavia - the subject of three failed offers from Liverpool. With Chelsea threatening to hijack the pursuit of Lavia, sources have confirmed to 90min that Liverpool have made a late move over potentially beating Mauricio Pochettino's side to Caicedo. Sources have stressed that Liverpool have not yet submitted a formal offer for Caicedo but have held talks with Brighton as they explore a possible move to exceed Chelsea's  £80m proposal. feed 90min understands that Caicedo's preference would be to join Chelsea over Liverpool, but it remains to be seen whether that stance would change if the Reds see an offer accepted. Chelsea sources insist that the Blues remain well in the fight for Caicedo as well as Lavia, with Leeds United's Tyler Adams another target on the table. Liverpool are desperate to continue bolstering their midfield after the surprise departures of Jordan Henderson and Fabinho to Saudi Arabia, and Jurgen Klopp's side have spent a large part of the summer focused on Lavia.

{"id":92,"text":"West Ham United do not intend to sell Lucas Paqueta despite Manchester City making a verbal offer of  £70m for the Brazilian, sources have confirmed to 90min. The 25-year-old established himself as a key player in David Moyes' side during the second half of last season, helping the club to a famous win over Fiorentina in the Europa Conference League final. But despite that success, and West Ham's subsequent qualification for the Europa League, Paqueta wasn't overly impressed with how the 2022\/23 season went, with 90min exclusively revealing in June that the Brazilian has particular concerns about working under Moyes. Paqueta has had to adapt his style of play to fit into Moyes' system, and although his performance levels significantly improved after the winter World Cup in Qatar, it's clear that the Brazilian's natural instincts are compromised by West Ham sitting deep and looking to hit teams on the counter. The former AC Milan and Lyon midfielder parted company with his long-term agents earlier this summer, and it's understood his new representation have been assessing potential landing spots for Paqueta during the current transfer window.  Paris Saint-Germain showed interest in Paqueta earlier this summer and retain an interest in his services, while the recently appointed director of the Saudi Pro League, Michael Emenalo, is keeping apprised of the midfielder's situation at West Ham. 90min has also learned of significant interest from Premier League champions Manchester City, who have made a verbal offer of  £70m for Paqueta. West Ham have turned that bid down and have insisted that they do not intend to sell Paqueta, however sources have told 90min that an offer 'too good to turn down' would be considered. feed Whether or not City return for Paqueta remains to be seen, but they certainly have the financial capability to offer West Ham an increased figure - the money at their disposal evidenced by their  £90m bid for Declan Rice earlier this summer. It's also rare for City to engage in talks unless they have a genuine belief of signing a player. City's interest stems from their desire to replace Ilkay Gundogan and Riyad Mahrez, who have left for Barcelona and Al Ahli respectively, but isn't believed to be connected to a potential sale of Bernardo Silva. 90min recently revealed that Barcelona have made fresh contact with Silva in an attempt to prise the Portuguese international away from City, but they have no intention to sell at this point. Paris Saint-Germain are also interested in the 28-year-old. 90min further understands that Newcastle's long-term interest in Paqueta has not waned, but a deal may be difficult for them to do because of Financial Fair Play regulations. A loan with obligation to buy  appears to be the only way the Magpies could facilitate a move this summer, though that is unlikely to happen at this stage.","label":[[0,15,"ORG"],[38,51,"PER"],[60,75,"ORG"],[102,106,"MON"],[152,157,"ORG"],[214,225,"PER"],[309,319,"ORG"],[323,351,"ORG"],[389,399,"ORG"],[429,446,"ORG"],[448,455,"PER"],[493,500,"DAT"],[519,524,"ORG"],[550,554,"DAT"],[618,623,"PER"],[625,632,"PER"],[680,685,"PER"],[760,780,"ORG"],[784,789,"LOC"],[860,868,"ORG"],[934,942,"ORG"],[947,951,"ORG"],[1116,1123,"PER"],[1161,1180,"ORG"],[1200,1207,"PER"],[1313,1329,"ORG"],[1331,1346,"PER"],[1401,1409,"ORG"],[1411,1416,"ORG"],[1463,1477,"ORG"],[1488,1503,"ORG"],[1538,1542,"MON"],[1547,1554,"PER"],[1556,1564,"ORG"],[1641,1648,"PER"],[1676,1681,"ORG"],[1761,1765,"ORG"],[1777,1784,"PER"],[1863,1871,"ORG"],[1942,1946,"MON"],[1955,1966,"PER"],[2007,2011,"ORG"],[2086,2092,"ORG"],[2137,2151,"PER"],[2156,2168,"PER"],[2188,2197,"ORG"],[2202,2209,"ORG"],[2282,2296,"PER"],[2298,2303,"ORG"],[2327,2336,"ORG"],[2366,2371,"PER"],[2399,2409,"ORG"],[2434,2438,"ORG"],[2490,2509,"ORG"],[2550,2555,"ORG"],[2581,2592,"ORG"],[2615,2622,"PER"],[2783,2794,"ORG"]],"Comments":[]}

Courtois is set to undergo surgery after tearing his ACL in training and is subsequently expected to miss the vast majority of the upcoming campaign, leaving Madrid with Lunin as their only senior goalkeeper. As 90min reported following Courtois' injury, Madrid have not yet ruled out keeping Lunin as their starting goalkeeper, although club officials are drawing up a list of potential targets as they seek to bolster in the position once again. After contact was made with free agent David de Gea, Madrid focused their efforts on Sevilla stopper Yassine Bounou, who is keen to make the move this summer. However, with Lunin set to start the campaign in goal as Madrid open their season against Athletic Club on Saturday, Ancelotti reiterated his faith in the 24-year-old. feed \"Emotionally, it was not a good day,\" Ancelotti told a press conference. \"We are sad on a personal level as it is an injury to an important player, but these things happen in football. \"We wish [Courtois] a speedy recovery and we give all the confidence in the world to Lunin, who is a great goalkeeper. In pre-season, he did well. Total confidence in him, we think he is a talent. What he lacks is what everyone lacks, experience, but he will take it game by game.\" Asked whether he would like a new signing, Ancelotti responded: \"We have time until 31 August. Behind Lunin, our goalkeepers have potential, but they are young. We will think about it. Fran [Gonzalez] is 17 years old. \"If we sign a new goalkeeper, we will do it for numbers because we have confidence in Lunin. The confidence in Lunin is total.\" Ancelotti ended with a simple assessment of the sort of goalkeeper he would like to see Madrid bring in.    One that stops the ball with his hands,\" the Italian quipped. \"First and foremost, one that makes saves. That is what I ask of all goalkeepers. Let them be good with their hands. When it comes to feet, it's better to have a striker.\"","label":[[0,15,"PER"],[29,40,"ORG"],[83,95,"PER"],[154,170,"PER"],[180,188,"PER"],[338,344,"ORG"],[350,355,"PER"],[392,397,"ORG"],[417,425,"PER"],[435,441,"ORG"],[473,478,"PER"],[667,679,"PER"],[681,687,"ORG"],[713,720,"ORG"],[729,743,"PER"],[801,806,"PER"],[844,850,"ORG"],[877,890,"ORG"],[904,913,"PER"],[998,1007,"PER"],[1155,1163,"PER"],[1230,1235,"PER"],[1470,1479,"PER"],[1511,1520,"DAT"],[1529,1534,"PER"],[1612,1616,"PER"],[1618,1626,"PER"],[1731,1736,"PER"],[1756,1761,"PER"],[1773,1782,"PER"],[1861,1867,"ORG"]],"Comments":[]}

{"id":96,"text":"Harry Kane has not yet accepted Bayern Munich's offer of a summer transfer, 90min understands, with Tottenham Hotspur hopeful their talisman will instead agree to stay. Having seen Kane enter the final year of his contract, Spurs have begrudgingly accepted a bid from Bayern worth    100m ( £86.4m) but have long been determined to convince the England international to reject their advances and stay. While Bayern were confident an agreement with Spurs was all that was missing in their pursuit of Kane, sources have confirmed to 90min that the 30-year-old has not yet given his approval to a move to Munich. Kane is understood to be considering his options, one of which is to remain with Spurs beyond this summer, and sources close to the club are now hopeful that Kane will agree to remain at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium for at least one more season. The striker informed both Spurs and Bayern earlier this week that he wanted his future resolved by the time the new Premier League season kicks off this weekend, with Spurs due to play Brentford on Sunday. feed Bayern themselves wanted a deal wrapped up when they lodged a third bid which was also worth    100m, but based around a less-favourable payment structure for the Premier League side. But they did not get the immediate response they were hoping for as Spurs chairman Daniel Levy delayed his eventual rejection. They have now seen a bid accepted which would satisfy Kane's deadline but the striker has not yet given the green light - a hesitance which has left Spurs optimistic about their chances of keeping the striker. Should Kane stay, he would be able to discuss a free transfer overseas in January, with Spurs at risk of losing him for free next summer, when Premier League rivals would also be able to offer a contract. Spurs have long been determined to keep Kane and have never given up on convincing the England captain to sign a new contract further down the line.","label":[[0,10,"PER"],[32,47,"ORG"],[76,81,"ORG"],[100,117,"ORG"],[181,185,"PER"],[224,229,"ORG"],[268,274,"ORG"],[284,288,"MON"],[291,297,"MON"],[345,352,"ORG"],[408,414,"ORG"],[448,453,"ORG"],[499,503,"PER"],[531,536,"ORG"],[602,608,"ORG"],[610,614,"PER"],[691,696,"ORG"],[768,772,"PER"],[801,826,"LOC"],[883,888,"ORG"],[893,899,"ORG"],[973,987,"ORG"],[1024,1029,"ORG"],[1042,1051,"ORG"],[1068,1074,"ORG"],[1164,1168,"MON"],[1231,1245,"ORG"],[1320,1325,"ORG"],[1335,1346,"PER"],[1433,1439,"PER"],[1528,1533,"ORG"],[1596,1600,"PER"],[1663,1670,"DAT"],[1677,1682,"ORG"],[1732,1746,"ORG"],[1794,1799,"ORG"],[1834,1838,"PER"],[1881,1888,"ORG"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":97,"text":"West Ham United have contacted Montpellier over striker Elye Wahi and are weighing up an offer, 90min understands. The Hammers confirmed their first major signing of the summer on Thursday, committing Edson Alvarez to a five-year contract after agreeing to pay Ajax up to  £34m for his services.  £30m deals are also in place for Southampton captain James Ward-Prowse and Manchester United defender Harry Maguire, while West Ham also have eyes on signing a new striker, wide forward and left back before the window closes on September 1     the club have money to spend after selling Declan Rice to Arsenal for a British-record fee of  £105m. 90min previously revealed that West Ham had shown an interest in 20-year-old Wahi, who bagged 19 goals for Montpellier in Ligue 1, amid concerns that Saudi Pro League side Al Ettifaq, managed by Steven Gerrard, may try to prise Michail Antonio away from London Stadium. That move hasn't come to fruition but Gianluca Scamacca has departed West Ham, joining Atalanta on a permanent basis. His exit has left the club a little light up front, with Antonio, Danny Ings and academy striker Divin Mubama the options at David Moyes' disposal. Sources have now confirmed to 90min that West Ham have made contact with Montpellier over Wahi - a player admired by technical director Tim Steidten - with a view to making an offer for the France Under-21 international. feed But getting a deal over the line won't be easy. Wahi has generated considerable interest this summer, with Arsenal and Chelsea among his Premier League suitors - the latter have been made a verbal offer. Ligue 1 giants Monaco are also considering a bid, though crucially they can't offer European football this season like West Ham can, and Eintracht Frankfurt think Wahi could be the ideal fit to replace Randal Kolo Muani. Kolo Muani has been strongly linked with Paris Saint-Germain and Bayern Munich this summer, as well as Manchester United, and 90min understands that West Ham have enquired about his potential price tag too - PSG are leading the charge though as they cast Kylian Mbappe to one side in a furious dispute over his future, and it looks increasingly likely that Kolo Muani will return to Ligue 1 if a fee can be agreed. Montpellier are expected to demand a fee of at least  £35m for Wahi, though they still may look to keep him after renewing his contract just six months ago. West Ham's other major piece of business surrounds the interest from Premier League champions Manchester City in Lucas Paqueta. A verbal  £70m offer was swiftly rejected by the Hammers, who don't want to sell the Brazilian, but it's expected that the treble winners will imminently return with an improved bid.","label":[[0,15,"ORG"],[31,42,"ORG"],[56,65,"PER"],[96,101,"ORG"],[115,126,"ORG"],[201,214,"PER"],[261,265,"ORG"],[273,277,"MON"],[297,301,"MON"],[330,341,"ORG"],[350,367,"PER"],[372,389,"ORG"],[399,412,"PER"],[420,428,"ORG"],[525,536,"DAT"],[584,595,"PER"],[599,606,"ORG"],[636,641,"MON"],[643,648,"ORG"],[674,682,"ORG"],[720,724,"PER"],[750,761,"ORG"],[765,772,"ORG"],[793,809,"ORG"],[815,825,"ORG"],[838,852,"PER"],[871,886,"PER"],[897,911,"LOC"],[951,968,"PER"],[982,990,"ORG"],[1000,1008,"ORG"],[1088,1095,"PER"],[1097,1107,"PER"],[1128,1140,"PER"],[1156,1167,"PER"],[1209,1214,"ORG"],[1220,1228,"ORG"],[1252,1263,"ORG"],[1269,1273,"PER"],[1315,1327,"PER"],[1369,1375,"ORG"],[1453,1457,"PER"],[1512,1519,"ORG"],[1524,1531,"ORG"],[1542,1556,"ORG"],[1609,1616,"ORG"],[1624,1630,"ORG"],[1728,1736,"ORG"],[1746,1764,"ORG"],[1772,1776,"PER"],[1811,1828,"PER"],[1830,1840,"PER"],[1871,1890,"ORG"],[1895,1908,"ORG"],[1933,1950,"ORG"],[1956,1961,"ORG"],[1979,1987,"ORG"],[2038,2041,"ORG"],[2085,2098,"PER"],[2187,2197,"PER"],[2213,2220,"ORG"],[2245,2256,"ORG"],[2299,2303,"MON"],[2308,2312,"PER"],[2402,2412,"ORG"],[2471,2485,"ORG"],[2496,2511,"ORG"],[2515,2528,"PER"],[2540,2544,"MON"],[2575,2586,"ORG"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":98,"text":"Real Madrid are now in the market for a new goalkeeper after Thibaut Courtois suffered a potential season-ending injury this week.  The Belgian shot-stopper suffered an ACL injury which will unfortunately require surgery and an extremely lengthy spell on the sidelines.  In the imemdiate term Andriy Lunin will stand in. But here's the options available to Madrid in what remains of this summer transfer window in order to replace the stricken Courtois... feed Diogo Costa is the best goalkeeper on this list. That is a fact. The Porto star is an archtypal modern goalie who is as equally with the ball at his feet as he is in between the sticks. So why is he the last on these options, you ask? Well the fact that he has a  £65m (   75m) release clause in his contract - something which we highly doubt Real Madrid would pay. Likelihood: 1\/10 The 22-year-old has been consistently linked with a move away from Valencia in recent months, so it only makes sense to add him to list of potential Courtois deputies. The  £25m asking price that Valencia have put on the goalkeeper makes any move unlikely however, especially when there's much, much cheaper options who would do as good a job currently on the market. Likelihood: 2\/10  Recently linked with a move to Bayern, regular Premier League viewers are well aware of Kepa Arrizabalaga's deficiencies. He's not all bad though, and if Chelsea are desperate to get ride of him this summer then he could be available for an okay price.Kepa was actually heavily linked with Madrid once before, way back in 2018.Likelihood: 4\/10  Even before the news broke that Thibaut Courtois was set to miss the majority of the season, David Soria was being linked with a move to the Santiago Bernabeu. A deal was reported to have fallen through in July due to a mixture of Getafe wanting  £8m for his services and Soria not being keen on becoming a second choice goalkeeper. With the opportunity to become Madrid's first-choice shot-stopper for a season now available, Soria may be more keen to join the club. Likelihood: 6\/10  Three UEFA Champions Leagues, one La Liga and four FIFA Club World Cups. It's fair to say that Keylor Navas enjoyed his previous stint at Real Madrid. His success at the club in the mid-2010s, coupled with his availability due to lowly position in the PSG goalkeeper ranks means this deal would make a lot of sense. Likelihood: 8\/10  Once upon a time, David de Gea was a fax machine away from joining Real Madrid for around  £30m.Now, Madrid can sign the goalkeeper as a free agent and not have worry about paying a fee or rely on a fax machine to work properly. He's the logical choice.

{"id":100,"text":"Harry Kane is set to leave Tottenham Hotspur this summer after agreeing to join German champions Bayern Munich, 90min understands. Bayern lodged four bids for the England striker, eventually agreeing to a    100m ( £86.4m) deal to lure Kane away, but the striker himself did not immediately give his approval to a move as he considered all his options. While the initial delay left Spurs feeling hopeful they may have convinced their captain to stay, 90min understands that Kane has now accepted Bayern's proposal and is set to leave the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium this summer. Kane, who set a deadline of Sunday to resolve his future, is due in Germany on Friday to undergo a medical ahead of signing a four-year contract with the Bundesliga champions. However, Spurs have currently delayed signing off on the deal and are keen to finalise each and every minor detail before allowing Kane to depart. Bayern are hopeful that Kane will be in attendance for Saturday's Super Cup clash with RB Leipzig, perhaps even playing a role in the match if all goes to plan. feed The move to Germany, if sealed as expected, will bring an end to Kane's 19-year association with Tottenham, in which he has racked up 280 goals in 435 appearances. Kane's pursuit of Alan Shearer's all-time Premier League top scorer record will also be halted, perhaps permanently. The 30-year-old has struck 213 times in the competition, 47 fewer than Blackburn and Newcastle icon Shearer.
