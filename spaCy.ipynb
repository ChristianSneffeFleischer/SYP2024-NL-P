Dembele had been in talks over extending his Barcelona contract before PSG voiced a desire to trigger the    50m release clause in the Frenchman\\'s contract, and although that clause expired last month, Dembele\\'s desire to seal the move saw Barcelona agree to the same terms. Having entered the final year of his contract at Camp Nou, Barcelona preferred to cash in on Dembele when it became clear he would leave for free next summer if he remained at the club. For Dembele, it\\'s a return to Ligue 1 for the first time since he departed Rennes in 2016, with the 26-year-old inking a five-year contract at Parc des Princes. feed \"I\\'m delighted to be joining Paris Saint-Germain and can\\'t wait to play for my new club,\" Dembele told club media. \"I hope I can continue to grow here and make all the club\\'s fans proud.\" President Nasser Al-Khelaifi added: \"We are delighted to welcome Ousmane Dembele to Paris Saint-Germain where he will be an important and committed player for our club. \"The passion and determination shown by Ousmane as he has signed for PSG is fantastic and perfectly corresponds to the attitude required of all of our players. We are proud to be able to bring another French World Cup winner to Paris Saint-Germain as we enter a new great era for our club.    90min understands that PSG are also making progress in talks with Eintracht Frankfurt over striker Randal Kolo Muani, with the Bundesliga side now working on finding a replacement.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Chelsea are close to finalising an agreement with Southampton for the transfer of Romeo Lavia, sources have confirmed to 90min. The Blues have a long-standing interest in the midfielder having tried to sign him last summer just weeks after he first joined the Saints from Manchester City. They continued to monitor Lavia throughout his debut Premier League season, with the teenager breaking into the Belgium senior side despite Southampton's relegation. Liverpool have seen three bids for Lavia rejected by Southampton this summer as they did not meet their  £50m valuation, and the Merseysiders could now be beaten to his signature by Chelsea. feed 90min understands that a deal to take Lavia from St Mary's to Stamford Bridge worth  £55m is close to being agreed, roughly 24 hours after Chelsea reignited their interest in the 19-year-old. Lavia has not made a competitive appearance for Southampton this season due to intense speculation regarding a move away. Chelsea and Liverpool's transfer business in recent days has been intertwined. The Reds appeared to have beaten the Blues to Brighton's Moises Caicedo after launching a British-record  £111m bid on Friday morning, but the Ecuadorian is holding out for a move to west London instead. Though they intend to match Liverpool's mammoth offer in the coming hours, Brighton are yet to receive a new bid from Chelsea. Elsewhere, Chelsea have dropped their interest in Leeds United's Tyler Adams despite agreeing to pay his  £20m relegation release clause this week, with the USMNT captain now returning to Yorkshire.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Manchester United are in talks with Bayern Munich over the possible transfer of 2018 World Cup-winning defender Benjamin Pavard, 90min understands. The versatile Pavard, capable of playing as a centre-back or right-back, joined Bayern in 2019 and has entered the final year of his contract at the Allianz Arena. With Maguire in the process of leaving Old Trafford before next month   s transfer deadline, Pavard had been among a number of options to replace the former captain. As 90min revealed last week, United are preparing to enter the transfer market once Maguire   s exit is completed. The England international had initially wanted to stay and fight for his place, despite slipping down the pecking order last season and losing the captaincy early in pre-season. feed But the Red Devils agreed a  £30m fee with fellow Premier League side West Ham United. Talks have continued to hammer out the details of the proposed deal, although things have progressed slower than had been hoped. That being said, all parties expect a conclusion to still be reached soon. Pavard has been offered to United, with Nice   s Jean-Clair Todibo, ex-Ajax defender Perr Schuurs, Jarrad Branthwaite of Everton, one-time Tottenham target Edmond Tapsoba and Benfica   s Antonio Silva all considered by the club to replace Maguire. But it is the Pavard path on which United are now progressing and 90min understands that negotiations with Bayern over the transfer fee are taking place. The perennial German champions value the Frenchman at  £30m (   35m), which is higher than the  £25.9m (   30m) that United have so far proposed. That figure hasn   t yet convinced Bayern to sell, but the difference in valuation has not dissuaded the sides from continuing to talk.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Moises Caicedo is no stranger to a drawn-out transfer saga. Years before Chelsea began peppering Brighton with dizzying offers only to be outbid by Liverpool, before the Blues bid  £115m to secure his services this week, Caicedo was the subject of a multi-club tussle while he was still in Ecuador with Independiente del Valle. Manchester United, AC Milan, Brighton, Chelsea and Belgian side Club Brugge were all interested in the midfielder after a rapid ascension in senior South American football. Three separate agencies also tried to represent Caicedo and get a slice of any potentially lucrative deal. Ultimately, Brighton cut through the chaos to snag Caicedo for just  £4.5m in 2021. After less than 50 starts for the Seagulls, the 21-year-old has now become one of the most expensive players in the history of the sport. Here's how Caicedo's  £115m move to Chelsea compares to the game's other costly sagas. Chelsea confirmed the signing of Caicedo after one of the most dramatic transfer sagas of recent times. The Blues had been pursuing the midfielder for the majority of the summer, however had been unwilling to make a bid over  £80m until Liverpool agreed to fork out  £111m for his services.  Despite an agreement between Liverpool and Brighton being struck, Caicedo was unwilling to agree to a move to Anfield, opening the door for Chelsea to swoop in and have a  £115m bid accepted for his services.  The midfielder has now put pen to paper on an eight-year deal at Stamford Bridge.  Caicedo has become the most expensive signing for Chelsea and any other British club. But where does he rank on a global scale? Ranking Player Signed Joined Fee 1 Neymar 2017 PSG  £198m 2 Kylian Mbappe 2018 PSG  £163m 3 Philippe Coutinho 2018 Barcelona  £142m 4 Ousmane Dembele 2017 Barcelona  £135m 5 Moises Caicedo 2023 Chelsea  £115m 6 Joao Felix 2019 Atletico Madrid  £113m 7 Enzo Fernandez 2023 Chelsea  £107m 8 Antoine Griezmann 2019 Barcelona  £107m 9 Declan Rice 2023 Arsenal  £105m 10 Jack Grealish 2021 Manchester City  £100m Less than four years after making his senior debut as a 17-year-old in the Ecuadorian top flight, Caicedo has become the fifth most expensive footballer of all time.  Even though Caicedo's fee has scratched nine digits, Neymar's move to PSG comfortably remains the most expensive in history, with the Ligue 1 giants paying  £198m for the forward's services.  Neymar's PSG teammate Kylian Mbappe is second on the list but could have moved into top spot after Al Hilal's  £259m offer was accepted by the French champions. Mbappe ultimately refused to even meet with representatives of the Saudi giants.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Saudi Pro League director of football Michael Emenalo claims the competition can position itself as one of the world\\'s best within the next two years by targeting \\'exceptional players only\\' The former technical director of Chelsea assumed his role in July and is continuing the Pro League\\'s significant  £400m investment initiative. This strategy has enticed players such as Karim Benzema, Jordan Henderson, Riyad Mahrez, and Roberto Firmino to join Saudi Arabian clubs this summer. So far, the majority of top stars heading to Saudi Arabia, including Benzema, N\\'Golo Kante and Cristiano Ronaldo, have been in the latter stages of their respective careers. At 26, Ruben Neves is one of the exceptions to the trend and arguably not in the same bracket of star anyway. Richard Masters, chief executive of the Premier League, recently shared that he isn\\'t overly worried about Saudi Arabia\\'s unrestricted spending. However, Emenalo cautioned that there are essentially no bounds to the country\\'s willingness to invest in football players.  \"I would love  to have Kylian Mbappe here. I would love to have Harry Kane here. The league would like all the top players,\" he said. Indeed, Mbappe has already been the subject of world record  £259m bid from Al Hilal that was accepted by Paris Saint-Germain, although the plater himself wasn\\'t interested in the move. manual \"In a couple of years, this will become a league for exceptional players only. It will become a league for those who are at the top of their game. We have the resources, and we   re going to use them,\" Emenalo said. \"I don   t think it is going to take the same amount of time that it took the [English] Premier League to get there for us to establish ourselves.\" Emenalo emphasised that the Saudi Pro League\\'s aim is not to undermine the Premier League in a manner similar to LIV Golf and the PGA Tour and hopes that elite football\\'s established order in Europe will eventually be less apprehensive and collaborate with them.    The European leagues, especially the Premier League, are very strong, they have no reason to be scared,    he added.    I think there   s panic in some areas, but this is from a misunderstanding of what we are trying to do.    I saw what [Jurgen] Klopp and what [Pep] Guardiola said [about the Pro League]. One is a coach I absolutely admire and the other is a good friend of mine in Pep. First, I hope they don   t talk themselves out of a job [in Saudi Arabia] in the future. I understand their concerns. Our goal is to work together with all the leagues and be a brotherhood in the football industry.   ',\n",

       "  'text': \"Harry Maguire's proposed transfer to West Ham United has collapsed, 90min understands. After telling Maguire he is free to leave Old Trafford this summer, Manchester United initially rejected a  £30m bid from West Ham amid concerns over their ability to satisfy the centre-back's wage demands, only to eventually agree to the offer on the table. West Ham have since completed the signings of Edson Alvarez and James Ward-Prowse but talks over Maguire continued to drag on as they sought to thrash out a wage agreement with both the defender and United. 90min understands that Maguire had agreed the terms of a reduced contract with West Ham but sought a pay-off from United to compensate him for the loss in salary over the remaining two years of his deal at Old Trafford. Sources have now confirmed that no agreement was reached between Maguire and United, forcing West Ham to accept defeat in their pursuit of the centre-back. feed United had been preparing for Maguire's exit by speaking with Bayern Munich over French defender Benjamin Pavard but, as 90min revealed earlier this summer, the Red Devils fear they do not have the financial room to sign another defender with Maguire's high wages still on the books. There has been tentative interest in Maguire from elsewhere but United are not expecting more bids for the 30-year-old, who appears set to remain at Old Trafford beyond this summer. Manager Erik ten Hag is known to be happy to continue working with Maguire as a backup to Raphael Varane and Lisandro Martinez, but he recently warned the England international that he is in for a fight for minutes if he chooses to stay. Maguire remains under contract at United until 2025, with the club holding the option to extend his deal by a further 12 months.\",\n",

The former Manchester City and New York City winger will join Everton for the 2023/24 campaign after activating a clause in his contract following Leeds' relegation from the Premier League. Aston Villa also made a move for Harrison, but upon learning that he would not be fit for another six weeks, they backed away from a deal - Villa are looking at options in the transfer market having lost Emi Buendia to an ACL injury and they wanted someone who could make an immediate impact. Harrison passed a medical with Everton on Sunday but he does have a hip problem that will likely see him sidelined until after the September international break. feed Everton turned to Harrison after accepting defeat in their pursuit of his teammate Willy Gnonto. The Italy international agreed personal terms over a move to Goodison Park, but Leeds would not allow him to leave. Gnonto was one of the few Leeds players in their squad that did not have some sort of release clause, unlike Harrison. Harrison is the latest Leeds player to depart the West Yorkshire giants this summer after returning to the Championship. Rodrigo, Robin Koch, Max Wober, Tyler Roberts, Joel Robles, Brenden Aaronson, Rasmus Kristensen and Marc Roca have all departed the club.\",\n",

Liverpool had agreed a deal with Brighton to sign Caicedo on Thursday evening worth  £111m and the 21-year-old was due on Merseyside for a medical on Friday morning. However, it quickly became apparent that Caicedo was not going to travel to the north of England as he and his agents made it clear to Brighton that he would still prefer a move to Chelsea. The Blue had previously seen a number of bids rejected, the biggest of which had been worth  £80m and was still someway short of the minimum  £100m asking price required by the Seagulls. Now, whilst an agreement is not yet finalised, 90min has been informed that talks are progressing between Chelsea and Brighton and the deal is set to be worth in excess of the  £111m fee agreed with Liverpool earlier in the week. Once confirmed, it would break Chelsea\\'s own British record which they set in January when signing Enzo Fernandez from Benfica in a deal worth  £106m 90min can also confirm that talks between Caicedo have accelerated to the point that personal terms are all finalised and the Ecuadorian is ready to put pen to paper on an eight-year contract as soon as the two clubs confirm an agreement over price is in place. feed Chelsea are hopeful that they could parade both Caicedo and Romeo Lavia, who is close to finalising move from Southampton after a  £55m fee was agreed, ahead of Sunday\\'s Premier League clash with, ironically, Liverpool, who not only wanted Caicedo but also had multiple bids for Lavia rejected. For their part, Brighton are already moving forward with the belief that Caicedo is no longer theirs and boss Roberto De Zerbi considers him a former player. \"I have already forgotten about Moises,\" he said. \"I\\'m really proud of the players we have in the squad. We want to keep improving. The credit goes to the club. Bigger clubs can buy our players but they can\\'t buy our soul or spirit. \"We don\\'t have enough [players] yet, we need to complete the squad. I want players who want to come here. We are Brighton, we achieved a big target last year - the same as Liverpool, better than Chelsea. I would like players who are proud to play in Brighton.\"',\n",

       "  'text': \"Romeo Lavia is to undergo a medical at Chelsea after turning down the chance to join Liverpool, sources have confirmed to 90min. The 19-year-old's future has been the subject of intense speculation for weeks, with a departure from Southampton expected after the club's relegation to the Championship. Chelsea and Liverpool have both been pushing hard to sign Lavia, with the two clubs also doing battle to sign Moises Caicedo from Brighton in a deal that will make the British transfer record currently held by Enzo Fernandez. And just as Caicedo has chosen to move to Stamford Bridge, Lavia has decided his future is also in west London, turning down the opportunity to work under Jurgen Klopp in the process. 90min understands that the Belgian teenager will undergo a medical with Chelsea in the next 24 hours before sealing a move that could eventually be worth  £55m to Southampton. feed Caicedo is also set to imminently put pen to paper on an eight-year contract, joining forces with Fernandez and manager Mauricio Pochettino to create one of the most expensively assembled midfields in world football. Liverpool had indicated a willingness to match Chelsea's offer for Lavia, in the hope that he would choose to join the Reds, but they have again been left disappointed in their hunt for a new defensive midfielder. Fabinho has left the club this summer to join Al Ittihad in Saudi Arabia amid a complete overhaul of Liverpool's midfield. Jordan Henderson, Naby Keita, James Milner and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain have also moved on to pastures new, gutting the core of a side that failed to qualify for this season's Champions League. Alexis Mac Allister, Dominik Szoboszlai and Cody Gakpo started in an extremely attacking midfield three in the 1-1 draw with Chelsea on Sunday, though it was clear in that game that Liverpool need a more defensive-minded player to help protect the backline when the ball is turned over.\",\n",

PSG, who have been looking for buyers for Neymar, have welcomed interest from the Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF) and are understood to have accepted a    90m ( £77.6m) bid from Al Hilal to get the deal done. All parties are now finalising a move which is expected to be formally completed in the coming days. feed Saudi sources have laughed off suggestions Neymar could be loaned out after joining Al Hilal amid rumours of potential interest from Barcelona. Neymar's expected departure is the latest event in a tumultuous summer for PSG, who also remain in talks with Al Hilal over the potential sale of midfielder Marco Verratti. Lionel Messi left on a free transfer to join Inter Miami and it appeared as though he would be followed out the door by Kylian Mbappe who, after confirming he did not plan to trigger the extension in his contract, was frozen out of the first team.

       "  'text': 'Brighton and Hove Albion CEO Paul Barber has confessed Moises Caicedo\\'s decision to reject a transfer to Liverpool in favour of joining Chelsea came as a surprise. Chelsea confirmed the  £115m signing of Caicedo on Monday after a tense weekend which began with Liverpool coming out of nowhere to agree a fee of  £111m to sign the Ecuador international. However, Caicedo soon made it clear that he would prefer a move to Stamford Bridge, urging Brighton to reopen negotiations with Chelsea and ultimately sealing the move he was looking for. Barber admitted to talkSPORT that Caicedo\\'s stance left Brighton in an unexpected and \"difficult\" situation as they tried to find an outcome which satisfied everyone. feed \"Liverpool are a fantastic club, you   d imagine anyone would be running up the M6 for the chance to play at Anfield, but for whatever reason, Moises and his advisors decided London was their preferred destination,\" he said. \"In that situation we   re in a difficult position; we   ve negotiated a British record deal deal and spent several days working with Liverpool, who were were professional throughout. \"At that point [when Caicedo rejected the move], we   re out of the loop, it is all between the player and Liverpool. When it became clear he isn   t going to be joining Liverpool, we have to go into a different mode, we then have to do it all again, which we did. \"We started working with Chelsea, and we had to protect our own interests which is the player. We did that and now Moises goes on to the next step in his career.\" Liverpool and Chelsea have also butted heads over Southampton midfielder Romeo Lavia who, like Caicedo, has opted to move to Stamford Bridge this summer.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Paris Saint-Germain have confirmed that Kylian Mbappe has been allowed to return to first-team training after \"constructive and positive discussions\" regarding his future.  90min reported earlier this week that Mbappe had reiterated his desire to stay at PSG beyond this summer despite not taking up his option to trigger a clause which would extend his current contract at the club until the summer of 2025. That decision not to trigger an extension had led to PSG shopping the superstar forward around this summer due to the fear of losing him as a free agent next summer. The Ligue 1 giants accepted a world record offer  of  £257m (   300m) from Al Hilal last month, but despite proposing a gargantuan contract offer to Mbappe, the PIF-backed Saudi Pro League side were  unable to persuade the France star to enter negotiations. On top of trying to sell Mbappe, PSG had also banished the player from first-team training and even refused to select him for their recent pre-season tour of Japan.  manual Now, however, the 2018 World Cup winner is back in the first-team squad and back in training with his teammates after what the club have described as positive talks regarding the player\\'s future which took place on Saturday.  A club statement on the news reads: \"After very constructive and positive discussions between Paris Saint-Germain and Kylian Mbappe before the PSG - Lorient match, this Saturday 12th August, the player was reinstated in first-team training this morning.\"  Mbappe was in the stands on Saturday for PSG\\'s 0-0 draw with Lorient in their Ligue 1 season opener, sitting alongside new teammate Ousmane Dembele, whom the club officially confirmed the signing of on Saturday morning. The pair could feature together for the first time at club level next Saturday when Luis Enrique\\'s team take on Toulouse.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Real Madrid are prepared to end their pursuit of Sevilla goalkeeper Yassine Bounou after seeing his asking price raised, 90min understands, with Chelsea's Kepa Arrizabalaga now among the club's top targets. Madrid lost usual starter Thibaut Courtois to an ACL injury earlier this week, with the Belgian stopper set to spend the majority of the coming campaign on the sidelines as a result. Sevilla's Yassine Bounou was initially targeted as a replacement after an asking price of    20m ( £17.3m) was quoted, but sources have confirmed to 90min that Sevilla are now demanding upwards of    30m (25.9m) and Madrid are prepared to walk away as a result. Club officials have drawn up a long list of potential targets, including former Manchester United star David de Gea, but further contact has been made with Kepa as Madrid seek to explore all their options. Kepa has been targeted by Bayern Munich this week as the German side seek to replace their own injured goalkeeper, Manuel Neuer, but Madrid are now exploring a rival bid for the Chelsea man. feed Chelsea have already been active in the goalkeeper market this summer, selling Edouard Mendy to Al Ahli and replacing him with Robert Sanchez of Brighton, but the interest in Kepa has seen them reignite their search for a new stopper. Long-term target Giorgi Mamardashvili of Valencia remains on Chelsea's wish list, while the Blues are also known to have considered their own move for De Gea, who is available as a free agent following his departure from United. Porto's Diogo Costa has plenty of admirers at Stamford Bridge but is understood to be too expensive for the Blues, who are locked in talks over a double deal for Brighton's Moises Caicedo and Southampton's Romeo Lavia that could cost in excess of  £160m. Madrid are relaxed about their quest for a new stopper, believing there are plenty of options available to them. Leeds United's Illan Meslier has also been added to the shortlist as the Spanish side continue their search. Publicly, manager Carlo Ancelotti has put his faith in usual deputy Andriy Lunin, who is expected to start in goal for Madrid against Athletic Club on Saturday, but a move for a new goalkeeper is expected to be made soon enough.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Real Madrid have suffered a devastating blow on the eve of the new La Liga season, losing their goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois to an anterior cruciate ligament injury. The Belgian colossus has been pivotal to Madrid's success in recent years and Carlo Ancelotti hasn't had to think twice about who to start between the sticks. Courtois has been one of the world's leading shot-stoppers and his absence will be sorely felt by the Spanish side next season. Ancelotti needs a replacement for his number one, and has looked towards his old club Chelsea for a solution. Madrid have expressed their interest in taking Blues goalkeeper Kepa on loan for next season, a deal which Chelsea may be willing to sanction given their recent acquisition of Robert Sanchez. Here's why Real Madrid want Kepa at the Bernabeu. Considering Real Madrid will be relying on Andriy Lunin in their season opener against Athletic Club, Kepa's experience and quality would be a welcome addition to Los Blancos' squad. The Spanish stopper managed 39 appearances after reclaiming his starting spot from Edouard Mendy at Chelsea last year, including two encounters with Real Madrid in the Champions League quarter-finals. Kepa performed admirably given the criticism he has received in previous seasons, establishing himself as the club's guaranteed number one. Kepa ranked in the top 24% of Premier League goalkeepers for saves (3.16), save percentage (73.3%) and goals against (1.16) per 90 last campaign. He also boasted a +0.18 rate when it came to post-shot expected goals  minus goals conceded, suggesting that Kepa was performing significantly above average in terms of his shot-stopping. His ability and competence outside of his own penalty area could also be crucial for Madrid. He ranked in the top 17% of Premier League goalkeepers for number of defensive actions per 90 outside of his box (1.82), showcasing his quality in sweeping up opposition balls over the top. While not as significant in an Ancelotti team, it will still allow Madrid to press higher up the pitch, knowing Kepa can sniff out danger when direct balls are played in behind the defence.  Overall, Kepa provides Madrid with a cost-effective and experienced option. Add this to the fact that he is Spanish and knows La Liga intimately, and it seems like something of a no-brainer for Madrid, especially if they are only exploring a loan deal. Club Appearances Saves Save percentage Clean sheets Chelsea 162 379 69.4% 57 Athletic Club 54 134 67.7% 15 Real Valladolid 40 161 77.8% 12 Ponferradina 19 51 72.9% 8 *All stats courtesy of FBref feed Despite having initially prioritised a move for Sevilla goalkeeper Yassine Bounou, the asking price for the Moroccan appears to be a stumbling block stopping the deal from progressing. Attention has therefore turned to Kepa, who has also interested Bayern Munich, but Real Madrid don't want to rush into making a signing given the multitude of options potentially available to them. Kepa, however, is under serious consideration, with Courtois set for a long spell on the sidelines. At present, Madrid are said to only be interested in loaning the 28-year-old from Chelsea, although such a deal could have an option to buy or mandatory buy clause inserted into it. Given Chelsea's expensive pursuit of Moises Caicedo and Romeo Lavia, a permanent deal that could recoup some transfer funds may be preferential.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Kepa Arrizabalaga has confirmed he hopes to seal a permanent move to Real Madrid after joining the Spanish side on an initial loan from Chelsea. After Thibaut Courtois went down with a serious knee injury, Madrid began searching for a new goalkeeper and eventually settled on Kepa, who joined on Monday in a loan deal which does not include the option for Madrid to make the move permanent. Even though there is no purchase clause in Kepa\\'s loan contract, the 28-year-old made it clear he is looking to stay in Madrid for the foreseeable future. \"I really hope Real Madrid will keep me at the end of the season,\" he told a press conference when asked if he wants to stay at Madrid. \"Today is the first day of my assignment. We have time, we\\'ll see.  \"Hopefully with my performance I can make that happen.\" feed Madrid president Florentino Perez was eager to welcome Kepa, who he described as \"one of the best goalkeepers in the world.\" \"Dear Kepa, welcome to your new home. We know very well what it means to you at this moment and how hard you have worked to be able to defend the jersey and the crest of Real Madrid,\" Perez said. \"We\\'re delighted to have you on board because you\\'re one of the best goalkeepers in the world and we want to continue building on one of the most successful cycles in our history. \"You\\'re also one of the great Spanish goalkeepers. This may be one of the most important moments of your whole professional career and, we hope, of your life. Your hard work, your talent, your commitment, the tireless support of your family and, of course, the will to be a member of the best club in the world have brought you this far. \"You will now experience the emotion of playing at the Santiago Bernabeu stadium, where you will understand its magic and where you will feel the passion from Real Madrid fans, surrounded by a unique fan base that gives their all for Real Madrid. Don\\'t have any doubts, our fans will support you in taking on this challenge that is part of your biggest dreams. Dear Kepa, there are only a few who can experience the emotions that you are about to experience. This new period begins here with this crest full of trophies and unrenounceable values.\"',\n",

       "  'text': 'Liverpool are ready to match Chelsea   s offer for Southampton midfielder Romeo Lavia, 90min understands, with the transfer battle between the Premier League giants continuing. The two clubs have already been at war over Brighton & Hove Albion   s Moises Caicedo in recent days. Chelsea have been pursuing the Ecuador international for months, but it was Liverpool who first agreed a deal with Brighton for a British record fee of  £111m on Friday. Even then, it remained Caicedo   s preference to join Chelsea and the Blues, who had not previously offered more than  £80m, refused to throw in the towel. As it stands, Chelsea are now confident of finalising an agreement with Brighton in excess of the Liverpool offer already accepted. But Caicedo wasn   t the only player that Chelsea looked set to beat Jurgen Klopp   s team to. feed Liverpool, in need of midfielders after letting Jordan Henderson, Fabinho, Naby Keita, James Milner and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain all leave this summer, had earlier seen three bids for Lavia rejected by Southampton     they had been holding out for  £50m, with Liverpool   s best offer totalling  £45m. Suddenly, Chelsea came on the scene and submitted a  £48m bid for Lavia before raising that offer to  £55m - a fee which left the Blues confident of getting a deal done. 90min now understands that Liverpool are ready to make a fourth Lavia offer that matches Chelsea   s bid for the 19-year-old Belgian, who has played only 36 senior club games in his career. As far as Southampton are concerned, they are happy with the developments and keen to see how this bidding war between Chelsea and Liverpool plays out. Lavia, meanwhile, is yet to make known his preference one way or the other, having held positive talks with both clubs.',\n",

Just hours after their Premier League opener with Liverpool at Stamford Bridge, which ended 1-1, Chelsea reached an agreement with Brighton over their top summer transfer target.

The news of the agreement brings to an a frantic few days which has seen Chelsea beat Premier League rivals Liverpool to Caicedo's signature. Chelsea had been pursuing Caicedo all summer but up until last week refused to make a bid of over  £80m, with Brighton demanding at least  £100m for the South American midfielder, until Liverpool suddenly made an offer on Thursday evening and agreed terms on a deal worth  £111m. feed With Caicedo due for a medical on Merseyside on Friday, Liverpool looked to have beaten their top-flight rivals to his signature, but it then emerged that the 21-year-old had informed Brighton of his unwillingness to finalise a move to Anfield as he preferred to join Chelsea. Although Liverpool's offer remained on the table, Chelsea began talks and soon became confident of finally bringing Caicedo to Stamford Bridge. Now Chelsea have agreed a deal worth  £115m which will see them break the British transfer record once again. The Blues paid  £106m for Enzo Fernandez in January but are set to exceed that figure for Caicedo. Brighton will receive  £100m in guaranteed money from Chelsea with a further  £15m in add-ons, while the Seagulls will also retain a sell-on clause. Meanwhile, 90min understands that Chelsea believe they are well placed to finalise a deal to bring Southampton's Romeo Lavia to the club. Both Chelsea and again Liverpool have agreed fees with the Saints worth around  £55m for the Belgian international midfielder.\",\n",

But I think every manager you could ask would also want more. But it is about the mentality; in top football we are talking about the demand, the absolute maximum. Because we demand that from our players and, in their defence, they expect it from us,\" he said. \"We are looking for the perfect situation but you never get the perfect situation. Then you have to come into your place and work for that, maybe with not the perfect situation but the perfect results.\" With Maguire set to leave,  Ten Hag may get his wish as 90min  recently reported that Man Utd are set to enter the transfer market in search of some centre-back cover. Jean Clair-Todibo, Perr Schuurs, Jarrad Branthwaite and Edmond Tapsoba have all been linked, while the club are also in talks with Bayern Munich over Benjamin Pavard too.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Chelsea have announced the British record transfer of Moises Caicedo from Brighton, moving for  £115m and surpassing the  £106.8m spent on Enzo Fernandez in January. Caicedo has signed an eight-year contract at Stamford Bridge until 2031. \"I am so happy to join Chelsea!\" the 21-year-old said. \"I am so excited to be here at this big club and I didn   t have to think twice when Chelsea called me, I just knew I wanted to sign for the club. It   s a dream come true to be here and I can   t wait to get started with the team.\" It   s only ever been Chelsea. pic.twitter.com/LCYf6A2BQr Co-sporting directors Laurence Stewart and Paul Winstanley said: \"Moises has proved himself as a standout player in European football over the past 18 months, and we are thrilled to add him toMauricio Pochettino   s squad. \"Moises possesses a rare midfield skill set and is a player we   ve been targeting for some time. We believe he will make a significant impact at Stamford Bridge this season     and in the years ahead.\" Caicedo only joined Brighton in 2021 for as little as  £4m and spent part of his first year with the club on loan at Beerschot in Belgium. But his rise to becoming one of the best midfielders in the Premier League has been rapid, going from little known prospect to the most expensive player in British football history in the space of just one year. Chelsea have been interested in Caicedo for many months, but until recently their best offer for the Ecuador international was a maximum of  £80m. Liverpool then looked to have won the race with a  £111m offer, before Chelsea came back to the table.',\n",

       "  'text': 'From Stamford Bridge - The stage was set perfectly. Chelsea and Liverpool had been going at it hammer and tongs in the transfer market in the week leading up to their Premier League fixture at Stamford Bridge on Sunday afternoon. Moises Caicedo was, and remains, the object of their desires. The Brighton midfielder will become the most expensive player in Premier League history when he does eventually transfer, at some point in the coming week, you\\'d expect, with Liverpool initially having an offer accepted of  £111m for the Ecuadorian.  Caicedo has made his decision known that he\\'d prefer the move to west London, triggering public embarrassment for Liverpool - a club usually so efficient and proficient with their dealings to buy and sell first team players.  feed Having won the transfer pending an agreement with Brighton, which will be in the region of a quite ridiculous  £115m, Chelsea had hoped to present the player to their home support with a deal completed in the days leading up to their 1-1 draw on Sunday. One for the social media channels to rack up the engagements on, y\\'know, but it wasn\\'t to be. Caicedo wasn\\'t there, but good grief did both teams want him to be, with the need for a dominating defensive midfielder desperately obvious for both throughout a frantic, chaotic 101 minutes of opening weekend action. But what did Sunday\\'s game tell us about which team more desperately needs to break the British transfer record to sign a player with only 53 appearances in English football to his name? Liverpool might need a defensive midfielder, will try to confirm as and when pic.twitter.com/gg4CVUB0wd At least new Chelsea boss Mauricio Pochettino settled for pragmatism (in look and feel at least) as he attempted to cover the lack of defensive presence in midfield by naming a back three. Axel Disasi was named for a competitive debut alongside returning loanee Levi Colwill, with Thiago Silva relied upon in the middle. It suggested at least he was looking to stem the tide and not give too much away - though insisted post-match that his team played with four at the back. For Jurgen Klopp, it was back to gung-ho and heavy metal. You\\'d suppose you can\\'t name a six in your team if you don\\'t possess one, but Klopp went down the route of \"screw it\" with his team sheet, naming new signings Dominik Szoboszlai and Alexis Mac Allister alongside Cody Gakpo in the most attacking of midfield units.  Mac Allister was tasked with being the deepest midfielder, operating with Trent Alexander-Arnold drifting in from the right full back slot. Who needs Moises Caicedo more? Liverpool, because I\\'m not changing my system Caicedo is largely praised for his ability to cover ground, shuttling across to cover spaces left behind his teammates with the licence to attack. Fair to say both teams could have really utilised him here - first half especially - and that whichever team gets him will have a gem for next decade in a dream scenario. The opening 45 was a story of Pure, Unadulterated Barclays: Chaos Edition, with both teams\\' defences breached. Liverpool fired a warning after 12 minutes when Mohamed Salah struck the bar, but hit the front before the 20th minute after some excellent work from the Egyptian. Chelsea left far too much space for Salah to take possession and far too much space behind their back line for Luis Diaz to tap in at the far post. Plenty at fault but good defensive midfielders stop breakaways at source. There\\'d have been little Caicedo could\\'ve done about the way Chelsea\\'s equaliser came about - this was a story of space behind the back line and defenders switching off - but both teams had the ball in the net on a further occasion each only to see efforts ruled out for offside. In the second half, Conor Gallagher far better embraced the role he\\'d been given for the day as a midfield screen, while 90min POTM Enzo Fernandez grew in stature throughout with an imperious performance in possession. It meant the hosts shaded the second half, controlled the lions\\' share of possession and the chaos of the game had subsided...barring a frantic final few minutes. Who needs Moises Caicedo more?  Draw, because Conor Gallagher can\\'t play like he did in the second half every week and Liverpool do not own a senior defensive midfielder WhoScored have Chelsea\\'s pass completion at 88% compared to the visitors\\' 80%, but that could have something to do with Liverpool\\'s direct style on the day and push to get the ball forward. There were spells throughout the first half and before Chelsea found their feet where Liverpool were cutting the hosts open with direct passes through the middle and through the channels, but over the course of the game Chelsea stomped it out. The Blues themselves found moments to penetrate with vertical passes through the middle and often threatened with charges up the pitch from players in possession - they could have won the match late on following a break in that manner. You\\'d have to chalk Chelsea\\'s name on the board for better use of the ball today on the whole; namely because Enzo Fernandez is very good at football. But both teams have holes to fill. Who needs Moises Caicedo more? Liverpool, because they don\\'t have a six and won\\'t change their system During his time at Brighton, Caicedo was often seen covering in the absence of others at right back - and players nowadays - especially those who cost north of  £100m - are hugely valued for versatility. Chelsea won\\'t need that kind of cover given their options at right-sided centre back and with Malo Gusto joining the party over the summer and with Reece James named as club captain. Chelsea do need options and numbers in midfield but Caicedo\\'s name is a dream scenario and the completion of a midfield unit. Liverpool, meanwhile, only have 18-year-old Stefan Bajcetic as a natural presence in defensive midfield - and nobody else following the sales of Fabinho and Jordan Henderson, while they rely on Ibrahima Konate to cover three or four positions when Alexander-Arnold steps into midfield and Liverpool don\\'t have the ball. The Reds are in desperate need of a defensive presence in the centre and it would add levels to their game very quickly if they found the right fit. Who needs Moises Caicedo more? Liverpool Based on the evidence of today - from Jurgen Klopp\\'s decision to play Alexis Mac Allister at six while he wore 10 on his back, from Mauricio Pochettino\\'s decision to use a 3-5-2, from the second half performances of Conor Gallagher and Enzo Fernandez and from the apparent ease for opposing teams to progress through Liverpool\\'s centre, you\\'d have to say it\\'s Liverpool. Their bid has been accepted by Brighton but advances have been halted by the player, with Chelsea now primed to step in and complete the transfer in the week to come. They may even sign up Southampton\\'s Romeo Lavia to really take the biscuit - though Klopp\\'s team are to fight to the end on that one too with no decision from the player yet. If Chelsea do manage to secure their top target for the summer, they\\'ll have a midfield unit of Caicedo and Enzo which will be the envy of the Premier League for seasons to come. It\\'ll have cost in the region of  £220m for the two, but if you\\'re going for best in class, you\\'ve got to spend. Who needs Moises Caicedo more? Liverpool, but they\\'re not getting him are they?',\n",

       "  'text': 'Erik ten Hag has told Harry Maguire to leave Manchester United if he is not willing to fight for his place in the starting lineup. Maguire fell out of favour under Ten Hag during his first season in charge, making just eight Premier League starts under the new manager. Last month, the defender was stripped of the club captaincy, with the armband being given to Bruno Fernandes ahead of the new campaign. All of this has notably led to a huge amount of speculation around the player\\'s long-term future at Old Trafford, and with West Ham having seen a bid of  £30m now accepted by the Red Devils it looks as though Maguire is set to leave the club. 90min understands that although Maguire hasn\\'t been fully convinced of leaving Man Utd this summer, he is open to a move to West Ham and is likely to accept their contract offer.  Speaking about defender\\'s Man Utd future and seemingly impending transfer to the Hammers, Ten Hag told the press ahead of the club\\'s Premier League season-opener against Wolves that, if Maguire isn\\'t willing to fight for his place in the team, then he should leave. \"For Harry, he has to fight for his place. He has the ability to be a top-class centre-back, he is the best for England so why shouldn\\'t he be the best for us?\" Ten Hag said. \"But he has to prove it. When he is not confident enough to go with that fight then he has to go, he has to make the decision. But I am happy with him. feed \"We don\\'t have a squad with 11 players. Last year proved definitely we need all the players, so you need high level players who are maybe not starting but that can change, so there is an internal competition and everyone has to fight for his place. For many players that counts, when they are good they will get their games but no one can play all the games and finally, you find out what is the best team. \"In the squad now, all the positions are double and every player has the perspective to fight for his place. Then you have to show with your contribution it\\'s the best team performance. It is up to the players if they have the game time or less.\" In light of Maguire\\'s potential departure, 90min recently reported that Man Utd are set to enter the transfer market in search of some centre-back cover. Names that have been linked already include Jean Clair-Todibo, Perr Schuurs, Jarrad Branthwaite and Edmond Tapsoba. Man Utd are also in talks with Bayern Munich regarding versatile France defender Benjamin Pavard.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal have confirmed the signing of superstar forward Neymar from Paris Saint-Germain.  90min understands that the Saudi Arabian club have paid    90m ( £77.6m) for the 31-year-old\\'s services, brining an end to his six-year stay at PSG. The Ligue 1 club made Neymar the most expensive footballer in history back in 2017, signing the player for  £190m.  While the Brazilian won five Ligue 1 titles in Paris, he struggled with a number of muscle injuries throughout his time at the club, failing to make more than 22 league appearances in any of his six campaigns with the club.  Speaking to PSG\\'s official website, club chairman and CEO Nasser Al-Khelaifi said: \"It is inevitably difficult to say goodbye to a legend of the Club, which Neymar will be forever. I will never forget the day he arrived at Paris Saint-Germain, nor what he brought to our club and our project over the past six years. \"We have lived extraordinary moments and Neymar will always be part of our history. I would like to thank him and his family. We wish Neymar the best for the future and his next adventure.\"  manual Neymar has put pen to paper on a two-year deal in Saudi Arabia, and has picked the number 10 jersey to wear at Al Hilal.  Talks also remain on between PSG and Al Hilal over midfielder Marco Verratti, who could reunite with Neymar in the Middle East if the two clubs can agree on a fee. Al Hilal have been incredibly active in the transfer market so far this summer, bringing in Kalidou Koulibaly, Ruben Neves, Sergej Milinkovic-Savic and Malcom already.',\n",

Wilcox, who expects to see Lavia\\'s move sealed this week, offered fans at the BBC Solent Fans    Forum an insight into the complicated negotiations with both Liverpool and Chelsea. \"I think you know, it\\'s well known that we\\'ve had some significant interest in Romeo, we\\'ve had an offer which we accepted from Liverpool,\" Wilcox began. \"Then Chelsea came to the table.

Jurgen Klopp has already signed Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai but the surprise departures of Jordan Henderson and Fabinho have left the Reds short. Leeds United\\'s Tyler Adams is understood to be on Liverpool\\'s radar.

       "  'text': \"Chelsea are moving closer to a deal to sign Crystal Palace midfielder Michael Olise, 90min understands. Arsenal and Manchester City were both intrigued by news of a  £35m release clause in Olise's contract but, as 90min reported last month, Chelsea have long been confident they would win the race for his signature. Talks over personal terms have been ongoing for weeks and now sources have confirmed to 90min that Chelsea have taken a step forward in their negotiations with Palace as they seek to get an agreement over the line. Olise, who can play both in midfield and out on the wing, spent several years in the Chelsea academy before leaving aged 14, while his brother Richard, 18, is part of the Blues' Under-21 setup currently. feed Chelsea hope to finalise Olise's signing soon but are in no rush to do so as the 21-year-old is currently sidelined with a hamstring injury he picked up at this summer's Under-21 European Championships. Olise is not expected to return to the pitch until the end of September at the earliest so there is no imminent deadline to get the Frenchman registered for any upcoming fixtures, unlike midfielder Romeo Lavia, whose transfer from Southampton could be completed in time for the Belgian to face West Ham United on Sunday alongside fellow new arrival Moises Caicedo. 90min understands that Chelsea are expected to end their midfield rebuild once the moves for Lavia and Olise are finalised, with the Blues set to switch their attention to finding a goalkeeper to replace Kepa Arrizabalaga, who joined Real Madrid on loan and admitted during his presentation that he wants to stay in Spain beyond this season. A new striker is also a possibility for Chelsea, who lost Christopher Nkunku to a knee injury for the next four months.  Nicolas Jackson has impressed up top for Mauricio Pochettino's side, but Chelsea are otherwise short in attack as 21-year-old Armando Broja is still pushing to return from an ACL injury. Academy striker Mason Burstow was on the bench for the season-opener against Liverpool.\",\n",

The Brazil superstar will bring to an end his six-year stay in the French capital after agreeing terms on a two-year contract with the Saudi Pro League side. During his time with PSG, he averaged just 19 Ligue 1 matches per season and was continually criticised for his injury record and lifestyle away from the pitch.

He previously took the number 11 at Santos and Barcelona.  Sources have also told 90min that Al Hilal have not given up hope of signing Aleksandar Mitrovic. They reached an agreement with the Serbia international over personal terms earlier this summer, but despite indicating a willingness to pay    58m ( £50m), Fulham were unwilling to sanction a sale.

       "  'text': 'Manchester United   s hopes of offloading fringe midfielder Donny van de Beek to Real Sociedad have taken a hit amid stalled talks, 90min understands. Van de Beek was a Ballon d   Or nominee in 2019 thanks to his starring role for Erik ten Hag   s Ajax team on their journey to getting within seconds of the Champions League final. But a cruel combination of difficulty adapting to more physical English football, injuries, poor form and a lack of confidence has seen the Dutchman struggle to make an impact at Old Trafford, even after being reunited with former boss and mentor Ten Hag last season. As 90min has reported, Van de Beek has been exploring his options to leave throughout the summer, with his agents in contact with a number of European clubs. That follow decisions from Ten Hag, who retains a healthy relationship, and the club to give him permission to move on. In addition to AC Milan, Inter and Roma, there was Premier League interest from Wolves, Nottingham Forest and Crystal Palace, plus from Celtic north of the Scottish border. feed An offer from Real Sociedad came in early August, with the Spanish club proposing a loan with option to buy ahead of their return to the Champions League this season. However, a problem has arisen. 90min understands that the two clubs have so far been unable to come to an agreement over the exact make up of the deal. Van de Beek himself remains particularly keen and so there is still an underlying expectation that it will happen, but there is now a threat of Real Sociedad potentially walking away altogether. United have already successfully offloaded Fred to Fenerbahce, raising  £13m in the process, and departures from the midfield are important to free up space on the wage bill as the club continues to target Fiorentina and Morocco star Sofyan Amrabat.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Bayern Munich have completed the long-awaited signing of Harry Kane from Tottenham Hotspur. The 30-year-old has signed a four-year contract with the Bundesliga giants, bringing the curtain down on a glittering Spurs career that saw him usurp Jimmy Greaves as the club\\'s all-time record goalscorer. Kane has been Bayern\\'s primary target this summer, as the Bavarians look to finally replace the guaranteed goals of Robert Lewandowski, and have finally got a deal over the line after months of negotiating with Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy. 90min understands that Bayern will pay    100m ( £86.4m) to Tottenham for Kane, but the deal could be worth more should potential add-ons be triggered. \"Bayern is one of the biggest clubs in the world, and I   ve always said that I want to compete and prove myself at the highest level during my career,\" Kane told Bayern\\'s media team after confirmation of the move. \"This club is defined by its winning mentality.\" Kane leaves the Premier League widely regarded as one of the greatest strikers of the modern era. A Spurs academy graduate quickly dubbed \\'one of our own\\', he broke into the first team towards the back end of the 2013/14 season, before scoring 21 Premier League goals and 31 in all competitions the following year. manual The club\\'s famous number 10 shirt was soon his, and Kane continued to deliver the goods for Tottenham in addition to becoming one of England\\'s best players. He won multiple Premier League Player of the Month awards (seven in total) and was named in the PFA Premier League Team of the Year five times. Kane also bagged the Premier League Golden Boot three times, though his career-best 30 goals during the 2017/18 season was not enough to earn him the gong ahead of Mohamed Salah. That goal haul was matched last season despite Tottenham\\'s struggles in the Premier League, and it was apparent that Kane, who came close to leaving the club a couple of years ago to join Manchester City, may need to leave in order to fulfil his trophy ambitions. With just a year left on his contract, Real Madrid and Manchester United were expected to pounce, but it\\'s Bayern Munich who have got a deal over the line after months of courting. Kane is believed to have been registered in time to play in Saturday\\'s night German Super Cup final against RB Leipzig - a game that could see Kane lift the first silverware of his club career less than 24 hours after arriving in Germany.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Bayern Munich have told Manchester United that they want a fee of    40m ( £34.5m) plus add-ons for Benjamin Pavard, 90min understands. The 27-year-old is keen to leave the Allianz Arena this summer in search of a new challenge having lifted numerous trophies since arriving in Bavaria from Stuttgart in 2019. United, meanwhile, are keen to sign a new centre-back as they attempt to offload Harry Maguire to West Ham United in a  £30m deal, with Pavard's name high up on an extensive list of potential transfer targets. 90min previously revealed that United had open talks with Bayern over a deal for Pavard, who can play at right-back and at centre-back, and were working towards a deal that valued the World Cup winner at    35m ( £30m). But sources have confirmed to 90min that Bayern have communicated to United that they're looking for    40m plus add-ons for Pavard, much to the chagrin of the 13-time Premier League winners. Pavard is said to be unimpressed with Bayern's change in stance, with personal terms agreed in principle over a move to Old Trafford, with United also surprised by the moving of the goalposts. feed Talks are ongoing between the two parties, with United in particular keen to find a resolution, but Bayern's inability to land Kyle Walker from Manchester City means the Bundesliga giants could change their stance entirely on a potential sale. Jean-Clair Todibo, Perr Schuurs, Jarrad Branthwaite, Edmond Tapsoba and Benfica   s Antonio Silva are other options being considered by United, as they bid to strengthen the depth of Erik ten Hag's squad, though they don't offer the same positional versatility that Pavard does. To add fuel to the rumour fire, Pavard liked an Instagram post from United's official Instagram account that celebrated Raphael Varane's winner against Wolves on Monday night - though the two are international teammates and are known to be close friends. United have signed Andre Onana, Mason Mount and Rasmus Hojlund for significant transfer fees this summer, also adding Jonny Evans to their squad on a short-term deal. There have also been a number of outgoing this summer, with David de Gea and Freed the most high-profile exits to date. Maguire may follow, providing he gives an imminent answer to West Ham over a move to London Stadium, and there's continued speculation over the future of midfielder Scott McTominay.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Tottenham Hotspur defender Eric Dier could leave the club before the end of the summer transfer window with a number of teams considering a move for him, sources have confirmed to 90min. Dier has less than one year left to run on his Spurs contract but an agreement over an extension has not been reached and is not believed to be close. 90min were first to report back in June that Tottenham would be open to selling Dier as he was not in the immediate plans of new head coach Ange Postecoglou. The 29-year-old was left out of Spurs' matchday squad for their Premier League opening day draw at Brentford on Sunday, with Postecoglou revealing this was a tactical decision as Dier was fully fit. He was also omitted from the Greek-Australian's new-look leadership group despite playing a prevalent role under previous managers. With new vice-captain Cristian Romero, summer signing Micky van de Ven, Davinson Sanchez and Ben Davies all ahead of Dier in the pecking order, he could leave before the window closes, with Tottenham looking to trim their bloated squad ahead of the deadline on 1 September. Dier, who grew up in Portugal from the age of seven, admitted last year that he would like to play abroad again, and 90min understands he could get his wish. Former side Sporting CP would contemplate a reunion if they were to sell in-demand defender Goncalo Inacio in the next few weeks, while Lisbon rivals Benfica are also monitoring Dier in case their own highly-rated centre-back Antonio Silva leaves. However, it is likely that both clubs will keep hold of their homegrown stars for the time being. feed Ligue 1 side Monaco, who have been linked with Fulham defender and Tottenham target Tosin Adarabioyo, have asked Tottenham about the availability of Dier, as have a number of Bundesliga teams. Closer to home, London neighbours Crystal Palace and Scottish champions Celtic are believed to be admirers of Dier. There is also pressing interest in Dier from Saudi Pro League side Al Nassr, who already have the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Sadio Mane on their books. Unlike Dier's other suitors, they would be able to pay Spurs a more generous transfer fee, with European clubs looking for a cut-price deal. Dier joined Tottenham from Sporting back in 2014 and was one of their first signings under Mauricio Pochettino. He spent much of his debut season playing at right-back or centre-back before being moved into midfield under the Argentine. Since Spurs hired Jose Mourinho in 2019, Dier has almost exclusively played in his preferred centre-back role. He's played 361 games in all competitions for the Lilywhites.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Arsenal have completed the signing of goalkeeper David Raya on a season-long loan from Brentford. The Gunners allowed previous deputy Matt Turner to join Nottingham Forest earlier this month and have now replaced him with the in-demand Raya. A small loan fee has been paid and 90min understands Arsenal also have the option to buy Raya permanently for a total package of  £30m. Sporting director Edu told the club\\'s official website: \"We welcome David to us on a season-long loan from Brentford.  \"David is a top-quality goalkeeper, who has consistently performed to a high level with Brentford in the Premier League. With David joining us we are adding quality and depth to our squad so we can perform at the highest possible level in all competitions.\" Raya, who has been handed the number 22 shirt last worn by Pablo Mari during the 2021/22 campaign, signed a new two-year contract with Brentford before making the move, with the Bees also holding the option to extend that by a further 12 months. feed Raya, who was also wanted by Bayern Munich and had interest from a number of other top Premier League sides, will now compete with current number one Aaron Ramsdale for a spot in Mikel Arteta\\'s lineup. \"Bring it on,\" Ramsdale told ITV of the competition before Raya\\'s move was finalised. \"Nothing comes easy in football.  \"But also at the same time you need to move along and adapt as well.

So, yeah, I think if it happens, it happens and then we\\'ll fight and we\\'ll make each other the best version of ourselves because that\\'s what the manager is telling us as well. \"I\\'m sure whoever plays, me, Matt, whoever comes in, the goalkeeping union, people will laugh at but it\\'s a real thing, and your individual disappointment will go away and you\\'ll put the team first and you\\'ll put that goalkeeper first as well.\"',\n",

Barcelona president Joan Laporta is understood to be keen on a reunion with Neymar but manager Xavi has publicly claimed that the Brazilian is not part of the club\\'s transfer plans. However, that hasn\\'t stopped Roberto from reaching out to Neymar about a possible return to the club this summer. \"I\\'m excited because, at the end of the day, he\\'s an ex-teammate who is a friend and with whom I have experienced many good things over many years,\" Roberto told SPORT. \"When he was in the team, they were some of the best years I\\'ve had at Barca, we won everything. \"He\\'s a very different player from the others, I\\'m sure he would contribute a lot to us, but I\\'m not the one who decides.

       "  'text': 'As the years go by, more and more money is being spent by clubs in the transfer market. Lucrative broadcasting rights, commercial deals and other premium sponsorship means clubs are richer than ever, particularly if they have happen to being playing in the Premier League. The biggest transfers seen in world football may have happened around continental Europe, sure, but the level of spending in England, and regularity of it, is at an all-time high. And with Moises Caicedo\\'s  £115m move from Brighton to Chelsea now complete, the British transfer record has been smashed a whopping 19 times since the Premier League\\'s inception in 1992. Here\\'s every player and move to hold that accolade... Alan Shearer had only scored 23 goals in 118 appearances for Southampton by the time he left for Blackburn Rovers in 1992 - an average a goal just over every five games. But the soon-to-be Premier League winners, who had earned their place in the top flight via the second tier play-offs, knew exactly what they were getting with Shearer. A player who finish with both feet, bury headers for fun, and smash them in from close range and from long distance. Not even Blackburn could have imagined Shearer\\'s time at Ewood Park to go as well as it did, mind you. He scored 112 goals for the club four seasons - one of those was severely disrupted by injury - and scored over 30 in each of his final three, including lifting the title in 1995. One of Sir Alex Ferguson\\'s greatest pieces of work was nipping in ahead of Blackburn, who were being bankrolled by multi-millionaire Jack Walker, to sign Roy Keane for Manchester United. It was a genuine move from Ferguson as Keane spearheaded United\\'s domination of the Premier League for the next decade -  the Irishman establishing himself at the very top of the game in terms of performance level and leadership qualities. Seven Premier League crowns and five appearances in the PFA Premier League Team of the Year tells you all you need to know. Fresh from scoring 25 goals for Norwich City in the 1993/94 Premier League season, Chris Sutton was picked up by Blackburn for  £4m to partner Shearer up front. The transfer was an immediate success as the dynamic duo, flanked by Stuart Ripley and Jason Wilcox on the wings, scored goals for fun to steer Rovers to the title on the final day of the season. Sutton stayed at the club for further four years, bagging a career-best 18 league goals in Blackburn colours during the 1997/98 season. If you\\'re of a certain age, you\\'ll know the saying \\'Cole score goals\\'. Sir Alex Ferguson and Manchester United certainly knew it, which is why they decided to fork out  £7m to sign Cole from Newcastle United in January 1995, including send Keith Gillespie the other way. He scored 12 in 18 during his first half season in red and another 81 across the next six years. Multiple Premier League titles followed as a result, with Cole\\'s superb lob over Ian Walker to secure the 1998/99 crown one of his finer moments. Dennis Bergkamp arrived at Arsenal to huge fanfare in 1995 and it didn\\'t take the Dutchman long to drag the club out of the mid-table doldrums. Under the management of Arsene Wenger, Bergkamp helped transform the Gunners into genuine title contenders, forming a deadly partnership up front with Ian Wright while linking up with the brilliant Marc Overmars on the wing. Arsenal won the Premier League title in 1997/98, 2001/02 and 2003/04, with Bergkamp\\'s contributions earning him a statue outside the Emirates Stadium. \"Collymore closing in!\" is among the most iconic lines of commentary in Premier League history. It was uttered by Martin Tyler, former voice of Sky Sports, in the final moments of the iconic 4-3 thriller between Liverpool and Newcastle in April 1996. It also had a defining impact on that season\\'s title race, costing Newcastle in their fierce battle with Manchester United. Collymore\\'s rise had been rapid to the say the least. He had struggled to make an impact in the top flight as a teenager with Crystal Palace, before joining Nottingham Forest in the second tier afetr a spell at Southend. He then took his prolific lower league form into the Premier League and was poached by Liverpool for a British record fee after just one season (and 22 goals). Alan Shearer\\'s move to boyhood club Newcastle in 1996 wasn\\'t just a British record transfer, it was a world record too - the  £15m deal surpassed the  £13.2m that Barcelona paid to PSV Eindhoven for Brazilian prodigy Ronaldo only weeks earlier that same summer. Manchester United were also very keen on Shearer too, but were famously to the deal. Most thought it was Shearer\\'s desire to join his home town team, who had narrowly missed out on the 1995/96 Premier League title and played some of the best football in the country under Kevin Keegan. But then Manchester United chairman has claimed in more recent years there was more to it. \"Shearer had been to Alex Ferguson\\'s house, spoke to him and assured him he wanted to come [to Manchester],\" Edwards said on a podcast while promoting a book in 2019. \"The problem, I think, was with the chairman of Blackburn, Jack Walker, who was not a great fan of Manchester United...local rivals, both Lancashire clubs. He did not want Alan Shearer to come to Manchester United. Shearer was quite close to Walker, who was like a father figure to him, and I don\\'t think Alan wanted to upset him by coming to United. And I\\'m not sure Jack would have let him come anyway, whereas he was happy for Alan to go to Newcastle, I don\\'t think that was a threat to him.\" Shearer went on to score 206 goals in 10 years at Newcastle, breaking the club\\'s all-time record previously held for decades by Jackie Milburn. Leeds made Rio Ferdinand the world\\'s most expensive defender when they paid  £18m to West Ham in the final weeks of 2000. The club\\'s overspending would later lead to their financial demise, but the good times briefly rolled with Ferdinand dressed in all-white at the back. A few months after his arrival in west Yorkshire, the centre-back scored a famous goal in a Champions League quarter-final demolition of Deportivo La Coruna. His presence also coincided with a massive upturn in their domestic form, losing just two Premier League games in the second half of 2000/01 after a poor start to the campain. Manchester United had initially agreed to sign Ruud van Nistelrooy in 2000, only for the transfer to fall through over concerns about fitness. The Dutch stiker then suffered a dreaded ACL injury during a PSV Eindhoven training session, but United were still prepared to shell out a record fee in 2001. His goalscoring was immediate, netting twice on his Premier League debut and scoring 36 in all competitions on his first season, upping that number to 44 in his second. Van Nistelrooy finished his United career in 2006 with 150 goals in 219 games, an average of 30 per season, but is arguably an underrated part of the club\\'s modern history because of what the likes of Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo went on to achieve in the years that immediately followed. \"I used to get excited when the club would sign a big player because that   s the nature of the game. Veron came to the club, he was an excellent player, okay it didn   t work out for him at United, but he was an excellent player,\" Roy Keane said in 2020, looking back on Juan Sebastian\\'s two seasons at Manchester United. Veron signed for United having developed a lofty reputation thanks to his exploits in Serie A with Parma and Lazio. There was initial promise, that\\'s for sure, and the Argentine particularly enjoyed the European nights, but struggled to cope with the physical demands of an entire Premier League season without a fixed role in the team. Injuries compromised his second season at Old Trafford after a promising start to the campaign, and United opted to cut their losses and sell to Chelsea in 2003. Undeterred by Veron\\'s struggles, United broke the British record again the following summer, although Ferdinand\\'s familiarity with the English game perhaps rendered his  £29.3m arrival from Leeds substantially less of a risk.  Sir Alex Ferguson never doubted Rio\\'s capacity to become one of the world\\'s best in his position - his displays for England at the 2022 World Cup did that opinion no harm - and he rapidly developed into a stalwart of United\\'s defence. Frighteningly quick and unerringly cool in possession, Ferdinand was the ultimate modern-day centre-back. He enjoyed a stellar 12-year career at Old Trafford, lifting six Premier League trophies and the Champions League in 2008. He\\'s recognised as one of England\\'s greatest defenders and a modern Manchester United legend.  It took a little while for Ferdinand\\'s record to go, but smashed it was in the summer of 2006 as Chelsea prised former Ballon d\\'Or winner Andriy Shevchenko away from AC Milan.  The former Dynamo Kyiv hotshot emerged as one of the world\\'s most potent forwards during his time in Lombardy. Shevchenko departed Milan as their second leading scorer of all-time and with a Champions League medal in his back pocket, and the Ballon d\\'Or on his mantelpiece. However, the Ukrainian striker struggled to adjust to life in west London. His two years at Chelsea were rather forgettable. He scored here and there, and only rarely did he put together a sustained run of form. The striker\\'s apex was in the rearview mirror, that\\'s for sure, and he returned to Milan on loan for the 2008/09 season before eventually settling back in Kyiv. This signing ignited the revolution that culminated in Manchester City blossoming into the Premier League\\'s supreme force. On the same day City were bought out by the Abu Dhabi United Group, they quickly went to work and signed Brazilian star Robinho from Real Madrid for a British record  £32.5m. City had been haggling Reggina and Portsmouth for the additions of Rolando Bianchi and Benjani respectively in the preceding months, now they were negotiating with Europe\\'s elite. Money talks. Supposedly persuaded by City\\'s Brazilian contingent that included former Santos teammate Elano, Robinho signed up for the project in Manchester and made an immediate difference. His first season at the club was superb as he ended the 2008/09 as the Premier League\\'s fourth-highest goalscorer with 14. However, things quickly turned sour for the maverick attacker as injuries reduced his significance dramatically in year two. Discontent and perhaps fed up of listening to Mark Hughes, Robinho returned to Santos on loan in January 2010 and was never seen again in Manchester. Panic or sheer recruiting incompetence? Either way, Torres was never going to live up to his  £50m price tag at Stamford Bridge.  The Spaniard was no longer the phenom that took the Premier League by storm at Liverpool, with injuries reducing his explosiveness and rendering him a nondescript threat. Torres was forced to evolve and while the striker that rocked up at Chelsea was a shell of his peak-self, he remained somewhat useful. He was never prolific for the Blues during his three-and-a-half years at the club, but he did score one of the most memorable goals in Chelsea\\'s history away at Barcelona in the 2011/12 Champions League semi-finals. For that, many supporters overlooked his mammoth price tag. The ultimate maverick. A youthful but ambitious Pogba departed Manchester United for greater first-team opportunities overseas in 2012 and ended up at Juventus.  The Frenchman dazzled during his four years in Turin, swiftly evolving into the personification of a highlight reel and a bona fide superstar. Given his prestige, it was going to cost an arm and a leg for United to bring the midfielder \\'home\\'. But they did exactly that in 2016, handing Juve  £89m for his services. Now, summarising Pogba\\'s second stint at United is rather tricky. While the conclusion was somewhat sombre, the Frenchman did enjoy some scintillating runs of form at Old Trafford. However, it\\'s fair to say he couldn\\'t quite justify United\\'s massive outlay to bring him back, especially given that he eventually left for nothing (again) when he re-signed for Juve in 2022. Considering their riches, it\\'s pretty remarkable that City only appear on this list twice. Nevertheless, they made Grealish the first-ever Englishman to garner a  £100m fee in 2021.  The marvellous Brummie playmaker had put Aston Villa on his back during the 2019/20 season to keep the Villans in the Premier League, and a move away became increasingly inevitable after a fine 2020/21 campaign. City bit the bullet and acquired Grealish for a record fee after triggering his release clause, but it took the wide man a little while to find his feet at the Etihad. Adjusting to Pep Guardiola\\'s demands is never easy, and Grealish struggled to flourish in his debut season. But he excelled in year two and played an underrated role in City\\'s historic treble triumph. Overpriced, they said. Haha.  Convinced by his talent after an excellent 2022 World Cup with winners Argentina, Chelsea made a big splash in the January transfer window and signed Fernandez for a whopping  £106.8m. Despite his stellar form in Qatar during the winter, eyebrows were ubiquitously raised given the midfielder\\'s relative inexperience of European football.  He\\'d arrived at Benfica just six months prior.  Nevertheless, Fernandez stuck out for all the right reasons during his first few months in west London. He tried his utmost to ensure Chelsea looked competent, but not even he could salvage the Blues.  A controller, playmaker and potentially a final third producer all wrapped into one elegant midfield operator, Fernandez is set to take the Premier League by storm under Mauricio Pochettino at Stamford Bridge. Finding a suitable midfield partner for Fernandez was one of Chelsea\\'s key objectives in the 2023 summer transfer window, and they finally got their man.  Sure, it might\\'ve taken yet another British record fee to acquire their desired midfield target, but Moises Caicedo\\'s potential alongside Fernandez renders the outlay somewhat measured given the tandem\\'s projected dynamic.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Chelsea have triggered the release clause in the contract of Leeds United midfielder Tyler Adams, sources have confirmed to 90min. The Whites were relegated from the Premier League last season, activating a  £20m clause that allows Adams to leave Elland Road if a bidding club is prepared to pay in full. 90min revealed on Monday that Chelsea had contacted the representatives of Adams over a move to west London, and personal terms are now being discussed with the 24-year-old United States international. The Blues have also informed Leeds of their intention to pay Adams' release clause in full, and he is expected to undergo a medical within the next 24 hours. Adams is seen as a shrewd signing by those in charge at Stamford Bridge, who are working to provide manager Mauricio Pochettino with the midfield reinforcements he has publicly requested this summer. feed Chelsea are working on a number of midfield signings and recently launched a bid to rival Liverpool for Southampton midfielder Romeo Lavia, who has been on the Blues' radar for over 12 months now. After Liverpool saw a  £46m bid rejected for Lavia, Chelsea put forward an offer of  £48m, though that remains short of Southampton's  £50m asking price. Chelsea are also continuing to work on an agreement for Brighton midfielder Moises Caicedo, whose  £100m asking price has so far proven problematic. Liverpool have also made late contact with Brighton over potentially rivalling Chelsea's latest offer, which sat at  £80m, but have not progressed talks to the point of making a formal offer.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Barcelona vice-president Rafa Yuste has confirmed that Ousmane Dembele is on the verge of completing a move to Paris Saint-Germain. The France international was not expected to leave or push for a move away from Catalonia this summer, but PSG triggered his    50m ( £43m) release clause shortly before it expired in July and proceeded to discuss personal terms. During these negotiations, Dembele was called out in public by Barcelona head coach Xavi and club captain Sergi Roberto, who expressed their shock at the sudden move. 90min reported on August 3 that PSG had hoped to wrap up a deal before the end of last week, but a deal has dragged on and reports from the Spanish press suggested talks had stalled. feed But after Dembele was omitted from Barca\\'s squad to take on Tottenham Hotspur in the annual Joan Gamper Trophy on Tuesday night, vice-president Yuste insisted that the transfer will go ahead and confirmation of an agreement is close. \"We\\'re on the verge of resolving Dembele deal with Paris Saint-Germain as all parties want to seal it as soon as possible,\" Yuste said. \"Dembele is not with us tonight as we hope to settle the matter soon. We are on it.\" With money raised from the sales of Dembele and midfielder Franck Kessie, 90min understands that Barcelona will make a fresh move to sign Joao Cancelo, while they remain interested in his Manchester City teammate Bernardo Silva.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Manchester United goalkeeper Matej Kovar is on the verge of a permanent transfer away from the club as he undergoes a medical with Bayer Leverkusen, sources have confirmed to 90min. Now 23, Kovar has been with United since the age of 17. He joined from home-town club Solvacko in 2018 and has been loaned out to Swindon Town, Burton Albion and Sparta Prague during that time. It was his loan at Sparta last season that brought Kovar to wider attention. It was his very first year as a top flight starter and he helped the club win the Czech First League and return to the Champions League qualifying rounds. 90min reported in May that Kovar   s form on loan had caught the eye of his parent club. There were glowing reviews coming back from Prague and he was included in the thought process regarding the goalkeeping position long before Andre Onana was eventually signed. At a time when David de Gea was widely expected to sign a new contract at Old Trafford, United staff considered the possibility that Kovar could emerge as the Spaniard   s chief back-up and limit the need to spend big on a new goalkeeper. feed However, De Gea   s contract offer was later withdrawn and revised, ultimately leading to him leaving the club as a free agent. It accelerated the need for a readymade number one and so the club spent handsomely to sign Onana from Inter, reuniting the Cameroonian with Erik ten Hag. Kovar was briefly involved in United   s pre-season programme, playing 135 minutes of the opening two summer friendlies against Leeds and Lyon. But his immediate future now lies elsewhere. 90min understands that a  £7.8m (   9m) transfer fee has been agreed with Bayer Leverkusen and that a medical to complete the transfer is already being undertaken. Ties with Kovar have not been fully cut though, as United have retained a buy-back clause that could see him return to Manchester. Leverkusen finished sixth in the Bundesliga last season following a remarkable turnaround once Xabi Alonso was appointed head coach, having been flirting with relegation initially. It means that Kovar could have the chance to play Europa League football in 2023/24. He will compete with veteran Finland international and current Leverkusen captain Lukas Hradecky.',\n",

Bellingham was Liverpool\\'s top target heading into the summer transfer window but, when the true cost of the deal was set, the Reds ultimately pulled out and Bellingham ended up joining Real Madrid for an initial  £88.5m. Since then, however, Liverpool agreed to the surprise sales of both Jordan Henderson and Fabinho, who moved to Saudi Arabia, and Klopp admitted that unplanned income played a part in the  £111m move for Caicedo. \"I can confirm that the deal with the club is agreed,\" Klopp told a press conference when asked about the Caicedo bid. \"What did change? We are a club, we have not endless resources, we didn\\'t expect a couple of things happening in the summer - Hendo, Fab, stuff like this.

The Red Devils recently completed the signing of Atalanta\\'s Rasmus Hojlund for a fee that could reach  £72m. He is expected to become their starting striker once he returns to full fitness following a back injury, United have had a long-standing interest in Harry Kane, but they did not make any advances to Tottenham Hotspur this summer, and the 30-year-old is now set to join Bayern Munich after the two clubs agreed on an  £86.4m fee. Ahead of Monday\\'s Premier League opener at home to Wolves, Ten Hag was asked about Kane\\'s move to the Bundesliga and Man Utd\\'s own interest - with the Dutchman admitting his exit is a blow to England\\'s top flight. \"I don\\'t think that I have to go into that discussion or give an opinion about that,\" Ten Hag said. \"We are professional, the processes we do are really careful. \"We consider a lot of things but finally we make decisions, we don\\'t take decisions overnight, there is a strategy in every decision behind and we are happy with the squad we have behind us now. feed \"We have chosen a striker and we are really happy with our choice.

The Reds made two early splashes in the transfer market this summer by signing Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai for a combined  £95m, which could grow to  £115m with the former\\'s add-ons. Liverpool have largely struggled to get any other deals over the line however, seeing three bids rejected by Southampton for Romeo Lavia and interest in defensive options such as Jurrien Timber fizzle out - with the defender instead joining Arsenal.  Coupled with that, the Reds have also let a huge number of first-team players leave the club, particularly in midfielder as captain Jordan Henderson and vice-captain Fabinho both joined Saudi Pro League teams, and the likes of James Milner, Naby Keita and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain all left as free agents. Long-serving forward Roberto Firmino has also moved on. feed All of this has ultimately led to Liverpool fans being rather unimpressed with the club\\'s transfer business and new club captain Van Dijk admitted that he understands their concerns. \"I can definitely understand it in some ways but I\\'m not a very negative person,\" he said. \"Obviously, when a lot of players are leaving, when your captain and vice-captain is leaving, and at the moment, there are only two incomings. And the way we have been playing, in possession really good but defensively when you concede goals it\\'s not as good, I can understand some people having doubts. \"Let\\'s see if more players are coming in and then we have to be ready again for a long season. It will be very tough if we look at the teams around us, but we want to be up there again, we want to be challenging again.  \"We have to be confident, we should be confident, and we should still be learning each and every day. There have been characters leaving, players who have played a big part in the success, but others have to step up. That\\'s a nice challenge in my opinion.

       "  'text': 'Nice manager Francesco Farioli has confessed Manchester United\\'s interest in centre-back Jean-Clair Todibo could leave them powerless to keep the Frenchman. United are on the cusp of selling Harry Maguire to West Ham United for  £30m and have identified former Barcelona defender Todibo as a potential replacement for the Englishman. One of the top performers in Ligue 1 last season, Todibo is rated incredibly highly by everyone at Nice, including new manager Farioli, but while the boss wants to keep Todibo, he admitted he could not guarantee no business would be done. \"I also have two vice-captains Khephren Thuram and Jean-Clair Todibo who are among the best players in the team,\" Farioli told the media. \"We would like both players to stay until the end of the season, but you cannot escape the reality of the transfer window. We\\'ll see what happens. As long as they\\'re here, I\\'m enjoying having them.\" feed He continued: \"Of course we would like Todibo to stay, but it can be complicated. We have to wait to see who will want to buy him and if everyone finds an agreement there.  \"He is a leader, a very strong player mentally, he has improved a lot and he is ready to reach the very top level.\" United have drawn up a sizeable list of potential replacements for Maguire. Alongside Todibo, there is also interest in Torino\\'s Perr Schuurs and Everton\\'s Jarrad Branthwaite, while Bayer Leverkusen\\'s Edmond Tapsoba is seen as an expensive alternative. The Red Devils have also been offered the chance to sign versatile Bayern Munich defender Benjamin Pavard, who is in the final year of his contract and is expected to be available for a fee similar to the  £30m United are in line to receive for Maguire.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Arsenal will initially sign Brentford goalkeeper David Raya on a season-long loan with an option to then make the deal permanent in 2024, 90min understands. Raya has made it clear that he is ready to take the next step in his career, with Brentford repeatedly pointing suitors to a  £40m price tag. That figure put Tottenham and Bayern Munich off pursuing a deal, but Arsenal were able to come to a  £30m agreement earlier this week. It isn   t a straight transfer though. 90min understands that the agreement will actually see Raya sign a one-year extension to his Brentford contract so that it then expires in the summer of 2025 instead of at the end of this season     that could have seen him walk away as a free agent. He will then join Arsenal on loan for the duration of the 2023/24 season, rather than outright. At the end of the loan, the Gunners will have an option to make it permanent for the total  £30m already agreed. It is not, however, an obligation to buy. feed That gives Arsenal a get out option should Raya not succeed in establishing himself. In the same breath, should the Spaniard end up returning to Brentford, his value is protected by the contract extension and they would still have the opportunity to command a sizeable transfer fee. The proposed structure of the deal will financially benefit Arsenal, who have already splashed out more than  £200m in transfer fees this summer on Kai Havertz, Jurrien Timber and Declan Rice. Hailing from Barcelona, Raya has spent his entire senior career in English football, having moved from Catalan club Cornella to Blackburn   s academy at the age of 16 almost a decade ago.',\n",

Fred made 56 appearances for United last season, although he was primarily a back-up option and started only 12 times in the Premier League. The Brazilian has since also seen Mason Mount join the club, adding further competition for midfield places. It was the arrivals of both Christian Eriksen and Casemiro last summer that initially pushed him down the Old Trafford pecking order.

As 90min reported at the time, Galatasaray had an offer rejected in mid-July because it fell short of the  £20m asking price. Now, however, United have agreed to sell for less. The deal negotiated with Fenerbahce is worth  £13m (   15m), inclusive of add-ons. Fred also resisted the opportunity to move to the Saudi Pro League, which has already welcomed the likes of N   Golo Kante, Fabinho, Jordan Henderson and Ruben Neves from the Premier League this summer.',\n",

The Reds agreed to pay a British-record  £111m fee to the Seagulls during the early hours of Friday morning and had expected to wrap up a deal for the midfielder over the weekend. Liverpool were so confident that completion of Caicedo's move was imminent that manager Jurgen Klopp openly talked about negotiations during a press conference on Friday.

Chelsea have since abandoned their pursuit of Leeds United's Tyler Adams despite agreeing a  £20m fee.

The Hammers have been exploring how to spend the  £105m earned by Declan Rice\\'s sale to Arsenal and have begun their shopping spree with a move for Alvarez, who 90min understands will set West Ham back around  £34m if all add-ons are met. Alvarez, 25, has signed a five-year contract at London Stadium to become West Ham\\'s first addition of the summer. \"I am very happy and very proud to be here,\" Alvarez told club media. \"Being here in London and seeing London Stadium, it   s amazing.

To join a club like a West Ham is a dream for me and my family.  \"The Premier League is a special league, the best league in the world and I think my style will suit it. I now have a responsibility to West Ham and the West Ham family and I will give absolutely everything for the shirt.\" feed Manager David Moyes added: \"We   re really pleased to add Edson to our squad. The midfield area was one we were especially keen to strengthen this summer     and Edson will complement the other options we have in that department. \"He   s an experienced international player, who has enjoyed great success for both club and country during his career to date.\" \"We   re excited about welcoming to West Ham and seeing him play his part in English and European competition for the Club.\" West Ham\\'s spending may just be getting started after bids of  £30m for both Southampton\\'s James Ward-Prowse and Manchester United\\'s Harry Maguire were accepted.',\n",

Arribas joined Madrid from the youth system at city neighbours Leganes back in 2012 and gradually rose through the ranks at Valdebebas. The forward made his first-team debut in September 2020 and had played eight senior games by the end of that campaign, combining duties with Real Madrid Castilla.

With Real Madrid Castilla last season, Arribas scored 18 goals in 34 appearances. Madrid are yet to replace Karim Benzema and have also let Mariano Diaz leave, but 21-year-old Arribas won   t be used to plug the attacking holes in the squad. He has now signed a long-term contract with Almeria until the summer of 2029. In their first top flight campaign since 2015, Almeria narrowly avoided relegation last season.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Juventus\\' training match against Juventus Next Gen was interrupted on Wednesday by a pitch invasion which saw supporters protest a possible move for Chelsea striker Romelu Lukaku. The clubs have spoken this summer about a possible deal for Lukaku which would also see Dusan Vlahovic head to Stamford Bridge, but while Chelsea appreciate the Serbian striker, 90min understands they have a huge issue with Juve\\'s demand for an extra  £35m as part of the deal. These negotiations came after Lukaku\\'s proposed return to Inter collapsed when the Italian side learned of talks between Juventus and the Belgian, who had privately and publicly vowed never to play for any Serie A side other than Inter. As a result, Lukaku\\'s proposed move to the Allianz Stadium has not gone down well among fans, many of whom were heard screaming \"No, we don\\'t want Lukaku\" during Wednesday\\'s friendly - chants which initially began in the stands during the first minute of the game. It\\'s worth noting that this game between Juventus and Juventus Next Gen took the place of the annual Villar Perosa friendly, in which it is tradition for fans to invade the pitch. But while the event is usually full of positivity as fans get the chance to meet players, a large number of supporters chose to use the opportunity to oppose a move for Lukaku instead. Invasione (anche senza Villar Perosa) #Juve pic.twitter.com/zpGsQcm7Ko Sources have confirmed to 90min that Chelsea are no longer entertaining the idea of a swap deal between Lukaku and Vlahovic as they do not share Juventus\\' valuation of the latter, but the Blues are still open to a straight sale if the right bid arrives for Lukaku. Options for Lukaku, who rejected an approach from Saudi Arabia earlier this summer, are proving limited after Inter closed the door on a potential transfer. \"Given what Inter has done for him, we expected him to behave differently, as a professional and as a man,\" Inter vice-president Javier Zanetti told La Gazzetta dello Sport. \"He has the right to go where he wants, of course, but he could have told us that beforehand. Nobody is bigger than the club and when building a team, you always have to consider who you are bringing into the dressing room.\"',\n",

       "  'text': \"Kylian Mbappe has reiterated his desire to stay with Paris Saint-Germain and see out the remainder of his contract in the French capital, 90min understands. The 24-year-old shocked PSG earlier this summer when he told them he would not be exercising the option to extend his contract, which is set to expire in June next year. PSG have responded by trying to sell Mbappe this summer, in a desperate bid to avoid losing one of the world's best players on a free transfer, but he has made it clear on numerous occasions that he intends to leave next year as a free agent. The Ligue 1 giants even accepted a world record offer of  £257m (   300m) from Al Hilal last month, but despite putting forward a gargantuan contract offer to Mbappe, the PIF-backed Saudi Pro League side were unable to persuade the World Cup Golden Boot winner to enter negotiations. Chelsea have also been contracted by PSG in a bid to drum up further interest in Mbappe, as have a number of other heavyweight European clubs. Mbappe was left out of PSG's recent pre-season tour of Japan and has been banished from first-team duties as the dispute between player and club rages on - sources have told 90min that club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi has even warned Fayza Lamari, his mother and agent, that Mbappe will 'not put a PSG shirt on again.' manual Despite the hostile atmopshere, Mbappe's position on the matter remains unchanged. 90min understands that he intends to spend the next 12 months in Paris before moving on to his next venture, which many believe will be at Real Madrid, and he has informed PSG of his plan. Sources close to Mbappe and Real Madrid have vehemently denied that an agreement is already in place for him to move to the Spanish capital next summer, but he came within a whisker of joining Madrid in 2022 before a last-minute change of heart saw him sign a new contract at PSG. Mbappe's sidelining is part of a radical overhaul at PSG this summer. Lionel Messi has already departed for Inter Miami, while the Parisiens are also keen to ship out Neymar. He has interest in his services from Saudi Arabia, with a potential return to Barcelona also rumoured in recent weeks.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Barcelona are not concerned about losing midfielder Ilkay Gundogan over a registration clause in his contract, 90min understands. Gundogan joined on a free transfer from Manchester City this summer, inking a two-year contract which also includes an option for the midfielder to terminate his deal if he is not registered in Barcelona's squad by the time the new La Liga season kicks off this weekend. Financial restrictions mean Barcelona have not yet registered any of their new singings - Gundogan, Oriol Romeu, Inigo Martinez - as well as any new contracts agreed this summer and the return of loanees like Ez Abde and Fermin Lopez.  As it stands, manager Xavi has just 13 eligible players for the season-opener against Getafe on 13 August, including Ousmane Dembele and Franck Kessie, who are on the cusp of leaving the club. The imminent sales of Dembele and Kessie, to Paris Saint-Germain and Al Ahli respectively, are expected to net Barcelona around    65m ( £56m), while talks are also on over a 16% sale of Barca Studios which would provide another cash injection. feed Sources have confirmed to 90min that Barcelona are confident they will wrap up their outstanding deals in time to register Gundogan and the rest of their new signings before the new season gets underway. As was the case with Gavi earlier this summer when the midfielder's contract extension was delayed, Gundogan is not causing problems behind the scene and is not contemplating an early exit from Camp Nou. While Barcelona understand their current situation, sources close to the club insist they are confident they have the financial capacity to register all their new signings - a stance exemplified by ongoing efforts to sign Manchester City duo Bernardo Silva and Joao Cancelo. Gundogan and the rest of Barcelona's new signings can be registered up to and including the day of the Getafe game, and club officials are optimistic everything will be finalised in time.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Arsenal have rejected a  £30m bid from Ligue 1 side Monaco for Folarin Balogun, sources have confirmed to 90min. Balogun returned to the Gunners during the summer after a successful loan spell with Reims in which the forward managed a stunning 21 goals in Ligue 1 for the mid-table team. Despite expectations being high among Gunners fans upon his return to the Emirates, the striker barely featured during a pre-season riddled with injury concerns. Even without a dismal pre-season with Arsenal, Balogun has long been expected to leave the club once again this summer but this time permanently - the player himself stated in June that he \"definitely\" would not go out on loan again. The USMNT international has also consistently rejected the opportunity to enter talks over a new contract at the Emirates Stadium due to the lack of guarantees of game time.  90min reported in July that this resistance to signing a new deal, and unwillingness to go out on loan, has led to Arsenal slapping a  £50m price tag on the striker. feed Crystal Palace, West Ham United, Brentford, Fulham and UEFA Champions League finalists Inter have all been in contact regarding the player\\'s services, but sources have now confirmed to 90min that Monaco are the first to table an offer.  The Ligue 1 club have made an opening bid of  £30m which has been swiftly reject by the Gunners, who are holding firm on their  £50m price tag.  Monaco have stepped up their efforts to sign a new striker following Breel Embolo\\'s ACL injury during a pre-season game. The ailment will see the Swiss forward miss the bulk of the 2023/24 campaign, making the signing of a new starting calibre striker a priority for the principality club.  Along with Balogun, 90min understands that Gift Orban of Gent and reported Chelsea and West Ham target Elye Wahi have also been shortlisted by Monaco. Both forwards have recently held talks with representatives of Tottenham Hotspur.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Liverpool have agreed a British record deal worth  £111m to sign Brighton midfielder Moises Caicedo, 90min understands. The Reds opened talks with Brighton on Thursday as they pivoted from Southampton's Romeo Lavia to Caicedo and now terms are agreed between the two clubs. Caicedo had been Chelsea's prime midfield target all summer, but they baulked at the idea of meeting Brighton's value - which has always been at least  £100m - while Liverpool's offer of  £111m was immediately accepted. Such a deal would represent a British record, eclipsing the  £106m Chelsea paid to land Enzo Fernandez in January. Chelsea made numerous offers for Caicedo, but their highest did not exceed  £80m and now they have missed out on the Ecuador star who is destined for Anfield, where he will help form an overhauled midfield containing Hungarian star Dominik Szoboszlai and former Seagulls teammate Alexis Mac Allister. feed Caicedo is now due to head to Merseyside to complete his medical and is expected to sign his contract before this weekend's Premier League opener, which just so happens to come against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Sunday. For Liverpool, the deal is an obvious club record, eclipsing the  £75m paid to sign centre-back Virgil van Dijk from Southampton in January 2018. While such an expensive move was not initially on the cards this summer, Liverpool raised significant funds through the unplanned sales of Jordan Henderson and Fabinho to Saudi Arabia and ultimately decided to pull the trigger. As for Chelsea, the Blues joined the bidding for Liverpool target Lavia earlier this week as they submitted a  £48m offer for the Southampton midfielder, who has been valued at  £50m. Chelsea have also confirmed their intention to trigger the  £20m release clause of Leeds United midfielder Tyler Adams.\",\n",

The German champions have been looking to add another stopper to their ranks while Manuel Neuer continues his recovery from a broken leg that he suffered during a skiing trip back in December. They had previously looked at Brentford's David Raya, but like Tottenham Hotspur refused to match the  £40m valuation. The Bees have since agreed to sell him to Arsenal for  £30m.

De Gea also has suitors in the Saudi Pro League and it remains to be seen whether he would turn down such lucrative offers to join Bayern as a backup.

After David de Gea\\'s departure on a free transfer, United began looking for two new goalkeepers and were reported to have lined up 20-year-old Suzuki, then of Japanese side Urawa Red Diamonds, as a possible backup to new number one Andre Onana. Suzuki had other plans, however, taking his talents to Belgium and joining Sint-Truiden on loan with a view to a permanent transfer next summer. While Suzuki admitted he would love to play for United in future, he confessed that he did not want to sit on the bench behind  £47.2m signing Onana. feed \"I decided to transfer this time as a step up in aiming to be the best in the world. It\\'s true that there was an offer from Manchester United,\" Suzuki told the media. \"As a football player and as a person, if I hadn\\'t thought about anything, of course, I would like to go to Manchester United, but among them, I really want to spend time thinking about what kind of future awaits me. After much thought, I made this decision. \"Manchester United have acquired Onana. It\\'s important for me to participate in matches, and I think it is also important to play on the world stage. I want to make the most of what I have learned here and do my best.\" Despite his initial rejection, Suzuki confirmed he dreams of making the move to the Premier League and flying the flag for his country. \"While many players are active overseas, it is difficult to become a keeper,\" he concluded. \"I think we are going to have a really tough battle ahead of us in that position. \"There are still no Japanese who are active as goalkeepers in the Premier League, so I want to be one of the first players to do so.

Bayern Munich have had three bids for Kane knocked back by Spurs already this transfer window and are preparing a fourth worth  £94.6m (   110m). However, 90min understands that Tottenham have showed no indication that this will be enough to convince them to sell their star striker, who has less than a year left to run on his contract. 90min revealed on Tuesday that Kane would like his future sorted before the start of the new Premier League campaign - if he is still at Tottenham by the time they face Brentford on Sunday, he is happy to stay put for the entirety of 2023/24. Tottenham remain hopeful they can convince Kane to commit his long-term future to the club and he has been impressed by new head coach Ange Postecoglou following his appointment in June. Though Spurs are adamant that Kane will not be allowed to leave, they have brought in a new centre forward in Argentina youth international Alejo Veliz this week and could yet sign another this summer. feed Sources have told 90min that representatives of Spurs have sounded out several other strikers regarding potential moves to north London. 21-year-old Gent forward Gift Orban, who has scored a staggering 22 goals in 24 games since joining the Belgian club last year, is one target that Tottenham have spoken to. Chelsea target Elye Wahi of Montpellier and Lille star Jonathan David are also on Spurs' radar, as is wantaway Fulham talisman Aleksandar Mitrovic, who saw a proposed move to Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal fall through earlier this summer. Mitrovic was keen on a move to Saudi Arabia but Al Hilal failed to stump up more than  £30m, with Fulham demanding closer to  £50m for the Serbia international. Beyond Kane and Veliz, Brazil's starting number nine Richarlison is also on Tottenham's books and has enjoyed a fruitful pre-season under Postecoglou.\",\n",

As a young man, that interest is inevitably going to have an impact on your thought process and unsettle you a little bit. We understand that. \"But for now, he\\'s a Brighton player, he\\'s under contract. We expect him to work hard, prepare for the new season and we\\'ll see what happens as the window goes on. \"The window\\'s got a long way to go, we\\'d love to keep him. He\\'s a really important player, we\\'ll see where we are.\" Brighton lost Leandro Trossard to Arsenal in January and have also sold Alexis Mac Allister and Robert Sanchez to Liverpool and Chelsea this window respectively. However, they have responded with incoming deals for Joao Pedro, Mahmoud Dahoud, James Milner, Bart Verbruggen and Igor Julio. A club-record  £34.5m deal has also been agreed with Ajax for Ghana forward Mohammed Kudus, though an agreement over personal terms still hasn\\'t been reached.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Barcelona manager Xavi has responded to rumours linking Neymar with a sensational return to Catalonia this summer.  The Brazilian superstar has been heavily linked with a move away from current club Paris Saint-Germain, with 90min recently revealing that the Ligue 1 giants are working hard to try and move the forward on.  Signed for a world record fee of  £190m (   222m) back in 2017, Neymar has largely disappointed during his time in Ligue 1 due to a myriad of injury concerns. The 31-year-old has never played more than 22 league games in any given season during his six year spell in Paris, and has failed to win the club their first ever UEFA Champions League - being on the losing end in the 2020 final.  Neymar enjoyed a much more successful stint at Barca between 2013 and 2017, winning the Champions League and two La Liga titles as an integral member of the famed \\'MSN\\' frontline.  In light of PSG\\'s interest in selling the player, Neymar has inevitably been linked with a return to his former club Barcelona. 90min understands that club president Joan Laporta is keen to re-sign Neymar, however manager Xavi would prefer if the club targeted Manchester City star Bernardo Silva.  feed Speaking to the press after Barcelona\\'s 4-2 win over Tottenham Hotspur in the Joan Gamper Trophy on Tuesday evening, Xavi was asked about the links with Neymar, saying: \"I cannot say anything more about Neymar. Last year I had mentioned a name of a player from another team and that club got angry. From here until the end of the market, we will see.\" Xavi also commented on the need for Barca to bulk their squad further this summer, telling reporters: \"We have to strengthen ourselves well. The sports area and the president know this reality. I\\'m happy with how our players are training and our pre-season.\" Barcelona are likely to face stiff competition from PIF owned Saudi Pro League clubs and potentially Newcastle United, depending on the future direction the club\\'s owners in regards to transfer policy.',\n",

The Blues are looking to bring in a couple of midfielders this month to bolster Mauricio Pochettino's options and Lavia has emerged as one of their prime targets. Chelsea are already in talks with Brighton & Hove Albion over Moises Caicedo and have seen a number of bids for him rejected, but 90min understands that, while those talks are continuing, they have now also made a move for Lavia. Chelsea have long been interested in Lavia, with their interest driven by their co-director of recruitment and talent Joe Shields - the man who took Lavia to Southampton in 2023. feed Southampton, who have agreed to sell their captain James Ward-Prowse to West Ham Untied for  £30m, are demanding  £50m for Belgian starlet Lavia and Chelsea's offer is short of that at  £48m, but it is the largest bid they have received so far this summer. Liverpool have been in pole position for Lavia, but they have seen three bids for the teenager rejected, with their latest offer for the 19-year-old being worth  £45m. Sources believe that Southampton are now more than confident that their  £50m asking price will be met by one of Lavia's suitors and they won't be accepting less.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Real Madrid are preparing to move for Sevilla goalkeeper Yassine Bounou, 90min understands, as they look to cover the long-term absence of Thibaut Courtois. The Belgian suffered an ACL injury during a training session earlier this week and will soon undergo surgery, which will keep him on the sidelines for the vast majority of the 2023/24 La Liga season. With Ukraine international Andriy Lunin the only other goalkeeper in Carlo Ancelotti's squad, Madrid are prepared to enter the transfer market for a new stopper and have identified a number of potential targets. Contact has been made with former Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea, while Chelsea's Kepa Arrizabalaga is also seen as a candidate for a loan move, but sources have confirmed to 90min that Bounou is at the top of Madrid's wish list. 32-year-old Bounou, who excelled with Morocco at the World Cup, has made 157 appearances in La Liga across his career, emerging as one of the division's most-reliable stoppers since his switch to Sevilla in 2020. feed 90min understands that Bounou has made it clear he would like the chance to move to Madrid and Sevilla are prepared to do business for a fee of around    20m ( £17.3m). Madrid were not planning to do any additional business after an expensive shopping spree which brought Jude Bellingham, Arda Guler, Fran Garcia and Joselu to the club, but Courtois' serious injury has forced them back into the market. While club officials are understood to be fans of Lunin, there is a desire to bring in a goalkeeper with more La Liga experience as Ancelotti seeks to wrestle the league title back from rivals Barcelona. Defence was a real issue for Ancelotti during pre-season, with the Spanish side conceding eight goals across four games, and the injury to Courtois has only complicated his attempted solution.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Manchester City believe they have convinced both Bernardo Silva and Kyle Walker to stay at the club and sign new contracts, sources have confirmed to 90min. Both players have been considering their futures this summer and had been looking to leave the treble-winners during the transfer window. However, after allowing Riyad Mahrez to join Ilkay Gundogan out the exit door, Man City boss Pep Guardiola and the club's hierarchy have been firm with their stance that Silva and Walker must not be sold as well. 90min revealed earlier this summer that Walker, like Mahrez, was left furious at missing out on the Champions League final and had been looking at his options to leave. A move to former club Sheffield United failed to materialise as their takeover faltered, but the most serious interest emerged from Bayern Munich. Thomas Tuchel has pushed hard to land Walker and they offered the England defender a substantial offer to make the move, but 90min understands that Guardiola has persuaded the 33-year-old to extend his stay with the club. Walker's current deal is due to expire at the end of the 2023/24 season but this will be extended to 2025 with new terms. And the news continues to be positive at Man City as their similarly firm stance on Silva looks set to pay off. feed Silva has been looking to leave the club and there have been no shortage of suitors, with Barcelona pushing hard to sign a player who had long been eyeing a move to Catalonia. PSG were ready to pay Man City their asking price of around  £80m this summer, but Silva has been told he will not be allowed to leave. While Silva is keen to move on from Man City and has recently reiterated that desire to Guardiola, sources have told 90min that he is accepting there is little chance of any club being able to persuade them to sell. Silva's current deal runs to 2025, which means Man City are not under pressure to sanction a transfer, and because of that a new contract is now close to being finalised. As 90min previously revealed, Man City are willing to make Silva one of the best-paid players at the club and in the Premier League altogether, putting him close to the wage packets of teammates Erling Haaland and Kevin De Bruyne. Man City believe and hope that both Silva and Walker will put pen-to-paper on their new deals by the end of this month.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Manchester United are set to enter the transfer market to sign a new centre-back following the completion of Harry Maguire's  £30m move to West Ham, 90min understands. Maguire is in discussions over a move to east London after being made available for transfer this summer by Erik ten Hag, who has already stripped the 30-year-old of the United captaincy. Maguire had initially wanted to stay and fight for his place but is now likely to proceed with his Old Trafford departure after talks between the clubs progressed this week. The England international arrived in 2019 for  £80m, a world record transfer fee for a defender, but has suffered a difficult four years under successive managers Ten Hag, Ralf Rangnick and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. He has lost his place entirely in the team under the Dutchman, who has not deemed Maguire suitable to execute the style of football he'd like to implement in Manchester. It had been part of Ten Hag's long-term plan to phase out and replace Maguire, despite his public suggestions otherwise, and now his departure is nearing completion, United are exploring names to replace his position in the squad. They have been offered Benjamin Pavard, a French World Cup winner who has been looking to leave Bayern Munich for the duration of the summer. He would carry the added bonus of being able to cover at right-back should he swap southern Germany for north west England. Bayern are open to letting Pavard leave and he'd likely cost United in the region of what they'd receive for Maguire. feed Nice centre-back Jean-Clair Todibo is a younger alternative at a similar price under consideration, while Liverpool target Perr Schuurs, now of Torino but formerly of Ten Hag's Ajax, is also liked behind the scenes. Everton's Jarrad Branthwaite is another central defender United have been following. Edmond Tapsoba, a Tottenham target who plays for Bayer Leverkusen, represents a more expensive option if United choose to go down that route, though it remains to be seen at present how much they are prepared to outlay and how ambitious they'd like to be with their replacement. Benfica's Antonio Silva is understood to be loved by club scouts but potentially the most expensive of those named. The club are looking to raise funds through the sales of a number of squad players - not just that of Maguire - and are close to moving Fred out of Old Trafford, with several parties interested in the Brazilian. Donny van de Beek is also set to depart for Real Sociedad in the coming weeks, with United pushing for a permanent deal, while Scott McTominay is still of interest to West Ham, who are now threatened by interest from Manchester City in Lucas Paqueta.\",\n",

Sources have confirmed to 90min that Adams is now heading back to Leeds, with Chelsea no longer pursuing an agreement.

While Chelsea have not yet improved their bid of  £80m, they continue to explore their options in the hope of convincing Caicedo to choose Stamford Bridge over Anfield. At the same time, Lavia remains a real option for both Chelsea and Liverpool.

       "  'text': 'Jurgen Klopp is never shy in expressing his vehement distaste for numerous aspects of modern football\\'s calendar. Whether it\\'s Saturday lunchtime kick-offs or England\\'s festive fixture list, the Liverpool manager is quick to voice his criticism. The latest scheduling conflict to irk Klopp has been the closing date of the Saudi Pro League\\'s summer transfer window. \"I think pretty much the worst thing is that the transfer window in Saudi Arabia is three weeks longer open,\" Klopp argued ahead of the new Premier League season. \"That\\'s not helpful. So there must be, UEFA, FIFA must find solutions for that.\" Klopp knows the power that the Pro League wields better than most after watching two of his starting midfielders Jordan Henderson and Fabinho move to the Middle East this summer. Here\\'s exactly when the Saudi Pro League transfer window closes and how it compares to its European counterparts. Much like most European divisions and northern hemisphere leagues in general, the Saudi Pro League transfer window began on 1 July. Before the window had even officially opened, Saudi clubs had begun to reshape the transfer market with the earth-shattering arrival of Karim Benzema at top-flight champions Al Ittihad. While Cristiano Ronaldo\\'s move to Al Nassr last December was ground-breaking, the acquisition of the reigning Ballon d\\'Or winner was a statement move. There is still plenty of time for many more. The Saudi Arabian sports ministry has put aside around $800m ( £628m) for transfers to the top flight this summer, per the New York Times. The newly expanded 18-team league has until 20 September to splurge this hulking mass of capital. According to the detailed report in the New York Times, Saudi clubs were each provided with numerous transfer recommendations at the start of the window alongside a set of ground rules to prevent inter-league competition for players. During the seismic off-season, Saudi clubs have spent around  £350m to recruit the likes of Benzema, former Manchester City winger Riyad Mahrez and Sadio Mane from Bayern Munich. No team among Europe\\'s supposed elite has proven capable of matching the financial might from the Middle East. The Saudi Pro League\\'s chief operating officer Carlo Nohra explained to Reuters: \"We had to improve quality and in order to improve quality, you have to bring in the best. Spending was always going to be an essential component for us to do this.\" manual Klopp\\'s outburst was underpinned by the disparity between the closing dates of the transfer windows in England and Saudi Arabia. While the Pro League can continue to tempt players away with lucrative deals until the fourth week of September, the Premier League\\'s transfer window slams (it never closes quietly) shut on 1 September at 23:00 BST. When both windows are open, Premier League clubs can at least source replacements for the individuals that chased gold to the Gulf. Yet, there are 19 long days for Saudi sides to pilfer England\\'s helpless top flight. According to FIFA\\'s Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players, transfer windows are determined by each association. World football\\'s governing body stipulates that there must be two registration periods (summer and winter windows) and the first \"shall begin on the first day of the season. This period may not exceed 12 weeks.\" The 2023/24 season begins on 1 July 2023 for most leagues which run from autumn to spring. Therefore, the latest that the summer window could close would be on 23 September 2023. The Saudi Pro League have simply stretched the window to its limits while the Premier League plays by the same rules as the rest of Europe. League Closing date / time (BST) La Liga 01/09/2023 - 23:00 Serie A 01/09/2023 - 19:00 Bundesliga 01/09/2023 - 17:00 Ligue 1 01/09/2023 - 22:00 This year, all of the major European leagues will also close at varying times on 1 September. The Premier League voted to close their summer window in 2018 and 2019 when the season\\'s fixtures began during August, theoretically providing every manager with a settled squad for each match in the first half of the campaign. However, the rest of Europe didn\\'t follow suit, giving those on the continent ample opportunity to poach Premier League stars without any chance of retaliation. After two years, Premier League clubs voted to get back \"in sync\" with the rest of Europe. Now, the continent\\'s elite teams are out of step with the Saudi Pro League - which has already spent more on transfers than La Liga. Whether this will lead to an extension of future summer windows remains to be seen. But there will be no solution for a grumpy Klopp this year.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Tottenham Hotspur head coach Ange Postecoglou has admitted that Harry Kane was \\'unlikely\\' to stay at the club this season ahead of his move to Bayern Munich. 90min reported on Thursday that Spurs had finally relented and accepted an  £86.4m (   100m) bid from the German champions. Kane will fly to Germany on Friday to finalise the transfer. Spurs boss Postecoglou insisted last week that he simply wanted the saga resolved as soon as possible to plan for the season ahead. Ahead of Sunday\\'s trip to Brentford for his Premier League debut, Postecoglou was understandably asked for an update on Kane. \"It\\'s fair to say I don\\'t have a blow by blow account of the whole thing but fair to say it\\'s progressed to the point where it looks like it\\'s going to happen. We move forward without Harry. It gives us clarity and unless something unforeseen happens we\\'ll move on,\" he said. \"I didn\\'t see the point in [pitching myself] because whatever I was going to say was going to be irrelevant. I could plan his grand vision but I\\'m sure he\\'d heard it all before. My feeling was we\\'ll get to know each other, that\\'s the best way to navigate this early bit. Having said that, in my mind after that initial conversation [on the first day], he\\'d made up his mind that if the clubs agreed he\\'d go but he was also happy to stay if they didn\\'t. \"It\\'s best Harry speaks for himself on the decision but there\\'s no doubts he\\'s one of the greats of this football club. His record speaks for himself. I\\'m only new in the building but I\\'m certainly not the spokesman for this football club in declaring people\\'s status but I think it\\'s clear Harry Kane is one of the greats. \"I think if you\\'re involved in football as long as I have, you know clubs are not going to talk to each other without the player knowing. We weren\\'t talking to Wolfsburg without knowing Micky van de Ven wanted to come. \"[Harry and I] had a chat on the first day. He was up front and honest that if they could agree a deal then he would go. He wanted it decided by the first game and that was my preference as well.\" manual When asked how Tottenham will go about replacing Kane, Postecoglou added: \"I don\\'t think there\\'s a like for like replacement for Harry. We\\'ve been planning for this for a while to be fair. It doesn\\'t take too much investigative work to know that this was going to happen. Our business up to now reflects that. \"I don\\'t think it works that way [giving Daniel Levy a list of strikers to get]. It\\'s not like the family shopping list to go and get milk and bread for the kids. My whole strategy has been that Harry was unlikely to be around so it wasn\\'t like we had a pow wow this morning.\" 90min revealed earlier this week that Spurs representatives had touched base with other forwards, including Gent starlet Gift Orban.',\n",

       "  'text': 'West Ham United manager David Moyes has provided an update on the club\\'s pursuit of Manchester United defender Harry Maguire. 90min reported on Wednesday that the two clubs had agreed terms on a  £30m transfer fee after the Hammers agreed to up their wage offer. Ahead of West Ham\\'s Premier League season opener away to Bournemouth, Moyes was asked for the latest on the saga. \"We\\'ve had a bid accepted from Manchester United, but while he\\'s not our player I\\'m not in a position to discuss him,\" he replied. feed While Maguire has not officially left the club yet, 90min understands Man Utd are stepping up plans to bring in a replacement centre-back. Bayern Munich\\'s Benjamin Pavard has been offered to the Red Devils and has made it clear in recent months that he wants to continue his playing career at centre-back as opposed to right-back. Nice\\'s Jean-Clair Todibo, Everton\\'s Jarrad Branthwaite, Torino\\'s Perr Schuurs and Bayer Leverkusen\\'s Edmond Tapsoba are all on Man Utd\\'s shortlist. Maguire was stripped of the club captaincy this summer and removed entirely from Man Utd\\'s leadership group, with Bruno Fernandes being promoted to skipper. West Ham, meanwhile, have finally made some movement in the transfer market after a quiet summer window. They recently completed the signing of Ajax midfielder Edson Alvarez, with Southampton captain James Ward-Prowse set to follow.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp admits his previous comments on heavy spending were wrong  in the wake of the Reds\\'  £111m agreement to sign Moises Caicedo from Brighton. Caicedo is set to become the most expensive signing in the history of English football after Liverpool agreed to pay Brighton  £111m to sign the midfielder, but critics were quick to recall Klopp\\'s previous criticisms of such heavy spending. Indeed, in 2016, Klopp was left stunned by Manchester United\\'s  £89m acquisition of Paul Pogba - a world record at the time - and vowed he would never pull the trigger on such a deal. \"The day that this is football, I\\'m not in a job anymore, because the game is about playing together,\" Klopp said at the time. \"Other clubs can go out and spend more money and collect top players. I want to do it differently. I would even do it differently if I could spend that money.\" feed Having now agreed to sign Caicedo for  £111m in the same summer as Dominik Szoboszlai and Alexis Mac Allister moved to Liverpool for a combined  £95m, Klopp confessed the market has been thrown into turmoil since his comments on Pogba. \"Everything changed,\" he told a press conference on Friday. \"Do I like it? No, but did I realise I was wrong? Definitely. Definitely. That\\'s the way it goes. It\\'s not great, it\\'s not top. Saudi Arabia will not help with that. I\\'m not blaming it, but another market with a lot of money. \"In the end, we as a club, we have to try make sure that we, with our resources, get the best possible team together. We try everything to bring together the best squad for us, and we are not in dreamland, so it\\'s not like we can just point at players and bring them in. \"If people want to throw my quotes from five or six years ago at me, no problem. That\\'s what I thought that day, and I realise now I was wrong, easy to admit that.\"',\n",

The Hammers have been desperately trying to strengthen their squad after selling Declan Rice to Arsenal in a British-record  £105m transfer. Things have been slow moving for West Ham, amid internal conflicts between manager David Moyes and new technical director Tim Steidten, but progress has been made over the past 48 hours on a number of targets. Edson Alvarez has completed a medical in London ahead of a  £34m move from Ajax, while West Ham have also agreed a  £30m fee for former Manchester United skipper Harry Maguire - he is now due to discuss personal terms over a move to the East End. And sources have confirmed to 90min that after lengthy negotiations, West Ham have agreed a  £30m deal with Southampton for Ward-Prowse, with an additional sell-on clause, having seen a bid for the same amount rejected by United for Scott McTominay. feed It had looked as though West Ham's move for central midfielder Ward-Prowse would fall through, with Southampton wanting more money for the 28-year-old, but terms have now been agreed between the two parties ahead of the opening weekend of the Premier League season. It's expected he will sign a four-year contract should he come through a medical unscathed. Ward-Prowse has been at Southampton for the entirety of his career, making 422 appearances on the south coast and scoring 55 goals. He has also provided 55 assists in that time, while his unerring accuracy from free-kicks has drawn comparisons to David Beckham. West Ham hope to complete deals for half a dozen players before the summer window closes, with attention now set to turn to strengthening in the wide forward areas and with a striker.\",\n",

The Blues failed with an  £80m offer and were considering returning with a bid closer to Brighton's  £100m asking price when Liverpool swooped in and agreed a British record deal worth  £111m to sign the 21-year-old. Nothing has been signed between Brighton and Liverpool, however, and sources have confirmed to 90min that Chelsea are refusing to accept defeat in the race. Chelsea have informed Caicedo's representatives that they are prepared to battle to try and sign the midfielder and will not give up hope until he has put pen to paper on a deal with Liverpool. As it stands, Chelsea have not made a new bid for Caicedo, with Liverpool the only side to have seen an offer accepted. Before Liverpool's offer arrived, 90min understood that Caicedo's preference was to join Chelsea this summer, with the midfielder repeatedly making it clear to Brighton that he wanted to be allowed to speak to the Blues. feed Caicedo has not yet travelled to Merseyside for a scheduled medical, 90min further understands, and Chelsea are using the time to try and work on a solution. Brighton are hoping to sell Caicedo to the highest bidder and wasted little time in accepting Liverpool's offer, which was significantly higher than any proposal put forward until now by Chelsea. The two clubs, who ironically meet in their opening Premier League fixture on Sunday, have also butted heads  over Southampton midfielder Romeo Lavia. The Reds failed with three bids for the Belgian, the last of which was worth  £46m, before Chelsea arrived with an offer of  £48m. Southampton value Lavia at  £50m and are not prepared to compromise on their price. Where Caicedo ends up remains to be seen, but the twists and turns of the transfer have made it one of the most fascinating sagas of what's been an extraordinary window to date.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Manchester United have agreed to sell Harry Maguire to West Ham United for a  £30m fee, sources have confirmed to 90min. The England international was removed from his position as club captain last month, with Bruno Fernandes taking over the role at Old Trafford. 90min revealed on Monday that West Ham had made a  £30m bid for Maguire with his long-term future at United uncertain, but the bid was turned down at the time. Part of the reason why United knocked back this offer was the belief that the Hammers would be unable to satisfy Maguire's wage demands, but after West Ham informed the Red Devils on Wednesday their willingness to amend their contract offer to the centre-back, the two clubs have come to an agreement. Though Maguire has not been 100% convinced of leaving Man Utd this transfer window, 90min understands he is open to a move and it looks likely that he will now accept West Ham's offer. feed Should Maguire complete a move to London Stadium, United will make a  £50m loss on the 30-year-old following his world-record move from Leicester City in 2019 which made him the most expensive defender in football history. Maguire fell out of favour under Erik ten Hag last season, with Lisandro Martinez displacing him from the starting lineup and often featuring alongside Raphael Varane. Victor Lindelof has also usurped Maguire in the pecking order, with Luke Shaw also preferred in a central role at times. West Ham remain interested in Man Utd midfielder Scott McTominay, who was also the subject of a  £30m bid this week, but the Red Devils are continuing to hold out for a higher fee for the Scotland international. Ajax's Edson Alvarez is close to finalising a move to east London, - he's undergone a medical and is set to pen a five-year deal - while West Ham have also agreed to pay Southampton  £30m for their captain James Ward-Prowse - a move that may prevent an improved offer being made for McTominay.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Liverpool have held talks over potentially trumping Chelsea's latest offer for Brighton midfielder Moises Caicedo, 90min understands. Chelsea have seen multiple bids for Caicedo rejected already this summer, with Brighton holding out for  £100m. While talks between the two sides remain on, Chelsea have also stepped up their pursuit of potential alternatives. Indeed, a bid was recently lodged for Southampton midfielder Romeo Lavia - the subject of three failed offers from Liverpool. With Chelsea threatening to hijack the pursuit of Lavia, sources have confirmed to 90min that Liverpool have made a late move over potentially beating Mauricio Pochettino's side to Caicedo. Sources have stressed that Liverpool have not yet submitted a formal offer for Caicedo but have held talks with Brighton as they explore a possible move to exceed Chelsea's  £80m proposal. feed 90min understands that Caicedo's preference would be to join Chelsea over Liverpool, but it remains to be seen whether that stance would change if the Reds see an offer accepted. Chelsea sources insist that the Blues remain well in the fight for Caicedo as well as Lavia, with Leeds United's Tyler Adams another target on the table. Liverpool are desperate to continue bolstering their midfield after the surprise departures of Jordan Henderson and Fabinho to Saudi Arabia, and Jurgen Klopp's side have spent a large part of the summer focused on Lavia. Three bids have been knocked back by Southampton, the latest of which was worth around  £46m, and Chelsea have moved to try and win the race for Lavia with an offer of  £48m -  £2m short of the Saints'  £50m asking price.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"West Ham United do not intend to sell Lucas Paqueta despite Manchester City making a verbal offer of  £70m for the Brazilian, sources have confirmed to 90min. The 25-year-old established himself as a key player in David Moyes' side during the second half of last season, helping the club to a famous win over Fiorentina in the Europa Conference League final. But despite that success, and West Ham's subsequent qualification for the Europa League, Paqueta wasn't overly impressed with how the 2022/23 season went, with 90min exclusively revealing in June that the Brazilian has particular concerns about working under Moyes. Paqueta has had to adapt his style of play to fit into Moyes' system, and although his performance levels significantly improved after the winter World Cup in Qatar, it's clear that the Brazilian's natural instincts are compromised by West Ham sitting deep and looking to hit teams on the counter. The former AC Milan and Lyon midfielder parted company with his long-term agents earlier this summer, and it's understood his new representation have been assessing potential landing spots for Paqueta during the current transfer window.  Paris Saint-Germain showed interest in Paqueta earlier this summer and retain an interest in his services, while the recently appointed director of the Saudi Pro League, Michael Emenalo, is keeping apprised of the midfielder's situation at West Ham. 90min has also learned of significant interest from Premier League champions Manchester City, who have made a verbal offer of  £70m for Paqueta. West Ham have turned that bid down and have insisted that they do not intend to sell Paqueta, however sources have told 90min that an offer 'too good to turn down' would be considered. feed Whether or not City return for Paqueta remains to be seen, but they certainly have the financial capability to offer West Ham an increased figure - the money at their disposal evidenced by their  £90m bid for Declan Rice earlier this summer. It's also rare for City to engage in talks unless they have a genuine belief of signing a player. City's interest stems from their desire to replace Ilkay Gundogan and Riyad Mahrez, who have left for Barcelona and Al Ahli respectively, but isn't believed to be connected to a potential sale of Bernardo Silva. 90min recently revealed that Barcelona have made fresh contact with Silva in an attempt to prise the Portuguese international away from City, but they have no intention to sell at this point. Paris Saint-Germain are also interested in the 28-year-old. 90min further understands that Newcastle's long-term interest in Paqueta has not waned, but a deal may be difficult for them to do because of Financial Fair Play regulations. A loan with obligation to buy  appears to be the only way the Magpies could facilitate a move this summer, though that is unlikely to happen at this stage.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Carlo Ancelotti has insisted Real Madrid have total faith in Ukraine international Andriy Lunin as they consider their goalkeeping options in the wake of Thibaut Courtois\\' injury. Courtois is set to undergo surgery after tearing his ACL in training and is subsequently expected to miss the vast majority of the upcoming campaign, leaving Madrid with Lunin as their only senior goalkeeper. As 90min reported following Courtois\\' injury, Madrid have not yet ruled out keeping Lunin as their starting goalkeeper, although club officials are drawing up a list of potential targets as they seek to bolster in the position once again. After contact was made with free agent David de Gea, Madrid focused their efforts on Sevilla stopper Yassine Bounou, who is keen to make the move this summer. However, with Lunin set to start the campaign in goal as Madrid open their season against Athletic Club on Saturday, Ancelotti reiterated his faith in the 24-year-old. feed \"Emotionally, it was not a good day,\" Ancelotti told a press conference. \"We are sad on a personal level as it is an injury to an important player, but these things happen in football. \"We wish [Courtois] a speedy recovery and we give all the confidence in the world to Lunin, who is a great goalkeeper. In pre-season, he did well. Total confidence in him, we think he is a talent. What he lacks is what everyone lacks, experience, but he will take it game by game.\" Asked whether he would like a new signing, Ancelotti responded: \"We have time until 31 August. Behind Lunin, our goalkeepers have potential, but they are young. We will think about it. Fran [Gonzalez] is 17 years old. \"If we sign a new goalkeeper, we will do it for numbers because we have confidence in Lunin. The confidence in Lunin is total.\" Ancelotti ended with a simple assessment of the sort of goalkeeper he would like to see Madrid bring in.    One that stops the ball with his hands,\" the Italian quipped. \"First and foremost, one that makes saves. That is what I ask of all goalkeepers. Let them be good with their hands. When it comes to feet, it\\'s better to have a striker.\"',\n",

Having seen Kane enter the final year of his contract, Spurs have begrudgingly accepted a bid from Bayern worth    100m ( £86.4m) but have long been determined to convince the England international to reject their advances and stay. While Bayern were confident an agreement with Spurs was all that was missing in their pursuit of Kane, sources have confirmed to 90min that the 30-year-old has not yet given his approval to a move to Munich. Kane is understood to be considering his options, one of which is to remain with Spurs beyond this summer, and sources close to the club are now hopeful that Kane will agree to remain at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium for at least one more season. The striker informed both Spurs and Bayern earlier this week that he wanted his future resolved by the time the new Premier League season kicks off this weekend, with Spurs due to play Brentford on Sunday. feed Bayern themselves wanted a deal wrapped up when they lodged a third bid which was also worth    100m, but based around a less-favourable payment structure for the Premier League side. But they did not get the immediate response they were hoping for as Spurs chairman Daniel Levy delayed his eventual rejection. They have now seen a bid accepted which would satisfy Kane's deadline but the striker has not yet given the green light - a hesitance which has left Spurs optimistic about their chances of keeping the striker. Should Kane stay, he would be able to discuss a free transfer overseas in January, with Spurs at risk of losing him for free next summer, when Premier League rivals would also be able to offer a contract. Spurs have long been determined to keep Kane and have never given up on convincing the England captain to sign a new contract further down the line.\",\n",

Wahi has generated considerable interest this summer, with Arsenal and Chelsea among his Premier League suitors - the latter have been made a verbal offer. Ligue 1 giants Monaco are also considering a bid, though crucially they can't offer European football this season like West Ham can, and Eintracht Frankfurt think Wahi could be the ideal fit to replace Randal Kolo Muani. Kolo Muani has been strongly linked with Paris Saint-Germain and Bayern Munich this summer, as well as Manchester United, and 90min understands that West Ham have enquired about his potential price tag too - PSG are leading the charge though as they cast Kylian Mbappe to one side in a furious dispute over his future, and it looks increasingly likely that Kolo Muani will return to Ligue 1 if a fee can be agreed. Montpellier are expected to demand a fee of at least  £35m for Wahi, though they still may look to keep him after renewing his contract just six months ago. West Ham's other major piece of business surrounds the interest from Premier League champions Manchester City in Lucas Paqueta. A verbal  £70m offer was swiftly rejected by the Hammers, who don't want to sell the Brazilian, but it's expected that the treble winners will imminently return with an improved bid.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Real Madrid are now in the market for a new goalkeeper after Thibaut Courtois suffered a potential season-ending injury this week.  The Belgian shot-stopper suffered an ACL injury which will unfortunately require surgery and an extremely lengthy spell on the sidelines.  In the imemdiate term Andriy Lunin will stand in. But here's the options available to Madrid in what remains of this summer transfer window in order to replace the stricken Courtois... feed Diogo Costa is the best goalkeeper on this list. That is a fact. The Porto star is an archtypal modern goalie who is as equally with the ball at his feet as he is in between the sticks. So why is he the last on these options, you ask? Well the fact that he has a  £65m (   75m) release clause in his contract - something which we highly doubt Real Madrid would pay. Likelihood: 1/10 The 22-year-old has been consistently linked with a move away from Valencia in recent months, so it only makes sense to add him to list of potential Courtois deputies. The  £25m asking price that Valencia have put on the goalkeeper makes any move unlikely however, especially when there's much, much cheaper options who would do as good a job currently on the market. Likelihood: 2/10  Recently linked with a move to Bayern, regular Premier League viewers are well aware of Kepa Arrizabalaga's deficiencies. He's not all bad though, and if Chelsea are desperate to get ride of him this summer then he could be available for an okay price.Kepa was actually heavily linked with Madrid once before, way back in 2018.Likelihood: 4/10  Even before the news broke that Thibaut Courtois was set to miss the majority of the season, David Soria was being linked with a move to the Santiago Bernabeu. A deal was reported to have fallen through in July due to a mixture of Getafe wanting  £8m for his services and Soria not being keen on becoming a second choice goalkeeper. With the opportunity to become Madrid's first-choice shot-stopper for a season now available, Soria may be more keen to join the club. Likelihood: 6/10  Three UEFA Champions Leagues, one La Liga and four FIFA Club World Cups. It's fair to say that Keylor Navas enjoyed his previous stint at Real Madrid. His success at the club in the mid-2010s, coupled with his availability due to lowly position in the PSG goalkeeper ranks means this deal would make a lot of sense. Likelihood: 8/10  Once upon a time, David de Gea was a fax machine away from joining Real Madrid for around  £30m.Now, Madrid can sign the goalkeeper as a free agent and not have worry about paying a fee or rely on a fax machine to work properly. He's the logical choice. Likelihood: 10/10\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Harry Kane is set to leave Tottenham Hotspur this summer after agreeing to join German champions Bayern Munich, 90min understands. Bayern lodged four bids for the England striker, eventually agreeing to a    100m ( £86.4m) deal to lure Kane away, but the striker himself did not immediately give his approval to a move as he considered all his options. While the initial delay left Spurs feeling hopeful they may have convinced their captain to stay, 90min understands that Kane has now accepted Bayern's proposal and is set to leave the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium this summer. Kane, who set a deadline of Sunday to resolve his future, is due in Germany on Friday to undergo a medical ahead of signing a four-year contract with the Bundesliga champions. However, Spurs have currently delayed signing off on the deal and are keen to finalise each and every minor detail before allowing Kane to depart. Bayern are hopeful that Kane will be in attendance for Saturday's Super Cup clash with RB Leipzig, perhaps even playing a role in the match if all goes to plan. feed The move to Germany, if sealed as expected, will bring an end to Kane's 19-year association with Tottenham, in which he has racked up 280 goals in 435 appearances. Kane's pursuit of Alan Shearer's all-time Premier League top scorer record will also be halted, perhaps permanently. The 30-year-old has struck 213 times in the competition, 47 fewer than Blackburn and Newcastle icon Shearer. While they had been hopeful of keeping Kane, Spurs have been exploring potential replacements for the England captain in anticipation of a departure. Argentina youth international Alejo Veliz has agreed to join but Spurs are also looking at the likes of Gent's Gift Orban, Montpellier's Elye Wahi and Lille's Jonathan David. Aleksandar Mitrovic of Fulham is also on Spurs' radar. The Serb was keen to leave for Saudi Arabia earlier this summer but has seen a move blocked by Fulham, who are demanding  £50m to part ways with their star striker.\",\n",

Alvarez has emerged as one of West Ham's top targets this summer, and is the choice of recently appointed technical director Tim Steidten. Steidten and manager David Moyes have been struggling to agree on targets throughout the summer. That has now seen West Ham switch focus to Alvarez after failing to seal deals for Southampton's James Ward-Prowse and Manchester United's Scott McTominay. West Ham, despite the record sale of Declan Rice, have yet to make a breakthrough in the transfer market and that plight was highlighted at the weekend as they were hammered 4-0 by Bayer Leverkusen - ironically Steidten's former club. He has now pushed ahead with a move for Alvarez in an attempt to get something done before the start of the Premier League season next weekend. feed Now, West Ham have made an initial offer  £25.9m for Alvarez. Although that isn't considered enough by Ajax, who are seeking just over  £30m, talks have continued and are at an advanced stage. Alvarez was a target for Chelsea last year and almost joined Borussia Dortmund earlier this summer, before that deal fell through to give West Ham the opportunity to try and land him. 90min understands the Hammers are looking to bring in up to six players before the summer window closes and getting the Alvarez deal over the line is seen as a key breakthrough in the transfer market.\",\n",

West Ham saw an opening offer for former captain Maguire worth  £20m rebuffed last month before a more recent second proposal of  £30m was also dismissed by United. The Hammers also firmed up their interest in another United star in the shape of Scottish midfielder McTominay but, like with Maguire, the Red Devils were not willing to do business at the  £30m mark. 90min understands the actual offers were not too far away from United's valuation, but the overall deals including the wages West Ham could afford or were willing to provide were not sufficient enough to tempt the Old Trafford giants into selling either player. United, who themselves have spent more than  £100m this summer on Andre Onana, Mason Mount and Rasmus Hojlund, are anxious to move players on to finance other deals and Erik ten Hag has sanctioned the departures of both Maguire and McTominay.  However, neither player is desperate to move. feed Maguire remains unconvinced that his future is best served away from the club despite having the captaincy stripped, while McTominay also believes he could yet play his way into Ten Hag's plans given fellow midfielders Donny van de Beek and Fred are expected to move this summer.  West Ham - who are the only team to make firm offers for either Maguire or McTominay this summer - are now considering improved bids for the two players. They are also looking to complete the signing of Ajax midfielder Edson Alvarez in the coming days.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'As the coronavirus pandemic forced the world to pause, Alejo Veliz seriously considered pressing stop on his dreams of becoming a professional footballer. The 16-year-old had just begun pre-season with Central Rosario\\'s youth team when COVID-19 hit. \"I couldn\\'t go back and I started to think about studying something because it took too long,\" Veliz remembered. \"Thank God I stayed.\" Veliz made his debut for the senior side 18 months after the pandemic\\'s outbreak and has been a fixture of the first team since 2022. This summer, the teenager has attracted increasing interest from the Premier League\\'s Tottenham Hotspur. Aside from an iron will, here\\'s why Spurs are leading the race for a player who almost gave up the game entirely three years ago.    ¥          Alejo V  liz, 1 a 0 y explota el Gigante pic.twitter.com/mIBkaAWChy Veliz made his debut for Central in July 2021. Within 12 months, he had entered club folklore. Half-time was rapidly approaching in the fiercely contested Rosarian derby against Newell\\'s Old Boys when Jhonatan Candia swung a free kick into the box. Veliz, who stands at 6\\'1, out-jumped his marker to loop Central into a lead. The only goal of the game sparked an ear-splitting roar in the Gigante de Arroyito. Veliz has many years of football ahead of him but will have to go some way to top a decisive contribution against your first club\\'s biggest rivals. The winner against Newell\\'s was only the third goal of Veliz\\'s senior career but it would prove to be a prescient participation. Six of Veliz\\'s 19 goals for Central exploded off his forehead and all three of his strikes during this year\\'s under-20 World Cup were headers. Harry Kane broke the Premier League record for headed goals in a single season last term, notching ten. Tottenham\\'s talisman took advantage of the team\\'s myriad of set-piece ploys sketched up by the specialist coach Gianni Vio. The Italian may have parted ways with the club this summer but new manager Ange Postecoglou developed a range of routines during his time at Celtic. While Veliz would offer another aerial target other than Kane it would be an almighty task for the youngster to replace the England captain entirely if a move to Bayern Munich does materialise. Veliz may be one of the Argentine top flight\\'s most exciting young strikers but he is best described as promising rather than prolific and still has plenty of rough edges to smooth - notably, his ability (or willingness) to create for others. If the teenager does move to Tottenham, it will surely be in an understudy role to the first choice option - whether that be Kane or the misfiring Richarlison. What Veliz does bring in abundance is grit. During Carlos Tevez\\'s brief five months as Central coach, Veliz said that he \"took every piece of advice he gave me\". That tenacity embodied by the former Manchester United and Manchester City striker is evident in Veliz on and off the pitch. In April of this year, the day after scoring in a 2-2 draw against Boca Juniors, Veliz was driving to training when he was T-boned by a truck which fled the scene. He started Central\\'s next match the following week. Just four days after playing in Argentina\\'s last-16 exit from this summer\\'s under-20 World Cup, Veliz not only appeared for Central but scored in a 4-1 win over Instituto. Team Appearances Goals Assists Rosario Central 62 19 2 Argentina Under-20s 9 3 0 feed An impressive tally of 11 goals in 23 top-flight games for Central this year - the highest tally of any teenager in the division - has attracted interest from across Europe. The bulk of bids swamping Rosario Central\\'s transfer department stemmed from Serie A. AC Milan, Roma, Salernitana and Torino all expressed interest in the 19-year-old, who set tongues wagging at a greater velocity with his forceful displays in this year\\'s under-20 World Cup. Tottenham\\'s Premier League rivals Nottingham Forest also flirted with Veliz but 90min understands that the striker is prioritising a move to north London after Spurs agreed to meet his  £13m release clause. However, when Veliz will line up for the Lilywhites remains to be seen. Spurs are expected to hand Veliz a long-term deal but may be prepared to loan the striker back to Central in the immediate future. The Rosario club are certainly trying to keep hold of their talented forward - who would join the likes of Angel Di Maria and his potential Tottenham teammate Giovani Lo Celso in big-money moves away from Central. Talk of a loan until January, if not longer, has been floated. Just three short years ago, Veliz didn\\'t look like making a professional appearance for any club, let alone one in the world\\'s biggest league.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Harry Kane has informed Tottenham that he will not look to leave the club once the new Premier League season gets underway, 90min understands. Kane has entered the final year of his Spurs contract and has been pursued heavily by Bayern Munich, who have seen three bids knocked back for the England striker, the last of which was a club-record offer worth    100m ( £86m). Bayern had stressed that their third offer would be their last but are understood to be considering a fourth approach for Kane. While the German giants explore their options, sources have confirmed to 90min that Kane has made it clear he will not consider a move away from Spurs once the new season gets underway this weekend. Spurs are due to travel across London to face Brentford on 13 August and, if he is still at the club on that date, then Kane plans to remain for at least the whole campaign. feed That message has been conveyed to Bayern, who now have less than week to make a decision over a fourth bid. Spurs chairman Daniel Levy has not yet given a firm asking price and remains determined to not only keep Kane at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, but also to convince the 30-year-old to put pen to paper on a new contract. Bayern's hierarchy are understood to be divided on their next move. While some are encouraging an improved bid, others believe they are fighting a losing battle and are keen to start looking elsewhere. Scouts have drawn up reports on alternative targets, with the likes of Juventus' Dusan Vlahovic and Eintracht Frankfurt's Randal Kolo Muani on Bayern's radar.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Tottenham Hotspur are in talks with Galatasaray over the potential sale of two first-team players, sources have conformed to 90min. Spurs are looking to trim down their squad for new head coach Ange Postecoglou and ahead of a season in which they will not be competing in European football for the first time since 2009/10. 90min reported last month that Davinson Sanchez had been granted permission to discuss a move away, with Strasbourg and Spartak Moscow interested in his services. Talks are ongoing with the Russian club over a move, but they now face competition from Turkish side Galatasaray, who recently bolstered their ranks with the high-profile addition of Wilfried Zaha. Sanchez has other suitors from the Premier League too, with Fulham, Nottingham Forest and Wolves all making enquiries to Spurs. Galatasaray have also been offered the chance to bring in Tottenham's club-record signing Tanguy Ndombele. The France midfielder spent last season on loan at Napoli, helping them win Serie A, and he is now seen as a possible alternative to Manchester United's Fred by Galatasaray. Ndombele was set to feature on Spurs' pre-season tour of Australia and Asia, but sustained an injury prior to their first friendly and has only just returned to training. feed Lazio are on the verge of signing free agent Daichi Kamada after AC Milan backed out of a deal last month. The Rossoneri had been expected to sign the Japan midfielder from Eintracht Frankfurt but pulled the plug following a shake-up among their transfer decision-makers. Tottenham and West Ham held talks with Kamada's representatives about a move but both ultimately stopped short of offering him a contract, and he will now put pen to paper on a contract with Lazio. A superb summer for Bournemouth is set to continue with the signing of Fiorentina midfielder Gaetano Castrovilli for a fee that could reach  £13.7m. The Cherries have ousted competition from Serie A giants Inter and Lazio for his signature, while Napoli had also made enquiries earlier this window. Castrovilli will arrive in England to undergo a medical on Friday and seal his move to the Vitality Stadium. While Fiorentina will lose Castrovilli, they will add Yerry Mina to their squad following his release from Everton. The Colombia international has completed his medical and will serve as a replacement for Igor, who recently signed for Brighton & Hove Albion. Fulham had held talks with Mina regarding a move but he is heading to Italy instead.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Liverpool legend and Al Ettifaq manager Steven Gerrard has admitted he does not want to see Mohamed Salah follow him to Saudi Arabia. The Reds have already lost two key players to Saudi Arabia this summer, with Fabinho joining Al Ittihad and captain Jordan Henderson linking back up with Gerrard at Al Ettifaq, and Saudi officials are understood to be keen to sign Salah. Fortunately for Liverpool fans, Salah\\'s agent has already publicly shot down the rumours, insisting the Egyptian does not want to leave Anfield this summer. That stance will have gone down well with Gerrard, who recently confessed that he would rather see Salah fire Liverpool to more success before making a move to the Middle East. feed Asked by Sada Al Mala   eb if he would want to sign Salah, Gerrard responded: \"No! No, no - the answer is no, because Mohamed Salah is my favourite player, I love Liverpool Football Club, so Mohamed can stay where he is. \"When he wins more leagues and more Champions Leagues with Liverpool, we\\'ll maybe consider it.\" Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp recently urged FIFA to look at reducing the length of the Saudi transfer window, which runs until 20 September - 19 days after the European window slams shut. \"The influence of Saudi Arabia is massive at the moment,\" Klopp said. \"Pretty much the worst thing is that the transfer window in Saudi Arabia is open three weeks longer. If I am right, I heard something like that, then at least in Europe that   s not helpful. \"UEFA or FIFA must find solutions for that. It   s already influential for us but we will have to learn to deal with it.\"',\n",

       "  'text': \"Arsenal have agreed a fee with Brentford for the transfer of goalkeeper David Raya, sources have confirmed to 90min. The Spain international has been looking to leave the Bees this summer after turning down various offers of a new contract. His current deal expires in 2024. Brentford have been willing to facilitate a sale but their initial  £40m asking price put off various suitors. Tottenham Hotspur agreed personal terms with Raya but backed away from a deal due to this valuation, while Bayern Munich also dropped their interest for similar reasons. 90min understands Arsenal's opening offer of  £20m plus a further  £5m in add-ons was knocked back by the Bees, but they have now succeeded with a new bid which is believed to be worth  £30m in total. Raya has been determined to secure a move to the Emirates Stadium and he is expected to undergo a medical shortly. feed The Gunners have long-admired Raya and tried to sign him back in 2020, but were unable to get a deal over the line. Arsenal goalkeeper coach Inaki Cana worked with the Spaniard during his brief spell at Brentford. Raya will provide competition for England international Aaron Ramsdale though is not expected to be the immediate first-choice goalkeeper at Arsenal. Since Brentford were promoted from the Championship in 2021, Raya has proven to be one of the Premier League's leading goalkeepers due to his shot-stopping and ability to play from the back. Brentford will head into the new season with Netherlands international Mark Flekken as their starting goalkeeper following his summer arrival from Freiburg\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Paris Saint-Germain are continuing to explore ways of parting with Neymar this summer, sources have confirmed to 90min. Neymar has been unsettled for months in the French capital but his team of representatives, led by his father, insist that they are not leading the push for an exit. The 31-year-old\\'s father, Neymar Da Silva Santos, was quick to deny reports from French daily L\\'Equipe which stated that the Brazilian had told PSG that he wants to leave the club. \"I can\\'t confirm a news that didn\\'t happen. L\\'Equipe being L\\'Efake, this came from somewhere, let\\'s try to understand the intention,\" the senior Neymar told PL Brasil. Sources have told 90min that while Neymar is unsettled, it is PSG who are working hard to try and move him on. A return to Barcelona has been mooted but, although president Joan Laporta is believed to be keen, manager Xavi is not believed to be looking at Neymar as a realistic target - instead preferring they focus on Manchester City\\'s Bernardo Silva. Chelsea have also been linked, with club owner Todd Boehly a confirmed fan, but the Blues have not yet indicated any desire to make a move for Neymar this summer despite being contacted by those working on the deal. Contact has also been made with representatives of the Saudi Pro League and the Public Investment Fund (PIF), who also own Newcastle. PIF would love to lure Neymar to St James\\' Park but would also consider recruiting the 31-year-old for one of their Saudi outfits: Al Ittihad, Al Nassr, Al Ahli or Al Hilal. feed PSG are currently locked in talks with PIF over the potential sale of midfielder Marco Verratti, but they are struggling to agree a fee as they demand nearly double the initial    30m ( £26m) offer that has come in. It was during these conversations that Neymar\\'s name was first mentioned. 90min understands that Verratti remains unhappy with the treatment of both Neymar and Kylian Mbappe, who has been put up for sale and banished from first-team training after refusing to extend his contract. Verratti has made those concerns known to the club\\'s hierarchy. New manager Luis Enrique is keen to keep the Italian but is believed to be open to parting ways with Neymar this summer. PSG are already working hard on new signings for Enrique and have bolstered in attack with the signing of Goncalo Ramos, who has joined on an initial loan from Benfica which comes with an option for a permanent    80m ( £69m) move to the French capital next summer. Eintracht Frankfurt\\'s Randal Kolo Muani is also a key target and personal terms have been agreed with the 24-year-old.',\n",

A  £38m deal was agreed with Monaco earlier this week to bring Disasi, who was playing alongside current Blues defender Benoit Badiashile last season, over to Stamford Bridge. The deal is now complete, with 25-year-old Disasi signing a six-year contract to commit himself to Chelsea until 2029. \"Axel has showcased his quality over several seasons in France and that has deservedly led to recognition on the international stage,\" said sporting directors Paul Winstanley and Laurence Stewart, the latter of whom joined from Monaco in February. \"He is ready to take the next step in his career and we are delighted that will be with Chelsea. We welcome him to the club and look forward to him joining up with Mauricio Pochettino and his new teammates in the days ahead.\" feed Disasi becomes Chelsea\\'s sixth signing of the summer, following Christopher Nkunku, Nicolas Jackson, Lesley Ugochukwu, Angelo and Diego Moreira in putting pen to paper on contracts at Stamford Bridge. A move for Disasi was accelerated after it was revealed that fellow defender Wesley Fofana had undergone surgery on an ACL injury which will keep him out for the majority of the coming campaign. Chelsea are well-stocked at centre-back, where Disasi\\'s former Monaco teammate Badiashile joins Thiago Silva, Levi Colwill and Trevoh Chalobah as available options for the coming campaign. Pochettino enjoyed an unbeaten pre-season and will return to Premier League action when Liverpool make the trip to London on 13 August.',\n",

After searching for a new goalkeeper to compete with Kepa Arrizabalaga, the Blues settled on Sanchez and quickly agreed a fee for the 25-year-old which 90min understands sits around the  £20m mark. Having passed his medical, Sanchez has put pen to paper on a seven-year contract to become Chelsea\\'s seventh signing of the summer. \"We   re very pleased to welcome Robert to Chelsea and he adds further quality to our goalkeeping unit,\" said sporting directors Laurence Stewart and Paul Winstanley, the latter of whom also joined from Brighton last summer. \"Robert has repeatedly proved himself in the Premier League and been capped by his country. We are excited to watch him work with Mauricio and his coaching team during the season ahead.\" feed Sanchez worked closely with Chelsea goalkeeping chief Ben Roberts, who was a coach under Graham Potter at both Brighton and Chelsea before being promoted to a more senior role at Stamford Bridge this summer. Chelsea\\'s current lead goalkeeping coach is Toni Jimenez, who joined as part of Mauricio Pochettino\\'s backroom staff. Sanchez leaves Brighton with 87 Premier League appearances to his name and it is that experience in England which has helped endear him to Chelsea\\'s recruitment team, who wanted an experience name to compete with Arrizabalaga. Thanks to his time in the Brighton academy, Sanchez also counts as a homegrown player in the Premier League, which comes as a boost to a Chelsea squad which has already bid farewell to Mason Mount and Ruben Loftus-Cheek this summer.',\n",

       "  'text': 'The agent of Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah has confirmed the Egyptian has no plans to listen to interest from Saudi Arabia. Rumours emerged over the weekend suggesting Salah was being lined up as the next superstar target of the Saudi Pro League, with champions Al Ittihad reported to have offered the 31-year-old a contract worth a cool  £155m. A  £52m transfer fee was also slated to be offered to Liverpool, who sold midfielder Fabinho to the same Saudi side earlier this window. In response, Salah\\'s agent has publicly confirmed there are no plans to leave Liverpool this summer. \"If we considered leaving LFC this year, we wouldn   t have renewed the contract last summer,\" Ramy Abbas Issa wrote on Twitter. \"Mohamed remains committed to LFC.\" If we considered leaving LFC this year, we wouldn   t have renewed the contract last summer. Mohamed remains committed to LFC. 90min understands there has been and remains interest from the Saudi Pro League in Salah. There have been enquiries, although the Liverpool star has primarily always been considered a target for 2024 or beyond, rather than necessarily this year. It means the matter isn\\'t likely to be closed. feed Salah, whose Liverpool contract still has two years left to run, has played plenty of minutes in pre-season, currently sits sixth on the Reds\\' all-time scoring charts and was recently tipped to climb even higher in the standings by current record holder Ian Rush. \"I speak a lot to Mo Salah,\" Rush told Prothom Alo. \"Mo keeps saying, \\'why did you score so many goals?\\'. He is thinking he might break my record. \"He would have to be there a good few more years if he is going to break that record. He plays a bit more of a wide role now. I don\\'t think he has scored as many goals but I think he made just as many assists this year. \"He has become more of a team player. A couple of years ago, he was maybe being a little selfish. But in the last two years, he has become more of a team player. And I think he is making just as many assists as he is scoring goals. \"Good luck to him. If he does it, he does it. I don\\'t care as long as he is winning things. There is no point doing that if you are not winning trophies. He can have that as long as they win a trophy.\"',\n",

       "  'text': \"The Premier League has firmly cemented itself as the financial powerhouse of both European and world football - at least until the Saudi Pro League started throwing ridiculous wages around. The spending power of the biggest clubs in England's top flight is almost unrivalled in Europe with even mid-to-lower table sides now on a par with many top teams in Italy, Germany and Spain. For that reason, the general trend of spending figures in Premier League transfer windows is only going up, even if it's not quite as simple as the final figure being higher year on year. Here are the six highest-spending Premier League transfer windows ever. That such a recent year is down in sixth place is due to the real effects of the Covid-19 pandemic that began to be felt by football clubs. Less so at Premier League level, of course, but it still existed.Major moves in this summer transfer window included Romelu Lukaku's return to Chelsea from Inter for  £103.5m, Jack Grealish's switch from Aston Villa to Manchester City for  £100m and Jadon Sancho's  £76.5m arrival at Manchester United from Borussia Dortmund. A big summer for a number of teams, Liverpool spent big to bring in Alisson for  £66.8m and Naby Keita for  £48m, as well as Fabinho for  £39m. Man City splashed out on Riyad Mahrez for  £60m from Leicester, while Chelsea paid  £71.6m for Kepa Arrizabalaga.Fred arrived at Man Utd for  £47m and there were also plenty of mid-level deals done by some of the smaller sides in the league, such as Richarlison's  £25m move to Everton. You may expect this transfer window to have been more depressed due to the Covid-19 pandemic but there was little knowledge at this stage about just how disrupted life was going to be over the next couple of years.For that reason, Premier League spending was around the sort of level that had become the norm in the few years prior. Chelsea spent  £222.5m in this window on players like Kai Havertz, Timo Werner and Ben Chilwell. Man City signed Ruben Dias for  £61m, while Liverpool forked out  £40m on Diogo Jota. This was a record-breaking year at the time and really made a lot of people sit up and realise just how much the Premier League was now able to spend.Mohamed Salah arrived at Liverpool, though only for a modest fee of  £34m, while Man Utd spent  £146m on Romelu Lukaku, Nemanja Matic and Victor Lindelof. Man City parted with  £211m on various players that included Ederson, Danilo, Kyle Walker and Bernardo Silva.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Pep Guardiola got in on a joke that has dogged Josko Gvardiol for years. \"What a beautiful surname he has,\" Manchester City\\'s manager grinned before confirming that the Croatian centre-back was undergoing a medical for the European and Premier League champions. Rather than an homage to the Catalan coach, Gvardiol\\'s last name is actually derived from the Latin verb \\'guardare\\', which fittingly translates as \\'to guard\\'. Gvardiol may only be 21 years of age but he has emerged as one of the most highly rated defenders in the world - a lofty billing that is reflected by the hefty fee City belatedly agreed with RB Leipzig this summer. Here\\'s how Gvardiol\\'s transfer to Manchester City compares to the most expensive players to ever guard their own team\\'s goal. Suits you, Josko!          pic.twitter.com/ySy5CfUAQ9 Manchester City\\'s Premier League rivals Chelsea were initially the front runners, failing with an approach for Gvardiol last summer before reigniting their interest in January. Real Madrid entered the race for the Golden Boy nominee, placing Gvardiol top of their centre-back targets in April as reported by 90min. However, Los Blancos have prioritised other areas of the pitch, notably midfield, while Chelsea opted to promote from within by handing the left-footed centre-back Levi Colwill a new six-year deal this summer. City\\'s intent has not shifted even if their patience has been tested. The reigning Premier League champions are no strangers to walking away from a deal which does not match their valuation - as they have previously demonstrated with Harry Maguire, Marc Cucurella and even Declan Rice this summer. At one point in July, RB Leipzig sporting director Max Eberl threatened to step back from negotiations as the clubs remained \"very far apart\". Talks between both parties were gummed up by the proposed fee. RB Leipzig were intent on making Gvardiol the most expensive defender in history, eclipsing the  £80m which Manchester United spent on Maguire in 2019. Finally, after months of painstaking negotiations, City appear to have won the battle of wills. Three days before Gvardiol was officially unveiled, 90min revealed that Leipzig had settled for an initial fee of  £77.5m (   90m). The final sum for Gvardiol may have just been shy of Maguire\\'s record, but where does he rank on the list of the game\\'s most expensive defenders ever? feed Player Year signed Selling club Buying club Fee Harry Maguire 2019 Leicester Man Utd  £80m Josko Gvardiol 2023 RB Leipzig Man City  £77.5m Virgil van Dijk 2018 Southampton Liverpool  £75m Wesley Fofana 2022 Leicester Chelsea  £75m Lucas Hernandez 2019 Atletico Madrid Bayern Munich  £68m Matthijs de Ligt 2019 Ajax Juventus  £68m Ruben Dias 2020 Benfica Man City  £62m Achraf Hakimi 2021 Inter PSG  £59m Matthijs de Ligt 2022 Juventus Bayern Munich  £59m Marc Cucurella 2022 Brighton Chelsea  £55m Gvardiol slots into second place on the all-time list of costly defenders, sandwiched between the hulking figures of Maguire and Virgil van Dijk. Liverpool briefly made Van Dijk the most expensive centre-back ever in January 2018, coughing up  £75m to Southampton. During the previous summer, Van Dijk was accused of going on strike to force through a move by his last Southampton manager Mauricio Pellegrino. The Saints stuck to their guns and kept the unhappy defender on their books for another six months, driving up the price from an initial  £60m. Unsurprisingly, given the financial clout that the Premier League wields, the four most expensive defenders of all time have been signed by English clubs. Wesley Fofana moved to Chelsea in the summer of 2022 for the same fee as Van Dijk but has come nowhere near the performances produced by the 2019 UEFA Men\\'s Player of the Year. Injury has routinely derailed Fofana\\'s integration in west London. After sitting out 20 games during his debut campaign, the luckless Frenchman ruptured his cruciate ligament in July.  Matthijs de Ligt has been repeatedly linked with a move to the Premier League but is yet to permanently journey across the Channel. The towering Dutch centre-back is the only defender that has ever commanded two separate transfer fees in excess of  £50m. At just 21, Gvardiol has plenty of time to make another expensive move but he has to guard the goal for Guardiola\\'s team first.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Tottenham have turned down Bayern Munich   s club record transfer bid for Harry Kane, sources have confirmed to 90min. Bayern have been keen on landing Kane ever since Robert Lewandowski joined Barcelona last summer. They had already seen two offers rejected by Tottenham earlier this summer, but left a recent meeting between club representatives feeling optimistic about a deal being struck, before then entering their third bid worth    100m ( £86m). That figure was both a record for Bayern, far exceeding what they paid for Lucas Hernandez in 2019, as well as Tottenham, who sold Gareth Bale to Real Madrid for  £85m in 2013. Despite Bayern wanting a quick decision from Spurs, the Premier League side took their time in relaying a response. 90min understands that the answer has been given and it remains    no   . Bayern had made it clear that it was their best and final offer, but are currently considering whether or not to return with a fourth proposal for the England captain. feed Although optimistic at the start of August, Bayern have also started to weigh up other options once more. One alternative is Juventus striker Dusan Vlahovic, who has already asked for a transfer this summer following a sub-par season in Serie A. Bayern have been in touch with his representatives, although Juventus have also been in touch with Chelsea regarding a Romelu Lukaku plus cash swap. Another striker Bayern have long kept an eye on is Randal Kolo Muani at Eintracht Frankfurt, the    100m ( £86m) asking price, despite matching the offer for Kane, is not something they want to pay. Rather, Paris Saint-Germain have emerged as favourites for France international Kolo Muani. Personal terms have already been agreed following talks over the weekend, with the club expected to follow suit and agree a transfer fee between them. PSG are also willing to offer Hugo Ekitike, whose loan from Reims was made permanent in June, in part-exchange.',\n",

After kicking off pre-season with victories over Leeds, Lyon and Arsenal, United have lost three on the bounce against Wrexham, Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund.

       "  'text': \"Barcelona midfielder Franck Kessie is closing in on a move to Saudi Pro League side Al Ahli, sources have confirmed to 90min. The Ivory Coast international only joined Barca from AC Milan on a free transfer last summer, and despite scoring a memorable last-minute winner against Real Madrid on their way to La Liga title glory, he was scarcely afforded extended chances at Camp Nou. 90min reported on Wednesday that Tottenham Hotspur had held talks with Barcelona over signing Kessie as well as teammate Clement Lenglet, who spent last season on loan in north London. But 90min understands that Spurs are again set to miss out on a long-term target in Kessie as he has agreed to join Saudi outfit Al Ahli. Barcelona had initially assumed that Kessie's preference was to remain in Europe, but they will now sit down to thrash out a    15m ( £13m) with Al Ahli, who have also signed Edouard Mendy, Roberto Firmino, Riyad Mahrez and Allan Saint-Maximin this transfer window. feed Crucially, Barcelona will not have to pay a portion of Kessie's wages in order to get him off their books, allowing them further flexibility under La Liga's strict financial restrictions. In addition to Tottenham, Juventus had also been eyeing Kessie and had made a tentative loan offer to Barcelona. The Bianconeri have since turned their attention back to Arsenal's Thomas Partey, but the Gunners'    46.5m ( £40m) price tag is proving prohibitive at this moment. Juve and other interested clubs could test Arsenal's resolve after the start of the 2023/24 season if he is not a guaranteed starter. With the departures of Kessie and Ousmane Dembele likely to be confirmed in the coming days, Barcelona are set to make a combined    65m ( £56m) in player sales for the duo and are now ramping up efforts to sign Joao Cancelo from Manchester City.\",\n",

With the two teams now simply finalising the last details of a transfer, Van de Ven is heading to England to undergo a medical ahead of signing a long-term contract at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.

       "  'text': 'FROM TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR STADIUM - The second peak of Harry Kane\\'s esteemed career coincided with Tottenham turning into a regressive and defensive team. From mid-2018 to the start of 2020, the striker became dogged by injuries, stripping him of a yard of pace and essentially pencilling him in for around ten games on the sidelines during any given season. By the time he effectively had back-to-back pre-seasons to reset his body during the pandemic, Spurs had fully committed to Jose Mourinho. Kane took on not only more of the scoring load alongside Son Heung-min, but also shouldered the creative burden. Through the Mourinho, Nuno Espirito Santo and Antonio Conte eras, Kane had to do everything in order to maintain Tottenham\\'s attacking potency. Enter Ange Postecoglou, a head coach drafted in to restore Spurs\\' long-forgotten attacking principles. Kane scored Spurs\\' first four in a 5-1 pre-season thrashing of Shakhtar Donetsk on Sunday as they flexed their new identity back on home soil. For the first time since the days of Mauricio Pochettino, Tottenham are looking to play on the front foot, to dominate the ball, to suffocate teams with possession and chances. When Kane was substituted towards the end of the match, he was met with a standing ovation, his iconic chant sung loudly from all four corners of the ground. Just as it had after each of his four goals, just as it had before a ball had even been kicked this afternoon. Today\\'s script may as well have been written by our new AI and ChatGPT overlords - once Kane was on the bench, a dark cloud emerged over the stadium. The heavens opened for five minutes before the sun began to reappear again. Heading into Sunday\\'s encounter, Spurs were continuing to mull over a new bid from Bayern Munich worth  £86m. It could well be their last in a saga which is nearing an end. If Tottenham choose to cash in on Kane, they stop any risk of him walking away for free next summer when his contract expires. It\\'s become clear that this is a risk they must take. Kane became the club\\'s all-time leading scorer back in February when he grabbed the only goal in a remarkable 1-0 victory at home to eventual treble-winners Manchester City. At full-time, he was celebrated and heralded for his remarkable achievements. That\\'s when it first sunk in - Tottenham Hotspur are Harry Kane, and Harry Kane is Tottenham Hotspur. manual If under-fire chairman Daniel Levy agrees to sell the club\\'s greatest ever player, he would tank his already negative approval rating to ungodly levels. If Kane walks for free, Spurs miss out on a hefty fee for the balance sheet, but at least he can say he kept the striker for all six years of his contract, tried his darnedest to extend that deal. It\\'s an incredibly rare feat for an academy graduate to become the face and soul of their boyhood club, especially in the super-club age. Tottenham should cherish this as long as they possibly can, kick the replacement striker can down the road for another year at least. If building a billion-pound stadium was meant to bridge the gap to the elite in the transfer market, it should also be able to absolve such a financial loss. There is, also, the Postecoglou factor. Kane scored 30 Premier League goals last season, his joint-best total despite sorry Spurs limping to an eighth place finish. In theory, he would be able to rival Erling Haaland for the Golden Boot in a team which creates bucketloads of chances rather than being drip-fed them. \"He\\'s a fantastic striker, one of the world\\'s best. I think the way the team plays will help him as well. He loves scoring goals and you saw today we created a load of chances and he was the beneficiary of that,\" Postecoglou said on Sunday. Tottenham still believe they could yet convince Kane to sign a new contract. This is more of a last chance than a last dance. The cruel world of modern football needs both to go through with it.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Brighton & Hove Albion have agreed a club record transfer fee with Ajax for Ghana forward Mohammed Kudus, sources have confirmed to 90min. Brighton have been tracking Kudus all summer, as 90min has already revealed, and now they have pushed ahead and finalised the terms of a deal with Ajax.  The Seagulls have met Ajax's asking price of    40m ( £34.5m) and that would surpass their existing club record move set earlier this summer when Joao Pedro completed his move from Watford. Kudus has now been given the green light to agree personal terms with Brighton, a detail that has not yet been finalised. Brighton are working hard to persuade him that moving to AMEX Stadium is his best next step, with manager Roberto De Zerbi convinced that the Ghanaian is an ideal signing. feed As 90min has previously revealed, Kudus has been targeted by Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester United in recent months - all have reached out to his representatives this summer and hold an interest. But none of them have made firm offers at this point, leaving Brighton in pole position to complete a deal. Kudus is currently in Germany with Ajax ahead of their pre-season clash with Borussia Dortmund on Sunday afternoon, but it remains to be seen if he will feature.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Pep Guardiola has challenged both Barcelona and Bayern Munich to make better offers for Bernardo Silva and Kyle Walker as the Manchester City manager prepares for a battle to keep hold of both players. The two City stars have been approached over summer exits but Guardiola does not want to weaken his squad any further, having already lost both Ilkay Gundogan and Riyad Mahrez during this transfer window. While Guardiola has long insisted he will not block any unhappy player from leaving, he warned both Barca and Bayern that City will not simply hand their players away for cheap. \"I don\\'t want any players who don\\'t want to be here but I\\'m an employee. I want to work with guys who want to stay and work with staff and players, but after we have to get a proper offer,\" Guardiola explained. \"If we don\\'t get a proper offer, he\\'s our player and we want him. If they want him, they will take a plane and come here and talk to our sporting director and CEO to make an agreement because three parts have to be there. \"For us to buy a player, just because we are Man City it is  £10-15m more expensive than other clubs all the time. If people want our really really important players, first they have to make an offer - and that hasn\\'t happened. When it happens, we will fight to extend the contract and be with us. That has happened with all of our players since day one.\" feed Guardiola went on to stress that the challenge of replacing two undisputed starters on a treble-winning side would be a costly operation and so those players will only be sold for substantial offers. \"When you win the Treble, it looks like the job is done. Players who are 32, 33 like Ilkay and Riyad say we arrived here for Premier Leagues and then people ask about the Champions League,\" he continued. \"Some players feel they want a new experience. I will not be the guy who says no - but they have to make an agreement with the important part of the club, the business. Make a deal and it happens. \"In the case of Bernardo and Kyle, we talk many times over the last months and even years how important they are, how we want them and we will continue to do so until the end. I don\\'t know what will happen but it won\\'t happen if the clubs don\\'t arrive because they are massively important players. \"When we lose those players we have to go to the market for the replacements and these players and they cost more than  £50m. We need that money to reimburse on other players to make the team as strong as possible to defend the crowns that we won and win games for our people.\"',\n",

       "  'text': \"Bayern Munich have drawn up a list of alternative options to Harry Kane in case their club record bid for the striker is rejected, 90min understands.  Sources confirmed to 90min last week that Bayern Munich had made a club record  £86m (   100m) bid to sign Tottenham talisman Kane this summer, having previously seen two offers rejected by Daniel Levy and co. in recent weeks.  As things stand, the Bundesliga holders are yet to receive a response from Tottenham regarding their most recent offer and have had no indication that it will be accepted.  Due to this uncertainty, Bayern officials have opted to draw up a list of alternative targets if a deal to sign Kane does not materliase.  feed 90min understands that one such alternative target is Dusan Vlahovic of Juventus. The forward asked to leave Juve in June - a request that was given its blessing by manager Massimiliano Allegri - following a disappointing 2022/23 campaign in Turin in which he managed just 10 Serie A goals.  Bayern have now made contact with Vlahovic's representatives in order to check in on the player's current situation at Juventus. 90min recently reported that Vlahovic's current employers have made attempts to get rid of the forward this summer already. The club has proposed a swap deal with Chelsea that would see the Serbian move to Stamford Bridge in exchange for Romelu Lukaku plus cash.  While Chelsea have held talks with Vlahovic's camp, they are not keen on the aforementioned deal as they are not interested in paying a fee in additiona to parting with Lukaku to get the forward.  Another striker that Bayern have shortlisted is France international and Eintracht Frankfurt star Randal Kolo Muani. The emerging talent has been linked with Bayern earlier this year, however 90min understands that Frankfurt's asking price of  £86m is not a fee that the club would be willing to pay.  Paris Saint-Germain are currently favourite to sign Kolo Muani, with the player already agreeing personal terms after talks accelerated over the weekend. Sources have confirmed to 90min that a deal is also likely to be agreed between the clubs soon, and a significant reason for that is PSG being willing offer Hugo Ekitike in part-exchange.  Kolo Muani is seen by PSG as an ideal replacement for Kylian Mbappe in plans for life without their superstar forward due to his current contract situation and desire to join Real Madrid. \",\n",

A fee of around  £35m, plus a further  £5m in add-ons, has been paid by Newcastle, with around 40% of that sum heading to Livramento\\'s boyhood club Chelsea as a result of a sell-on clause included in his 2021 switch to St Mary\\'s Stadium.

       "  'text': 'Brighton & Hove Albion have made it clear to Moises Caicedo that he will not be sold unless their  £100m valuation of him is met, sources have confirmed to 90min. The Ecuador international is continuing to be courted by Chelsea, who have already seen two bids - the first worth  £70m and the second worth  £80m - knocked back by the Seagulls. 90min understands that Caicedo has confirmed his desire to leave Brighton on several occasions this summer. The club are keen to avoid him making his agitations public and so have decided to communicate why they are not entertaining Chelsea\\'s most recent offers. Brighton value Caicedo at a similar amount to Declan Rice, who recently signed for Arsenal from West Ham United for a British-record  £105m transfer fee, and this has been explained to the player and his representatives. Chelsea remain undeterred in their pursuit of Caicedo and will continue their advances. They have already agreed a deal to sign Robert Sanchez from Brighton this window and the clubs are on good terms despite their ongoing grievances over Caicedo and Levi Colwill, who put pen to paper on a new six-year contract at Stamford Bridge this week. feed When quizzed about Caicedo ahead of their pre-season friendly with Chelsea in the United States last month, Brighton head coach Roberto De Zerbi insisted the midfielder is going nowhere anytime soon and poked fun at the Blues\\' inability to qualify for Europe. \"It\\'s a clear situation at the moment. [Caicedo] stays with us until my owner changes his mind,\" De Zerbi said. \"I don\\'t know what can happen in the future, but if Moises leaves we have to find the right player because it\\'s difficult to replace a player as good as Moises. We have to substitute him with a great player because this year we play in the Europa League unlike Chelsea.\"',\n",

       "  'text': \"A year is an awful long time in football, and that has certainly proved the case for Folarin Balogun.  This time last year, few would have known too much about the young Arsenal striker, but following an impressive loan spell with Stade Reims in Ligue 1, the 22-year-old is now one of the most exciting young forwards in Europe and a USMNT international. Scoring 22 goals in 39 games for Reims last season, he is now being targeted by a number of top clubs. However, 90min understands that Arsenal value Balogun at  £50m, which may put off some potential suitors. The Gunners have told Balogun he can find a new club with no obvious route into the first team as Gabriel Jesus, Eddie Nketiah and new signing Kai Havertz stand in his path. There will be many clubs knocking on his agent's door this summer, but where he will end up is still unclear. feed Having come within 90 minutes of Champions League glory last season, things promise to be more complicated for Inter this term. Andre Onana, Marcelo Brozovic, Edin Dzeko and Romelu Lukaku will not be at the club next season as Simone Inzaghi is responsible for something of a rebuild in key areas this summer. One position that needs strengthening in the window is up front. Having brought in Marcus Thuram on a free transfer to help Lautaro Martinez, Inzaghi is keen to reinforce his attacking unit further having lost two key centre-forward options. Balogun is one of the players Inter have been in contact with over a potential move to San Siro. More similar in profile to Martinez than Thuram, Balogun could offer depth and quality in attack. The forward has huge potential and could develop further in Serie A under Inzaghi's tutelage, but that  £50m fee would likely be unworkable for Inter. Considering West Ham are the only Premier League club yet to make a signing this window, David Moyes would probably be thankful to get anybody through the door at the London Stadium. The  £105m departure of Declan Rice means the Hammers have a huge budget to work with, but they have still been unable to get any deals done. Atalanta, who are a club linked with Balogun themselves, have agreed a deal for Irons forward Gianluca Scamacca after an unsuccessful stint with West Ham. Not only will this add another  £26m to available funds, it will free up a space up front that needs filling. Balogun could be the man to fill the gap, posing a completely different skillset to the departing Scamacca. Balogun's pace and nous for finding space in the penalty area could make him a prime target to add more goals to a sometimes blunt West Ham side. A return to Ligue 1 could be on the cards for Balogun, who would certainly need no time in readjusting to life in France. Lille finished fifth last season and qualified for the Europa Conference League, but would likely find it difficult to raise the required funds to prise Balogun away from north London. Paulo Fonseca's side have lost a couple of forward players in Timothy Weah and Jonathan Bamba this summer and need greater depth in attacking areas. Balogun, however, may be too far out of their price range. Jordan Ayew, Odsonne Edouard and Jean-Philippe Mateta are hardly the most awe-inspiring attacking trio in the Premier League. The three strikers have all struggled for consistency since arriving at Selhurst Park, and with Wilfried Zaha's exit, Palace need more goals next year. Michael Olise's potential departure would only exacerbate this issue, but Balogun could be the solution. The 22-year-old's ability to run in behind opposition defences makes him a completely different proposition to the Eagles' current centre-forward options. Similarly to Lille, however, Palace would be unlikely to splash  £50m on untested Premier League player, knowing a better could be found deal somewhere else in Europe. Ivan Toney scored 20 goals in 33 Premier League games last season but will not be available to Brentford until January 2024 following a ban for breaching betting rules. While Bryan Mbuemo, Kevin Schade, and Yoane Wissa are all capable of providing goals for the Bees next year, they won't be able to offer the same consistency as Toney. Balogun showcased his ability to score weekly for Reims last season, although doing it in the Premier League is admittedly a different proposition.  Balogun is also a different profile striker to Toney and is not quite as adept at holding the ball up and winning physical battles. Given Brentford just spent around  £20m on Schade following his move from Freiburg, they may not be in a position to spend big on Balogun.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Arsenal do not expect midfielder Jorginho to leave before the end of the summer transfer window despite rumoured interest from Fenerbahce. The Gunners recruited the Italy international back in January and he has since courted maintained interest from Serie A sides Lazio and Juventus. While a good offer would be enough for Arsenal to sell Jorginho - much like teammate Thomas Partey's current situation - 90min understands he isn't in talks with Turkish side Fenerbahce and an exit is not currently on the cards. Arsenal are preparing to let goalkeeper Matt Turner depart after agreeing an  £8m deal with Nottingham Forest for the USMNT international. Turner joined Arsenal in 2022 as back-up to Aaron Ramsdale and featured at the 2022 World Cup with the United States. Forest used Dean Henderson and Keylor Navas as goalies last season. Steve Cooper's side still like Manchester United's Henderson, but their preference for a loan deal due to his injury record differs to United favouring a permanent move. Roma defender Roger Ibanez was also a target for Forest, with talks over a    30m deal being held, but he has instead elected to join Saudi Pro League side Al Ahli. Napoli midfielder Piotr Zielinski is another player who will soon seal a move to the Middle East. Poland international Zielinski, who was a key figure in his side's historic Serie A title win last season, will soon confirm his move to Al Ahli, where Roberto Firmino, Allan Saint-Maximin and Edouard Mendy have all relocated this summer. Napoli are targeting Teun Koopmeiners and Gabri Veiga as potential replacements. Atalanta aren't looking to sell Koopmeiners for any less than    50m, while a    30m offer for Veiga was rejected by Celta Vigo. Paris Saint-Germain have agreed personal terms with Eintracht Frankfurt striker Randal Kolo Muani and a deal is close to completion. PSG see Kolo Muani as their ideal replacement for Kylian Mbappe and talks accelerated over the weekend. Youngster Hugo Ekitike was offered during negotiations, a player Frankfurt are appreciative of. The Ligue 1 champions are still tracking Joao Felix's situation, though favour a loan deal which they could pursue towards the end of the month. The Portugal forward also has an offer from Al Ahli but wants to stay in Europe. feed Burnley are ready to seize on Sheffield United's instability by pursuing a deal for Norwegian midfielder Sander Berge. The Blades have already lost Iliman Ndiaye this month and are ready to sell their other star midfielder to the Clarets. Berge only has a year left on his contract and has turned down fresh advances from United. Should a deal be agreed, Berge will still need to come through a medical, having seen a switch to Fulham in January fall through because of a knock. Burnley are also keen to wrap up a deal for Ajax striker Mohamed Daramy but face competition from Reims, who have entered the bidding late on in their search for a replacement for Folarin Balogun. Crystal Palace are in talks with Bayer Leverkusen over a loan move for centre-back Odilon Kossounou. Palace are looking to add to their options in central defence where Marc Guehi and Joachim Andersen have impressed and a deal with a    25m obligation to buy has been put forward. Leverkusen have also been in contact with Tottenham all summer over the future of fellow defender Edmond Tapsoba.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Chelsea have contacted the representatives of USA midfielder Tyler Adams over a possible move to Stamford Bridge, 90min understands. Adams played for the USMNT at the 2022 World Cup and was relegated with Leeds in his first season in the Premier League having joined from RB Leipzig for  £15m. Adams suffered a hamstring injury in March and didn't add to his 24 league appearances thereafter. Leeds accepted they would likely lose Adams and international teammate Brenden Aaronson following their relegation to the Championship. Aaronson has since joined Union Berlin on loan, while Adams previously attracted interest from Newcastle. Sources have confirmed to 90min that Chelsea have now enquired over his availability. Adams has a release worth around  £25m and the Blues believe the midfielder would slot in well in west London. Leeds expect the 24-year-old to leave Elland Road by the end of the month, with Chelsea not the only Premier League side interested. Tottenham, Liverpool, Manchester United, Brighton and Brentford are all keeping tabs on the situation. feed Adams was in attendance for Leeds' opening Championship game of the season against Cardiff on Sunday as his side rescued a 2-2 draw thanks to goals from Liam Cooper and Crysencio Summerville. Chelsea have signed exciting talent like Nicolas Jackson and Christopher Nkunku so far this window but are light in midfield after the departures of Mason Mount, N'Golo Kante and Ruben Loftus-Cheek. Rennes star Lesley Ugochukwu has recently joined the options at Mauricio Pochettino's disposal which include Enzo Fernandez, Conor Gallagher and Andrey Santos. Moises Caicedo is a high-profile target for Pochettino and Todd Boehly but no agreement with Brighton has been reached. The Ecuador international has a price tag of  £100m and missed the Seagulls' final pre-season friendly of the summer against Rayo Vallecano on Sunday.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"West Ham United have agreed to sell Gianluca Scamacca to Atalanta in a deal worth    30m ( £26m), sources have confirmed to 90min. The 24-year-old was one of the Hammers' marquee signings last summer, alongside Lucas Paqueta, but it was quickly apparent that a change in playing style would be needed to get the best out of the Italian. Injury complaints didn't help Scamacca in trying to settle in London, and he was unable to command a regular starting spot despite costing David Moyes and West Ham in excess of  £30m when joining from Sassuolo. Scamacca scored eight goals in all competitions from 27 appearances, but crucially netted just three times in the Premier League for West Ham, who laboured to 20 defeats from their 38 league games but did end their 43-year trophy drought by winning the Conference League. 90min revealed in early June that Roma had shown an interest in taking Scamacca back to Serie A, with the player showing a desire to return to his homeland. Jose Mourinho's side were unable to fund a permanent deal, however, and were instead looking to conclude a loan with option or obligation to buy. Inter also made a bid for Scamacca but sources have confirmed to 90min it's Atalanta who have agreed a deal with West Ham. feed Last season's Europa League quarter-finalists will pay a guaranteed    25m ( £21.6m) for Scamacca, with a further    5m in achievable add-ons included into the deal, and are set to partner him up with AC Milan's Charles De Ketelaere, who is nearing a loan move with option to buy. 90min understands that Scamacca is already en route to complete a medical, ending his stay in east London after just a year of the five he committed to little over 12 months ago. Scamacca's exit is another blow to a West Ham side who are yet to make a senior signing this summer - they are the only Premier League club who haven't - amid disagreements between Moyes and new technical director Tim Steidten over how to replace Declan Rice, who joined Arsenal earlier this summer in a British-record  £105m deal. West Ham are also yet to appoint a new club captain, even though the new Premier League season gets underway in six days when newly-promoted Burnley take on Manchester City.\",\n",

The Blues have not been afraid to splash the cash in the second summer under BlueCo, whose acquisition of Ligue 1 side Strasbourg has seen them step up their pursuits of a number of young talents who could hone their craft in France. There are hopes to use Strasbourg to finally get a deal for Russian starlet Arsen Zakharyan over the line, while Montpellier striker Elye Wahi could be loaned to the French side if a deal can be struck with his current employers. A decision must be made on new midfielder recruit Lesley Ugochukwu and Brazilian winger Angelo, who joined from Santos earlier this summer, has also been tipped for a move to Strasbourg. Sources have confirmed to 90min that Chelsea have once again returned to Santos with an offer for 18-year-old Washington. feed A bid of an initial  £13m, plus a further  £4m in add-ons, has been lodged by the Blues, who are trying to negotiate a discount on Santos'  £26m asking price. Clubs across Europe have been following Washington, with Monaco ready to match Chelsea's  £15m bid if it is accepted, but the Stamford Bridge outfit are working to win the race for his signature and could loan the teenager to Strasbourg if a deal is struck. Ligue 1 rules mean Chelsea can loan just three players out to Strasbourg, who must also adhere to the rule of having no more than four non-EU players on their books, so alternative strategies will have to be taken for some of these proposed loans. Washington has managed 16 senior appearances for Santos and has scored two goals, both of which came in consecutive outings in May.\",\n",

England captain Kane has been Bayern's top transfer target all summer and the two clubs recently met for talks in London.

Thomas Tuchel's side are unlikely to return with a higher bid if Tottenham are left unsatisfied with the third offer. Bayern do, however, want a decision over the sale to be made quickly by Spurs. Tottenham have been confident throughout the summer of keeping the 30-year-old even though his deal expires next year. The north London side remain hopeful Kane will sign a new contract and plan to work on fresh terms during Ange Postecoglou's first season in charge. feed Spurs informed Kane at the start of the transfer window they had no plans to sell him, with Manchester United, Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain among the European heavyweights eyeing a move.

       "  'text': 'Tottenham Hotspur have confirmed the signing of Alejo Veliz from Rosario Central, subject to international clearance and a work permit. The 19-year-old has put pen to paper on a contract until 2029 and becomes Spurs\\' seventh permanent addition of a busy summer transfer window. The club announced the arrival of Micky van de Ven from Wolfsburg earlier on Tuesday. \"It\\'s like I\\'m touching the heavens,\" Veliz said during his announcement video. feed Veliz will take the number 36 shirt and joins Tottenham for a  £13m fee. 90min reported last week that Spurs were going to win the race for the highly-rated striker, with AC Milan, AS Roma, Nottingham Forest, and Salernitana also interested in his signature. While Veliz arrives to bolster Spurs\\' attacking options, his arrival is unlikely to have much bearing on the future of Harry Kane. 90min understands that Kane will stay put in north London for the 2023/24 season if a move away does not transpire before the new Premier League campaign begins this weekend. Bayern Munich have had three Kane bids rejected by Tottenham and are contemplating making a fourth, while the German champions are also beginning to look at alternate options.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Liverpool have had a third offer for Romeo Lavia worth  £45m rejected by Southampton, sources have confirmed to 90min. The 19-year-old has been attracting the interest of Chelsea and Arsenal for the best part of a year, but Liverpool have shot to the front of the queue of interested parties after allowing central midfield duo Jordan Henderson and Fabinho to head to the riches of Saudi Arabia. The Reds saw an opening offer of  £35m immediately rejected by recently-relegated Southampton, before an improved bid for Lavia worth  £42m was also rebuffed. Southampton have maintained throughout negotiations that they want at least  £50m for Lavia, and 90min understands they have held their ground after receiving a third Liverpool offer, worth  £45m in total. Liverpool remain keen to tie up a deal for Lavia and crucially have not walked away from negotiations - indicating that they may be willing to raise their offer once more in order to get a deal over the line. feed Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai have already arrived at Anfield this summer, from Brighton and RB Leipzig respectively, but there's an appetite for Liverpool to conclude further business in a bid to get back into the Premier League title mix. Jurgen Klopp has seen not only Henderson and Fabinho depart, but also Naby Keita, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and James Milner from the midfield ranks - Lavia's potential arrival an indication of a changing of the guard on Merseyside. Fluminense's Andre Trindade is regarded as a viable alternative to Lavia, should Liverpool not be able to iron things out with Southampton, while the club may also look to sign a centre-back before the summer window slams shut.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Chelsea are expected to agree to the loan departures of both Lewis Hall and Cesare Casadei, 90min understands, with talks underway over both players' next moves. Hall, 18, made his breakthrough into the senior side last season, seeing a number of appearances at left-back under Frank Lampard despite most of his academy training coming as a central midfielder. Chelsea have plenty of competition for minutes at left-back, with Ian Maatsen's sensational loan with Burnley seeing him kept in a squad which already includes both Ben Chilwell and Marc Cucurella, and now 90min understands a loan move is on the cards for Hall. Talks are on with Crystal Palace, who are looking to sign Hall on a loan deal which would not include a purchase clause. Chelsea are huge believers in Hall, who has three years remaining on his contract, and want to see the teenager back at Stamford Bridge next summer. The negotiations over Hall are being kept separate from those involving Palace's Michael Olise, for whom Chelsea are confident of getting a deal over the line. feed Hall is expected to be followed out of the door by 20-year-old Casadei who, after six months on loan with Reading last season, is set to get his next taste of senior football with Leicester City. Chelsea had hoped to find a top-flight suitor for Casadei, whose meteoric rise to prominence continued with a stunning Under-20 World Cup campaign this summer, but believe the chance to work under new Foxes boss Enzo Maresca towards the top of the Championship could be beneficial for the Italian. Both players were given a handful of opportunities under new manager Mauricio Pochettino during pre-season but the Blues' bloated squad means there is significant competition for minutes and so the decisions have been taken to look for loan moves. Chelsea will also decide on the futures of fellow young midfielders Andrey Santos and Carney Chukwuemeka, both of whom saw plenty of minutes in pre-season.\",\n",

Mbappe has been made available for transfer this summer after declining to trigger the extension in his current Paris Saint-Germain contract, which now expires next summer. Real Madrid are long-term admirers of Mbappe and are planning to secure the Frenchman\\'s signature either this summer or next year on a free transfer, while PSG have attempted to drum up interest from elsewhere to ensure they do not lost their talisman for nothing.  A world record bid from Al Hilal was accepted by the club but rejected by Mbappe himself, while Premier League sides like Chelsea have been contacted but are not confident of convincing the Frenchman, whose focus remains on Madrid. While an official offer from Madrid is yet to arrive, a number of players have taken the opportunity to fuel the speculation, with winger Rodrygo posting a picture alongside Mbappe last week with no caption. feed Now, Vinicius and Militao have continued to tease fans after a video emerged (via GOAL) with the duo telling chief scout Calafat: \"We hope [Mbappe] will come. Juni has to sign him.\" Calafat responded to the duo, joking: \"You are spending all our money in Ibiza. We   ll no longer have enough for Mbappe.\" PSG have returned to France to finalise their preparations for the upcoming Ligue 1 season and face a decision over what to do with Mbappe, who has been training with a group of transfer-listed players and has not yet worked under new manager Luis Enrique. The Parisians will get their season underway on Saturday when they welcome Lorient to Parc des Princes.',\n",

Sources have confirmed to 90min that an agreement has been reached in principle over a deal worth  £34m, with the Mexico international one of West Ham's top targets to replace Declan Rice. The Hammers have endured a frustrating transfer window so far, amid clashes between manager David Moyes and technical director Tim Steidten over targets, and have seen bids for Joao Palhinha, Conor Gallagher and James Ward-Prowse turned down. Manchester United's Scott McTominay has also been on the radar, but Alvarez, alongside Monaco's Youssouf Fofana, is a player that Steidten has been pushing for West Ham to sign. 90min revealed on Sunday that talks were ongoing with Dutch giants Ajax over a fee for Alvarez, who has long indicated his desire to move to the Premier League, and sources have now confirmed that an agreement has been reached over a deal that could eventually be worth  £34m. Alvarez was close to joining Borussia Dortmund earlier this summer but a deal to move to the Bundesliga runners-up fell through at the 11th hour. feed 26-year-old Alvarez has also been on the radar of Manchester United and Chelsea over the past 12 months, though both clubs have moved on to secure other targets and their interest has subsequently cooled. West Ham hope that Alvarez, who is expected to sign a long-term contract barring any last minute complications, will be the first of up to half a dozen new signings at London Stadium. The club are gearing up to compete in the Europa League after winning last season's Conference League, but haven't added to their squad yet and have seen captain Rice leave for Arsenal in a British-record  £105m deal. Another central midfield arrival is high up on West Ham's transfer agenda, while they would also like to sign a new central defender, left back and centre forward as a minimum - the need for the latter highlighted further by the club agreeing to send Gianluca Scamacca back to Italy just 12 months into a five-year deal. Atalanta confirmed his arrival from West Ham in a deal worth  £26m on Monday, allowing the Premier League side to recoup the majority of the money they paid Sassuolo in July 2022.\",\n",

Brentford have made it clear all summer that they are prepared to sell Raya, who is in the final year of his contract, for  £40m - an asking price which scared off Tottenham before they signed Guglielmo Vicario instead. After expressing an interest in Raya earlier this week, Arsenal have now opened the bidding with an offer which 90min understands is closer to half of Brentford's asking price. An initial  £20m has been proposed, with Arsenal also prepared to pay up to  £5m in potential add-ons. Brentford are expected to reject the offer as they stand firm on their asking price. Manager Thomas Frank recently insisted  £40m is cheap for Raya, pointing to Arsenal's decision to sign another player in the final year of their contract, Declan Rice, for  £105m. feed Arsenal are not alone in their pursuit of Raya, with German giants Bayern Munich also keen on the Spaniard as they seek to replace Yann Sommer, who is expected to join Inter. Sommer has acted as cover for the injured Manuel Neuer after the German broke his leg following the conclusion of the World Cup but is expected to leave this summer and Bayern are keen to move for Raya, although Brentford's asking price continues to prove problematic. Raya himself confessed earlier this summer that he feared Brentford's  £40m demand would price him out of a transfer, although the 27-year-old vowed to respect his club's decision and remain focused on the job if he is not granted an exit. As for Brentford, they have already signed a replacement for Raya, striking a deal to recruit Dutch international Mark Flekken from Freiburg last month.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Roberto De Zerbi admits he\\'s unsure what the future holds for midfielder Moises Caicedo but says Brighton will sign \"another important player\" if he leaves. Chelsea have seen several bids rejected by Brighton, the latest of which was worth  £80m. The Seagulls want  £100m to sell their star midfielder and recently made it clear to Caicedo why they are holding out for such a fee. Amid the uncertainty, Caicedo was left out of Brighton\\'s final friendly on Sunday - a decision which chief executive Paul Barber publicly claimed was down to injury. \"Moises had a slight hamstring injury late in training and was pulled out for that reason,\" Barber told Brighton media. \"With a Premier League season just a week away it makes no sense to risk him today. We   re looking forward to Moises starting the season with us, he   s a Brighton player under a long-term contract.\" feed After the game, De Zerbi kept the focus on the transfer uncertainty surrounding Caicedo, confessing he did not know when he would see the Ecuador international again. \"I don   t know [if he\\'ll be back in training tomorrow],\" he said. \"If Moises leaves, we will find another important player. And if Moises stays, I will be happy for us, for the team, for the club. But it   s not my problem now. If Moises leaves, we will bring another player in. \"We are Brighton, and under our policy there is the possibility to lose some players at the end of the season. It was the same for [Alexis] Mac Allister and [Levi] Colwill.\" 90min understands that Chelsea are expected to return with an increased offer for Caicedo, but have been searching for alternative targets amid concerns over the price tag.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Barcelona have made fresh contact with Manchester City\\'s Bernardo Silva, confirming their ongoing work behind the scenes to put together a deal to sign him, sources have confirmed to 90min. City have already informed Silva and his entourage that they do no want to sell him this summer and have outlined their plans to make him one of the highest paid players at the club alongside Kevin De Bruyne and Erling Haaland. However, with Barca\\'s interest reigniting, 90min understands Silva has again made it clear to City and Guardiola that he would like to leave the club - the Portuguese international said the same 12 months ago but was asked to stay for another season, at which point the Premier League champions would look at letting him leave as long as their valuation of around  £80m was met. But the departures of Riyad Mahrez and Ilkay Gundogan have seen City change their stance on Silva and now insist they can\\'t afford to let him leave, even if a club agree to meet the valuation - something Ligue 1 giants Paris Saint-Germain have already indicated they would be willing to do. Now Barca, who are set to pocket nearly  £60m from the sales of Ousmane Dembele and Franck Kessie, are trying to package together a deal that will convince City to let Silva go, having previously thought a deal was unattainable because of their precarious finances. feed Barca are also locked in talks with City over the future of Joao Cancelo, who has agreed personal terms, and they hope they can come to agreement that will take both Portugal internationals to Catalonia this summer - but sources have told 90min that as it stands City will not sell. Speaking after City\\'s Community Shield defeat to Arsenal, which featured Silva from the start, manager Pep Guardiola was asked about his future and also that of Bayern Munich target Kyle Walker, who also featured at Wembley.    He   s [Walker] super important for us. Hopefully he can stay. We have one more year of contract, it\\'s not the end so if someone wants him they have to talk, like Bernardo Silva. We want them to stay. They are so important for us,\" the Spaniard said.',\n",

       "  'text': \"West Ham United have made a second bid for former Manchester United captain Harry Maguire, sources have confirmed to 90min. The Hammers are looking to strengthen their squad with as many as six signings before the transfer window closes, but have only signed Cliftonville youngster Sean Moore to date. The club is yet to splash any of the immediate cash received from Declan Rice's  £105m British-record move to Arsenal. A deal for Ajax midfielder Edson Alvarez is nearing completion after a fee was agreed and West Ham have now returned with another offer for Maguire after an initial approach was knocked back at the end of July. Sources have confirmed to 90min that West Ham's new bid is worth  £30m, though any deal, should United decide the fee is enough, is likely to hinge on the 13-time Premier League winners continuing to contribute towards Maguire's hefty wages. United manager Erik ten Hag has established Raphael Varane and Lisandro Martinez as his first-choice centre-back duo at Old Trafford, with Victor Lindelof and Luke Shaw, naturally a left-back, also ahead of Maguire in the pecking order for places. feed Maguire has also been stripped of the club captaincy this summer, in favour of appointing Bruno Fernandes, and United are willing to sanction his exit if they receive an offer that they believe reflects his market value - they paid Leicester  £80m for his services in 2019. West Ham are continuing to show interest in Maguire's United team-mate Scott McTominay, sources have further confirmed to 90min. An offer of  £30m has been made by the Hammers for the 26-year-old Scot and talks are ongoing between the two clubs over a potential deal. The Hammers have returned to McTominay after deciding against pursuing Southampton's James Ward-Prowse. However, neither Maguire nor McTominay are itching to leave Old Trafford, with both players hopeful of featuring in the new season. Monaco's Youssouf Fofana is another player front and centre of technical director Tim Steidten's transfer plans, with West Ham also wanting to sign a left-back and striker before the window closes on September 1.\",\n",

After lengthy negotiations with Atalanta, United have agreed to a deal which will see them part with a guaranteed    75m ( £64m, $82.3m), with a further    10m ( £8.6m, $11m) in potential add-ons, to sign the 20-year-old striker.

       "  'text': 'Fabinho\\'s transfer to Saudi Pro League champions Al Ittihad has been confirmed, bringing the Brazil international\\'s five-season stay at Anfield to an end. The midfielder was a crucial starting XI member under Jurgen Klopp during memorable Champions League and Premier League successes but now joins Nuno Espirito Santo\\'s side who have also recruited Karim Benzema, N\\'Golo Kante and Jota this summer. There were concerns the move could fall through due to issues relating to the proposed payment structure, but the deadlock was soon broken and Fabinho underwent a medical. A statement from Liverpool ends: \"Everyone at Liverpool FC would like to thank Fabinho for all of his contributions to the club\\'s successes during the last five years.\" Fabinho becomes the second Liverpool midfielder to seal a move to the Saudi Pro League after former club captain Jordan Henderson left Anfield to reunite with old teammate Steven Gerrard at Al Ettifaq. feed The former Monaco star made 219 appearances in total for the Reds after moving to Anfield in 2018, scoring 11 goals. As well as the Champions League and Premier League successes, Fabinho also won both the FA Cup and Carabao Cup during the 2021/22 campaign. The midfielder was picked out for criticism as Liverpool struggled to mount a challenge for Champions League qualification in 2022/23, leading the Reds to strengthen central areas early in the summer transfer window. Alex Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai have been brought in from Brighton and RB Leipzig respectively, while long-time squad members James Milner, Naby Keita, Roberto Firmino and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain have all departed.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Sadio Mane's proposed transfer to Al Nassr in Saudi Arabia is set to see former club Liverpool miss out on a chunk of extra income. The deal agreed between Liverpool and Bayern Munich for Mane last summer started at around  £27.5m in a guaranteed transfer fee. But the overall package was inflated by  £7.5m worth of add-ons that were dependent on the player hitting certain targets in Bavaria. Such performance-based add-ons can often include things like appearances or goals. But Mane didn't have a particularly good debut season with Bayern, playing only 25 times in the Bundesliga, scoring just nine league goals and generally underperforming. manual At one stage, Mane was internally suspended by Bayern and fined a club record amount for lashing out at teammate Leroy Sane, with coach Thomas Tuchel eventually concluding that the Senegal international had fallen 'short of expectations'. Now that he is set to move on from Bayern to join Al Nassr, the Daily Mail has reported it will cost Liverpool. The various add-ons in the 2022 transfer agreement didn't end up being triggered and are set to be lost as soon as the player has a new club. Liverpool would have been hopefully of those add-ons being achievable, yet now won't see that additional money coming in. Mane was initially resistant of a switch to the Saudi Pro League. As 90min reported at the time, Al Ettifaq were the team initially interested in signing the 31-year-old. However, not long after making clear his intention not to engage with talks, Mane agreed personal terms with Al Nassr in principle.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Newcastle United have confirmed the departure of French winger Allan Saint-Maximin, who has completed his move to Saudi Arabian side Al Ahli. Saint-Maximin spent four years at St James\\' Park, racking up 124 appearances in all competitions and chiming in with 13 goals and 21 assists for good measure. He is now set for a new chapter in the Middle East with Al Ahli, becoming their fourth blockbuster addition after the signings of Edouard Mendy, Roberto Firmino and Riyad Mahrez. \"Four years ago, I wore the Newcastle jersey for the first time.

       "  'text': 'Barcelona winger Ousmane Dembele is closing in on a move to French champions Paris Saint-Germain. 90min understands that he has agreed personal terms over a move back to his homeland and could even be unveiled as a new PSG player by the end of the week. It will bring an end to Dembele\\'s six-year stint in Catalonia - a spell which has been largely underwhelming considering the promise he arrived with and the    145m ( £125m) total fee paid to Borussia Dortmund. PSG will fork over    50m ( £43m) for Dembele. Here are the players Barcelona could, and perhaps should, recruit with that sum. feed Head coach Xavi admitted earlier this week that he is in desperate need of a new natural right-back. \"The right-back is a position that we should look at again, and reinforce,\" he said. \"We have players who adapt but they are not in their natural positions. We will see how everything turns out and how we also fit into financial fair play.\" Few modern day full-backs fit the Barcelona mould the way that Joao Cancelo does. 90min reported on Wednesday that Barca are reigniting their interest in the Portugal international having tried but failed to sign him during the January transfer window. Barcelona would prefer to take Cancelo, who has four years left to run on his Manchester City contract, on an initial loan with an option to buy. Classic Barca trying to kick the can down the road. Right, let\\'s move on to actual winger targets and not just any old player that Barcelona are actively talking about. 90min reported last month that Man City were battling PSG and RB Leipzig for Lyon winger Bradley Barcola, seeing him as a potential replacement for Riyad Mahrez. Barcola ended his breakout 2022/23 season with seven goals and ten assists in 35 games for Lyon. If Barcelona want one of Europe\\'s up-and-coming wide threats, then they should consider entering these sweepstakes. Villarreal winger Yeremy Pino is quickly announcing himself as one of Spanish football\\'s top prospects. He has spent three full seasons in the Yellow Submarine\\'s first team and was part of their Europa League-winning contingent of 2021, while he played a starring role in Spain\\'s Nations League triumph in June. Pino\\'s    80m ( £69m) release clause may prove prohibitive to Barcelona unless they shift a few more players, such as Tottenham targets Franck Kessie and Clement Lenglet. This would be a highly ambitious move and one that would stretch Barcelona in a financial sense, but Joao Felix is a player that would love to make the move and would certainly raise the technical levels of La Blaugrana. In fact, Felix recently discussed his desire to play for Barcelona in an interview with Fabrizio Romano, saying: \"I\\'d love to play for Barca. Barcelona has always been my first choice and I\\'d love to join Barca. It was always my dream since I was a kid. If it happens, it will be a dream come true for me.\" The endless link. Bernardo Silva has continually been tipped to leave Man City and it is usually Barcelona touted as the destination. Barca are still interested, but due to the aforementioned sale of Mahrez, 90min understands that Siva will be staying put at the Etihad Stadium. A versatile Ajax forward who has World Cup experience but has only been linked with a move to the Premier League? This sounds like something Barcelona should be all over. Mohammed Kudus has been the rare shining light for both club and country over the last year, turning on the style in poor Ajax and Ghana teams. 90min understands he is wanted by Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United, who could all probably out-bid Barcelona if push came to shove, unfortunately. Electrifying and fleet-footed, Jeremy Doku would make for a nice project to succeed Dembele. The 21-year-old hasn\\'t quite kicked on since his marvellous performances at Euro 2020 but he has continually been linked with the continent\\'s biggest clubs. Why couldn\\'t it be Barcelona that takes a punt on his potential and upside?',\n",

       "  'text': 'Bayern Munich CEO Jan-Christian Dreesen and technical director Marco Neppe are due in England on Monday for their next meeting with Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy to discuss the future of Harry Kane, 90min understands. After holding a meeting with Levy earlier this month, Bayern had planned for a second set of face-to-face talks with the Spurs chairman last week but saw those plans pushed back at the last minute. Now, the two Bayern officials are expected to front a group of Bayern representatives which will touch down in London on Monday for their long-awaited talks over Kane\\'s future. Two bids from Bayern have already been knocked back by Levy who, up to this point, has not named an asking price or even given any indication that he would be prepared to accept a bid for his talismanic striker this summer. However, with Kane entering the final year of his contract, Spurs owner Joe Lewis has intervened and is understood to have told Levy to authorise a sale if an agreement to extend Kane\\'s contract cannot be struck. feed A club-record bid from Bayern, whose transfer record currently stands at the    80m paid to sign Lucas Hernandez from Atletico Madrid in 2019, is expected to arrive imminently, with the German side determined to take advantage of Kane\\'s expiring contract to get a deal done. There has been plenty of speculation over the reason for the cancellation of last week\\'s meeting between Bayern and Spurs but the German side\\'s president, Herbert Hainer, insisted there was nothing malicious going on. \"Sometimes people read too much into normal processes,\" Hainer told TZ. \"What I can say is that Daniel Levy is a professional.

       "  'text': \"Tottenham have agreed to meet the  £13m release clause of Rosario Central youngster Alejo Veliz, 90min understands. Spurs recently opened talks with the Argentine club for 19-year-old Veliz, who had also attracted interest from AC Milan, Roma, Salernitana and Nottingham Forest. The 19-year-old rose to global prominence during the 2023 FIFA Under-20 World Cup as part of Argentina's squad, scoring three times before his side were knocked out in the last 16 by Nigeria. Rival interest had arisen from Serie A and the Premier League but 90min has been told the young striker made Tottenham his preferred destination which has helped with negotiations. A long-term contract is in the works and no issues are expected to flare up between Veliz and Spurs in that department. Veliz scored 11 times in the 2023 Argentine Primera Division, only two fewer than joint-leading scorers Pablo Vegetti and Michael Santos. He made his debut for Central in 2021 during a Copa Sudamericana clash with Deportivo Tachira and has since netted 19 goals in total for the club. feed Discussions are now being held over Veliz's short-term future. Rosario are keen to keep the teenager - who turns 20 in September - until January on loan and possibly beyond. Tottenham have long needed back-up options for Harry Kane, whose own future in north London is under extreme scrutiny with Bayern Munich confident of completing a deal for the England captain. Richarlison suffered an injury-hit first campaign with Spurs but would be the obvious replacement up front if Kane does leave before the season starts. A central defender is still being targeted with talks advancing for Wolfsburg's Micky van de Ven as new head coach Ange Postecoglou looks to fix a defence that conceded 63 Premier League goals last season. Out of favour Barcelona duo Franck Kessie and Clement Lenglet - the latter of whom spent last season in north London - remain targets, while Denmark international Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg could be shipped off to Atletico Madrid.\",\n",

Paris Saint-Germain forward Kylian Mbappe has made it clear that he would be prepared to join Chelsea this summer, but only for one season as he still has his sights set on a free transfer to Real Madrid in 2024. (Sport) To replace Mbappe, PSG are closing in on the signing of Benfica striker Goncalo Ramos, who will cost close to  £70m. (A Bola) Ousmane Dembele will also join PSG from Barcelona, who will not sign a direct replacement for the Frenchman and will instead put their faith back in young Ansu Fati. (Sport) Harry Kane would be open to signing a new contract with Tottenham if they show significant progress under new manager Ange Postecoglou. (Evening Standard) Spurs face competition from Saudi Arabian outfit Al Nassr over centre-back Clement Lenglet, who could move to the Middle East from Barcelona for  £13m. (Sport) Attempts from Manchester City to renew Kyle Walker's contract have fallen flat, with the England international keen to join Bayern Munich this summer. (The Athletic) manual Chelsea face competition for Brighton midfielder Moises Caicedo after an unnamed club saw a bid rejected which exceeded the Blues' latest offer of  £80m. (Athletic) That mystery club is Liverpool, who are on the lookout for another new midfielder. (Football Insider) Manchester United have now joined Liverpool in pursuit of Southampton midfielder Romeo Lavia. (Independent) Talks have also been stepped up between Man Utd and Bayern Munich midfielder Leon Goretzka, who wants to stay with the Bundesliga champions.

       "  'text': \"Barcelona winger Ousmane Dembele is in line to complete a move to Paris Saint-Germain by the end of the week, 90min understands. 90min reported on Monday that Dembele had agreed personal terms over a move back to France, which came as a bit of a shock to the footballing world considering there had been little speculation suggesting he was looking to leave this summer. Barca head coach Xavi and new club captain Sergi Roberto have both spoken of their surprise and disappointment of Dembele's fresh intentions to leave. Sources have now confirmed to 90min that PSG are closing in on the signing of Dembele after paying a    50m ( £43m) release clause in his Barcelona contract. With that money, the Spanish champions will step up their pursuit of Manchester City's Joao Cancelo. Xavi spoke earlier this week of his desperation to bring in a new right-back and the sale of Dembele should allow them further flexibility in the summer transfer market. feed PSG are hoping to finalise Dembele's move by the end of the week, and 90min understands they are also looking to push through a move for Benfica forward Goncalo Ramos in that timeframe as well. Both head coach Luis Enrique and sporting advisor Luis Campos are keen to add Ramos to their ranks. The French champions previously held an interest in Manchester United-bound Rasmus Hojlund. Ramos is expected to arrive for a fee in the region of    80m ( £69m), while PSG retain an interest in his Portugal teammate Joao Felix. The 23-year-old spent the second half of last season on loan at Chelsea but has since returned to Atletico Madrid. PSG's negotiations with Atleti are not currently advanced, though the deal is not completely dead yet.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Barcelona midfielder Nico Gonzalez has completed a transfer to Portuguese giants Porto. Spain Under-21 international Nico made his Barca debut in 2021 under Ronald Koeman, having renewed his contract that year until 2024 with a whopping    500m release clause. His deal at Camp Nou was then extended to 2026 before departing for a loan spell with Valencia. Things went poorly at the Mestalla as Los Che narrowly avoided relegation in 2022/23, with Nico scoring once in 26 La Liga appearances. feed Barca have now announced his permanent    8.5m departure to Porto, who finished second in the Primeira Liga, and have a buy-back clause should they wish to bring the midfielder back to Camp Nou. The La Liga giants also retain a percentage of any future transfer fee for Nico. New summer arrivals Ilkay Gundogan and Oriol Romeu made Nico's pathway to starting XI football more difficult under Xavi, who already had the likes of Pedri, Gavi, Frenkie de Jong, Sergi Roberto and Franck Kessie to choose from in midfield. He is the latest Barca player to leave this window following the previous exits of Sergio Busquets, Jordi Alba, Samuel Umtiti and Alex Collado. Alongside Gundogan and Romeu, the reigning Spanish champions have also brought in Inigo Martinez on a free transfer from Athletic Club and signed Brazilian forward Vitor Roque to come into effect in 2024/25. They are hopeful of completing more business before the window closes, too. Barca have long been interested in Manchester City's Bernado Silva, though the treble winners are ready to stand firm to stop the Portugal international leaving following the recent departure of Riyad Mahrez to Saudi Pro League side Al Ahli.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Chelsea are close to finalising an agreement with Southampton for the transfer of Romeo Lavia, sources have confirmed to 90min. The Blues have a long-standing interest in the midfielder having tried to sign him last summer just weeks after he first joined the Saints from Manchester City. They continued to monitor Lavia throughout his debut Premier League season, with the teenager breaking into the Belgium senior side despite Southampton's relegation. Liverpool have seen three bids for Lavia rejected by Southampton this summer as they did not meet their  £50m valuation, and the Merseysiders could now be beaten to his signature by Chelsea. feed 90min understands that a deal to take Lavia from St Mary's to Stamford Bridge worth  £55m is close to being agreed, roughly 24 hours after Chelsea reignited their interest in the 19-year-old. Lavia has not made a competitive appearance for Southampton this season due to intense speculation regarding a move away. Chelsea and Liverpool's transfer business in recent days has been intertwined. The Reds appeared to have beaten the Blues to Brighton's Moises Caicedo after launching a British-record  £111m bid on Friday morning, but the Ecuadorian is holding out for a move to west London instead. Though they intend to match Liverpool's mammoth offer in the coming hours, Brighton are yet to receive a new bid from Chelsea. Elsewhere, Chelsea have dropped their interest in Leeds United's Tyler Adams despite agreeing to pay his  £20m relegation release clause this week, with the USMNT captain now returning to Yorkshire.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Manchester United are in talks with Bayern Munich over the possible transfer of 2018 World Cup-winning defender Benjamin Pavard, 90min understands. The versatile Pavard, capable of playing as a centre-back or right-back, joined Bayern in 2019 and has entered the final year of his contract at the Allianz Arena. With Maguire in the process of leaving Old Trafford before next month   s transfer deadline, Pavard had been among a number of options to replace the former captain. As 90min revealed last week, United are preparing to enter the transfer market once Maguire   s exit is completed. The England international had initially wanted to stay and fight for his place, despite slipping down the pecking order last season and losing the captaincy early in pre-season. feed But the Red Devils agreed a  £30m fee with fellow Premier League side West Ham United. Talks have continued to hammer out the details of the proposed deal, although things have progressed slower than had been hoped. That being said, all parties expect a conclusion to still be reached soon. Pavard has been offered to United, with Nice   s Jean-Clair Todibo, ex-Ajax defender Perr Schuurs, Jarrad Branthwaite of Everton, one-time Tottenham target Edmond Tapsoba and Benfica   s Antonio Silva all considered by the club to replace Maguire. But it is the Pavard path on which United are now progressing and 90min understands that negotiations with Bayern over the transfer fee are taking place. The perennial German champions value the Frenchman at  £30m (   35m), which is higher than the  £25.9m (   30m) that United have so far proposed. That figure hasn   t yet convinced Bayern to sell, but the difference in valuation has not dissuaded the sides from continuing to talk.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Moises Caicedo is no stranger to a drawn-out transfer saga. Years before Chelsea began peppering Brighton with dizzying offers only to be outbid by Liverpool, before the Blues bid  £115m to secure his services this week, Caicedo was the subject of a multi-club tussle while he was still in Ecuador with Independiente del Valle. Manchester United, AC Milan, Brighton, Chelsea and Belgian side Club Brugge were all interested in the midfielder after a rapid ascension in senior South American football. Three separate agencies also tried to represent Caicedo and get a slice of any potentially lucrative deal. Ultimately, Brighton cut through the chaos to snag Caicedo for just  £4.5m in 2021. After less than 50 starts for the Seagulls, the 21-year-old has now become one of the most expensive players in the history of the sport. Here's how Caicedo's  £115m move to Chelsea compares to the game's other costly sagas. Chelsea confirmed the signing of Caicedo after one of the most dramatic transfer sagas of recent times. The Blues had been pursuing the midfielder for the majority of the summer, however had been unwilling to make a bid over  £80m until Liverpool agreed to fork out  £111m for his services.  Despite an agreement between Liverpool and Brighton being struck, Caicedo was unwilling to agree to a move to Anfield, opening the door for Chelsea to swoop in and have a  £115m bid accepted for his services.  The midfielder has now put pen to paper on an eight-year deal at Stamford Bridge.  Caicedo has become the most expensive signing for Chelsea and any other British club. But where does he rank on a global scale? Ranking Player Signed Joined Fee 1 Neymar 2017 PSG  £198m 2 Kylian Mbappe 2018 PSG  £163m 3 Philippe Coutinho 2018 Barcelona  £142m 4 Ousmane Dembele 2017 Barcelona  £135m 5 Moises Caicedo 2023 Chelsea  £115m 6 Joao Felix 2019 Atletico Madrid  £113m 7 Enzo Fernandez 2023 Chelsea  £107m 8 Antoine Griezmann 2019 Barcelona  £107m 9 Declan Rice 2023 Arsenal  £105m 10 Jack Grealish 2021 Manchester City  £100m Less than four years after making his senior debut as a 17-year-old in the Ecuadorian top flight, Caicedo has become the fifth most expensive footballer of all time.  Even though Caicedo's fee has scratched nine digits, Neymar's move to PSG comfortably remains the most expensive in history, with the Ligue 1 giants paying  £198m for the forward's services.  Neymar's PSG teammate Kylian Mbappe is second on the list but could have moved into top spot after Al Hilal's  £259m offer was accepted by the French champions. Mbappe ultimately refused to even meet with representatives of the Saudi giants.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Saudi Pro League director of football Michael Emenalo claims the competition can position itself as one of the world\\'s best within the next two years by targeting \\'exceptional players only\\' The former technical director of Chelsea assumed his role in July and is continuing the Pro League\\'s significant  £400m investment initiative. This strategy has enticed players such as Karim Benzema, Jordan Henderson, Riyad Mahrez, and Roberto Firmino to join Saudi Arabian clubs this summer. So far, the majority of top stars heading to Saudi Arabia, including Benzema, N\\'Golo Kante and Cristiano Ronaldo, have been in the latter stages of their respective careers. At 26, Ruben Neves is one of the exceptions to the trend and arguably not in the same bracket of star anyway. Richard Masters, chief executive of the Premier League, recently shared that he isn\\'t overly worried about Saudi Arabia\\'s unrestricted spending. However, Emenalo cautioned that there are essentially no bounds to the country\\'s willingness to invest in football players.  \"I would love  to have Kylian Mbappe here. I would love to have Harry Kane here. The league would like all the top players,\" he said. Indeed, Mbappe has already been the subject of world record  £259m bid from Al Hilal that was accepted by Paris Saint-Germain, although the plater himself wasn\\'t interested in the move. manual \"In a couple of years, this will become a league for exceptional players only. It will become a league for those who are at the top of their game. We have the resources, and we   re going to use them,\" Emenalo said. \"I don   t think it is going to take the same amount of time that it took the [English] Premier League to get there for us to establish ourselves.\" Emenalo emphasised that the Saudi Pro League\\'s aim is not to undermine the Premier League in a manner similar to LIV Golf and the PGA Tour and hopes that elite football\\'s established order in Europe will eventually be less apprehensive and collaborate with them.    The European leagues, especially the Premier League, are very strong, they have no reason to be scared,    he added.    I think there   s panic in some areas, but this is from a misunderstanding of what we are trying to do.    I saw what [Jurgen] Klopp and what [Pep] Guardiola said [about the Pro League]. One is a coach I absolutely admire and the other is a good friend of mine in Pep. First, I hope they don   t talk themselves out of a job [in Saudi Arabia] in the future. I understand their concerns. Our goal is to work together with all the leagues and be a brotherhood in the football industry.   ',\n",

       "  'text': \"Harry Maguire's proposed transfer to West Ham United has collapsed, 90min understands. After telling Maguire he is free to leave Old Trafford this summer, Manchester United initially rejected a  £30m bid from West Ham amid concerns over their ability to satisfy the centre-back's wage demands, only to eventually agree to the offer on the table. West Ham have since completed the signings of Edson Alvarez and James Ward-Prowse but talks over Maguire continued to drag on as they sought to thrash out a wage agreement with both the defender and United. 90min understands that Maguire had agreed the terms of a reduced contract with West Ham but sought a pay-off from United to compensate him for the loss in salary over the remaining two years of his deal at Old Trafford. Sources have now confirmed that no agreement was reached between Maguire and United, forcing West Ham to accept defeat in their pursuit of the centre-back. feed United had been preparing for Maguire's exit by speaking with Bayern Munich over French defender Benjamin Pavard but, as 90min revealed earlier this summer, the Red Devils fear they do not have the financial room to sign another defender with Maguire's high wages still on the books. There has been tentative interest in Maguire from elsewhere but United are not expecting more bids for the 30-year-old, who appears set to remain at Old Trafford beyond this summer. Manager Erik ten Hag is known to be happy to continue working with Maguire as a backup to Raphael Varane and Lisandro Martinez, but he recently warned the England international that he is in for a fight for minutes if he chooses to stay. Maguire remains under contract at United until 2025, with the club holding the option to extend his deal by a further 12 months.\",\n",

The former Manchester City and New York City winger will join Everton for the 2023/24 campaign after activating a clause in his contract following Leeds' relegation from the Premier League. Aston Villa also made a move for Harrison, but upon learning that he would not be fit for another six weeks, they backed away from a deal - Villa are looking at options in the transfer market having lost Emi Buendia to an ACL injury and they wanted someone who could make an immediate impact. Harrison passed a medical with Everton on Sunday but he does have a hip problem that will likely see him sidelined until after the September international break. feed Everton turned to Harrison after accepting defeat in their pursuit of his teammate Willy Gnonto. The Italy international agreed personal terms over a move to Goodison Park, but Leeds would not allow him to leave. Gnonto was one of the few Leeds players in their squad that did not have some sort of release clause, unlike Harrison. Harrison is the latest Leeds player to depart the West Yorkshire giants this summer after returning to the Championship.

The Blue had previously seen a number of bids rejected, the biggest of which had been worth  £80m and was still someway short of the minimum  £100m asking price required by the Seagulls. Now, whilst an agreement is not yet finalised, 90min has been informed that talks are progressing between Chelsea and Brighton and the deal is set to be worth in excess of the  £111m fee agreed with Liverpool earlier in the week. Once confirmed, it would break Chelsea\\'s own British record which they set in January when signing Enzo Fernandez from Benfica in a deal worth  £106m 90min can also confirm that talks between Caicedo have accelerated to the point that personal terms are all finalised and the Ecuadorian is ready to put pen to paper on an eight-year contract as soon as the two clubs confirm an agreement over price is in place. feed Chelsea are hopeful that they could parade both Caicedo and Romeo Lavia, who is close to finalising move from Southampton after a  £55m fee was agreed, ahead of Sunday\\'s Premier League clash with, ironically, Liverpool, who not only wanted Caicedo but also had multiple bids for Lavia rejected. For their part, Brighton are already moving forward with the belief that Caicedo is no longer theirs and boss Roberto De Zerbi considers him a former player. \"I have already forgotten about Moises,\" he said. \"I\\'m really proud of the players we have in the squad. We want to keep improving. The credit goes to the club. Bigger clubs can buy our players but they can\\'t buy our soul or spirit. \"We don\\'t have enough [players] yet, we need to complete the squad. I want players who want to come here. We are Brighton, we achieved a big target last year - the same as Liverpool, better than Chelsea. I would like players who are proud to play in Brighton.\"',\n",

       "  'text': \"Romeo Lavia is to undergo a medical at Chelsea after turning down the chance to join Liverpool, sources have confirmed to 90min. The 19-year-old's future has been the subject of intense speculation for weeks, with a departure from Southampton expected after the club's relegation to the Championship. Chelsea and Liverpool have both been pushing hard to sign Lavia, with the two clubs also doing battle to sign Moises Caicedo from Brighton in a deal that will make the British transfer record currently held by Enzo Fernandez. And just as Caicedo has chosen to move to Stamford Bridge, Lavia has decided his future is also in west London, turning down the opportunity to work under Jurgen Klopp in the process. 90min understands that the Belgian teenager will undergo a medical with Chelsea in the next 24 hours before sealing a move that could eventually be worth  £55m to Southampton. feed Caicedo is also set to imminently put pen to paper on an eight-year contract, joining forces with Fernandez and manager Mauricio Pochettino to create one of the most expensively assembled midfields in world football. Liverpool had indicated a willingness to match Chelsea's offer for Lavia, in the hope that he would choose to join the Reds, but they have again been left disappointed in their hunt for a new defensive midfielder. Fabinho has left the club this summer to join Al Ittihad in Saudi Arabia amid a complete overhaul of Liverpool's midfield. Jordan Henderson, Naby Keita, James Milner and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain have also moved on to pastures new, gutting the core of a side that failed to qualify for this season's Champions League. Alexis Mac Allister, Dominik Szoboszlai and Cody Gakpo started in an extremely attacking midfield three in the 1-1 draw with Chelsea on Sunday, though it was clear in that game that Liverpool need a more defensive-minded player to help protect the backline when the ball is turned over.\",\n",

Along with Caicedo, Liverpool have also faced stiff competition from Chelsea for their other primary midfield target Romeo Lavia. The Reds saw three bids rejected before Chelsea entered the race, initially bidding  £48m before offering  £55m. 90min reported on Sunday that Liverpool are now willing to match Chelsea\\'s bid in the hope of signing Lavia from Southampton. feed When asked by Sky Sports about the ongoing transfer battles between Liverpool and Chelsea after the clubs\\' 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge, Klopp was keen to aim a thinly-veiled dig at the Blues for their spending. \"Where   s the camera? No [I cannot say anything]. Oh, that [new signings] is what the Chelsea manager wants, and usually they get it! I   ve got nothing to say about it to be honest,\" he said. \"I   m sorry.\" Once the Caicedo signing is confirmed, Chelsea will have spent over  £800m on new players since Todd Boehly took over ownership of the club.

       "  'text': 'Brighton and Hove Albion CEO Paul Barber has confessed Moises Caicedo\\'s decision to reject a transfer to Liverpool in favour of joining Chelsea came as a surprise. Chelsea confirmed the  £115m signing of Caicedo on Monday after a tense weekend which began with Liverpool coming out of nowhere to agree a fee of  £111m to sign the Ecuador international. However, Caicedo soon made it clear that he would prefer a move to Stamford Bridge, urging Brighton to reopen negotiations with Chelsea and ultimately sealing the move he was looking for. Barber admitted to talkSPORT that Caicedo\\'s stance left Brighton in an unexpected and \"difficult\" situation as they tried to find an outcome which satisfied everyone. feed \"Liverpool are a fantastic club, you   d imagine anyone would be running up the M6 for the chance to play at Anfield, but for whatever reason, Moises and his advisors decided London was their preferred destination,\" he said. \"In that situation we   re in a difficult position; we   ve negotiated a British record deal deal and spent several days working with Liverpool, who were were professional throughout. \"At that point [when Caicedo rejected the move], we   re out of the loop, it is all between the player and Liverpool. When it became clear he isn   t going to be joining Liverpool, we have to go into a different mode, we then have to do it all again, which we did. \"We started working with Chelsea, and we had to protect our own interests which is the player. We did that and now Moises goes on to the next step in his career.\" Liverpool and Chelsea have also butted heads over Southampton midfielder Romeo Lavia who, like Caicedo, has opted to move to Stamford Bridge this summer.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Paris Saint-Germain have confirmed that Kylian Mbappe has been allowed to return to first-team training after \"constructive and positive discussions\" regarding his future.  90min reported earlier this week that Mbappe had reiterated his desire to stay at PSG beyond this summer despite not taking up his option to trigger a clause which would extend his current contract at the club until the summer of 2025. That decision not to trigger an extension had led to PSG shopping the superstar forward around this summer due to the fear of losing him as a free agent next summer. The Ligue 1 giants accepted a world record offer  of  £257m (   300m) from Al Hilal last month, but despite proposing a gargantuan contract offer to Mbappe, the PIF-backed Saudi Pro League side were  unable to persuade the France star to enter negotiations. On top of trying to sell Mbappe, PSG had also banished the player from first-team training and even refused to select him for their recent pre-season tour of Japan.  manual Now, however, the 2018 World Cup winner is back in the first-team squad and back in training with his teammates after what the club have described as positive talks regarding the player\\'s future which took place on Saturday.  A club statement on the news reads: \"After very constructive and positive discussions between Paris Saint-Germain and Kylian Mbappe before the PSG - Lorient match, this Saturday 12th August, the player was reinstated in first-team training this morning.\"  Mbappe was in the stands on Saturday for PSG\\'s 0-0 draw with Lorient in their Ligue 1 season opener, sitting alongside new teammate Ousmane Dembele, whom the club officially confirmed the signing of on Saturday morning. The pair could feature together for the first time at club level next Saturday when Luis Enrique\\'s team take on Toulouse.',\n",

Club officials have drawn up a long list of potential targets, including former Manchester United star David de Gea, but further contact has been made with Kepa as Madrid seek to explore all their options. Kepa has been targeted by Bayern Munich this week as the German side seek to replace their own injured goalkeeper, Manuel Neuer, but Madrid are now exploring a rival bid for the Chelsea man. feed Chelsea have already been active in the goalkeeper market this summer, selling Edouard Mendy to Al Ahli and replacing him with Robert Sanchez of Brighton, but the interest in Kepa has seen them reignite their search for a new stopper. Long-term target Giorgi Mamardashvili of Valencia remains on Chelsea's wish list, while the Blues are also known to have considered their own move for De Gea, who is available as a free agent following his departure from United. Porto's Diogo Costa has plenty of admirers at Stamford Bridge but is understood to be too expensive for the Blues, who are locked in talks over a double deal for Brighton's Moises Caicedo and Southampton's Romeo Lavia that could cost in excess of  £160m. Madrid are relaxed about their quest for a new stopper, believing there are plenty of options available to them. Leeds United's Illan Meslier has also been added to the shortlist as the Spanish side continue their search. Publicly, manager Carlo Ancelotti has put his faith in usual deputy Andriy Lunin, who is expected to start in goal for Madrid against Athletic Club on Saturday, but a move for a new goalkeeper is expected to be made soon enough.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Real Madrid have suffered a devastating blow on the eve of the new La Liga season, losing their goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois to an anterior cruciate ligament injury. The Belgian colossus has been pivotal to Madrid's success in recent years and Carlo Ancelotti hasn't had to think twice about who to start between the sticks. Courtois has been one of the world's leading shot-stoppers and his absence will be sorely felt by the Spanish side next season. Ancelotti needs a replacement for his number one, and has looked towards his old club Chelsea for a solution. Madrid have expressed their interest in taking Blues goalkeeper Kepa on loan for next season, a deal which Chelsea may be willing to sanction given their recent acquisition of Robert Sanchez. Here's why Real Madrid want Kepa at the Bernabeu. Considering Real Madrid will be relying on Andriy Lunin in their season opener against Athletic Club, Kepa's experience and quality would be a welcome addition to Los Blancos' squad. The Spanish stopper managed 39 appearances after reclaiming his starting spot from Edouard Mendy at Chelsea last year, including two encounters with Real Madrid in the Champions League quarter-finals. Kepa performed admirably given the criticism he has received in previous seasons, establishing himself as the club's guaranteed number one. Kepa ranked in the top 24% of Premier League goalkeepers for saves (3.16), save percentage (73.3%) and goals against (1.16) per 90 last campaign. He also boasted a +0.18 rate when it came to post-shot expected goals  minus goals conceded, suggesting that Kepa was performing significantly above average in terms of his shot-stopping. His ability and competence outside of his own penalty area could also be crucial for Madrid. He ranked in the top 17% of Premier League goalkeepers for number of defensive actions per 90 outside of his box (1.82), showcasing his quality in sweeping up opposition balls over the top. While not as significant in an Ancelotti team, it will still allow Madrid to press higher up the pitch, knowing Kepa can sniff out danger when direct balls are played in behind the defence.  Overall, Kepa provides Madrid with a cost-effective and experienced option. Add this to the fact that he is Spanish and knows La Liga intimately, and it seems like something of a no-brainer for Madrid, especially if they are only exploring a loan deal. Club Appearances Saves Save percentage Clean sheets Chelsea 162 379 69.4% 57 Athletic Club 54 134 67.7% 15 Real Valladolid 40 161 77.8% 12 Ponferradina 19 51 72.9% 8 *All stats courtesy of FBref feed Despite having initially prioritised a move for Sevilla goalkeeper Yassine Bounou, the asking price for the Moroccan appears to be a stumbling block stopping the deal from progressing. Attention has therefore turned to Kepa, who has also interested Bayern Munich, but Real Madrid don't want to rush into making a signing given the multitude of options potentially available to them. Kepa, however, is under serious consideration, with Courtois set for a long spell on the sidelines. At present, Madrid are said to only be interested in loaning the 28-year-old from Chelsea, although such a deal could have an option to buy or mandatory buy clause inserted into it. Given Chelsea's expensive pursuit of Moises Caicedo and Romeo Lavia, a permanent deal that could recoup some transfer funds may be preferential.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Kepa Arrizabalaga has confirmed he hopes to seal a permanent move to Real Madrid after joining the Spanish side on an initial loan from Chelsea. After Thibaut Courtois went down with a serious knee injury, Madrid began searching for a new goalkeeper and eventually settled on Kepa, who joined on Monday in a loan deal which does not include the option for Madrid to make the move permanent. Even though there is no purchase clause in Kepa\\'s loan contract, the 28-year-old made it clear he is looking to stay in Madrid for the foreseeable future. \"I really hope Real Madrid will keep me at the end of the season,\" he told a press conference when asked if he wants to stay at Madrid. \"Today is the first day of my assignment. We have time, we\\'ll see.  \"Hopefully with my performance I can make that happen.\" feed Madrid president Florentino Perez was eager to welcome Kepa, who he described as \"one of the best goalkeepers in the world.\" \"Dear Kepa, welcome to your new home. We know very well what it means to you at this moment and how hard you have worked to be able to defend the jersey and the crest of Real Madrid,\" Perez said. \"We\\'re delighted to have you on board because you\\'re one of the best goalkeepers in the world and we want to continue building on one of the most successful cycles in our history. \"You\\'re also one of the great Spanish goalkeepers. This may be one of the most important moments of your whole professional career and, we hope, of your life. Your hard work, your talent, your commitment, the tireless support of your family and, of course, the will to be a member of the best club in the world have brought you this far. \"You will now experience the emotion of playing at the Santiago Bernabeu stadium, where you will understand its magic and where you will feel the passion from Real Madrid fans, surrounded by a unique fan base that gives their all for Real Madrid. Don\\'t have any doubts, our fans will support you in taking on this challenge that is part of your biggest dreams. Dear Kepa, there are only a few who can experience the emotions that you are about to experience. This new period begins here with this crest full of trophies and unrenounceable values.\"',\n",

       "  'text': 'Liverpool are ready to match Chelsea   s offer for Southampton midfielder Romeo Lavia, 90min understands, with the transfer battle between the Premier League giants continuing. The two clubs have already been at war over Brighton & Hove Albion   s Moises Caicedo in recent days. Chelsea have been pursuing the Ecuador international for months, but it was Liverpool who first agreed a deal with Brighton for a British record fee of  £111m on Friday. Even then, it remained Caicedo   s preference to join Chelsea and the Blues, who had not previously offered more than  £80m, refused to throw in the towel. As it stands, Chelsea are now confident of finalising an agreement with Brighton in excess of the Liverpool offer already accepted. But Caicedo wasn   t the only player that Chelsea looked set to beat Jurgen Klopp   s team to. feed Liverpool, in need of midfielders after letting Jordan Henderson, Fabinho, Naby Keita, James Milner and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain all leave this summer, had earlier seen three bids for Lavia rejected by Southampton     they had been holding out for  £50m, with Liverpool   s best offer totalling  £45m. Suddenly, Chelsea came on the scene and submitted a  £48m bid for Lavia before raising that offer to  £55m - a fee which left the Blues confident of getting a deal done. 90min now understands that Liverpool are ready to make a fourth Lavia offer that matches Chelsea   s bid for the 19-year-old Belgian, who has played only 36 senior club games in his career. As far as Southampton are concerned, they are happy with the developments and keen to see how this bidding war between Chelsea and Liverpool plays out. Lavia, meanwhile, is yet to make known his preference one way or the other, having held positive talks with both clubs.',\n",

The news of the agreement brings to an a frantic few days which has seen Chelsea beat Premier League rivals Liverpool to Caicedo's signature. Chelsea had been pursuing Caicedo all summer but up until last week refused to make a bid of over  £80m, with Brighton demanding at least  £100m for the South American midfielder, until Liverpool suddenly made an offer on Thursday evening and agreed terms on a deal worth  £111m. feed With Caicedo due for a medical on Merseyside on Friday, Liverpool looked to have beaten their top-flight rivals to his signature, but it then emerged that the 21-year-old had informed Brighton of his unwillingness to finalise a move to Anfield as he preferred to join Chelsea. Although Liverpool's offer remained on the table, Chelsea began talks and soon became confident of finally bringing Caicedo to Stamford Bridge. Now Chelsea have agreed a deal worth  £115m which will see them break the British transfer record once again.

Jurgen Klopp   s side have signed both Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboslai to strengthen in midfield since the end of last season. But with Jordan Henderson, Fabinho, James Milner, Naby Keita and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain all leaving, getting additional bodies in has still been important. Liverpool had been in hot pursuit of Romeo Lavia and then Moises Caicedo. Three bids were made for the former, who is now on course to join Chelsea from Southampton in a deal worth up to  £55m. The latter has already signed for Chelsea after the Londoners gazumped Liverpool   s accepted  £111m offer, which would have broken the British transfer record, with a  £115m bid of their own. The Reds still have plenty of potential options to recruit a midfielder and time left to do it before the transfer window closes. One they are keeping tabs on is Adams, who also nearly became a Chelsea player prior to the Lavia and Caicedo sagas reaching a conclusion. feed As 90min reported at the time, Chelsea triggered the  £20m release clause in Adams    contract with Leeds. The United States international then travelled to London for talks but ended up returning to west Yorkshire when negotiations collapsed at the same time as Lavia and Caicedo talks accelerated.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Erik ten Hag has admitted that he wants Manchester United to make a few more signings during the summer transfer window. The Red Devils have been one of the busier Premier League teams thus far this summer, spending big to sign Andre Onana, Mason Mount and Rasmus Hojlund before their first Premier League game of the season against Wolverhampton Wanderers. There have also been plenty of outgoings too, with Anthony Elanga, David de Gea and Fred among the players let go, while Harry Maguire could be set to follow suit with the club recently accepting a  £30m bid from West Ham United for the defender. feed Speaking at his pre-match press conference ahead of Monday night\\'s clash with Wolves, Ten Hag admitted that is keen to sign more players. \"I will always want more [players]! But I think every manager you could ask would also want more. But it is about the mentality; in top football we are talking about the demand, the absolute maximum. Because we demand that from our players and, in their defence, they expect it from us,\" he said. \"We are looking for the perfect situation but you never get the perfect situation. Then you have to come into your place and work for that, maybe with not the perfect situation but the perfect results.\" With Maguire set to leave,  Ten Hag may get his wish as 90min  recently reported that Man Utd are set to enter the transfer market in search of some centre-back cover. Jean Clair-Todibo, Perr Schuurs, Jarrad Branthwaite and Edmond Tapsoba have all been linked, while the club are also in talks with Bayern Munich over Benjamin Pavard too.',\n",

Caicedo has signed an eight-year contract at Stamford Bridge until 2031. \"I am so happy to join Chelsea!\" the 21-year-old said. \"I am so excited to be here at this big club and I didn   t have to think twice when Chelsea called me, I just knew I wanted to sign for the club.

       "  'text': 'From Stamford Bridge - The stage was set perfectly. Chelsea and Liverpool had been going at it hammer and tongs in the transfer market in the week leading up to their Premier League fixture at Stamford Bridge on Sunday afternoon. Moises Caicedo was, and remains, the object of their desires. The Brighton midfielder will become the most expensive player in Premier League history when he does eventually transfer, at some point in the coming week, you\\'d expect, with Liverpool initially having an offer accepted of  £111m for the Ecuadorian.  Caicedo has made his decision known that he\\'d prefer the move to west London, triggering public embarrassment for Liverpool - a club usually so efficient and proficient with their dealings to buy and sell first team players.  feed Having won the transfer pending an agreement with Brighton, which will be in the region of a quite ridiculous  £115m, Chelsea had hoped to present the player to their home support with a deal completed in the days leading up to their 1-1 draw on Sunday. One for the social media channels to rack up the engagements on, y\\'know, but it wasn\\'t to be. Caicedo wasn\\'t there, but good grief did both teams want him to be, with the need for a dominating defensive midfielder desperately obvious for both throughout a frantic, chaotic 101 minutes of opening weekend action. But what did Sunday\\'s game tell us about which team more desperately needs to break the British transfer record to sign a player with only 53 appearances in English football to his name? Liverpool might need a defensive midfielder, will try to confirm as and when pic.twitter.com/gg4CVUB0wd At least new Chelsea boss Mauricio Pochettino settled for pragmatism (in look and feel at least) as he attempted to cover the lack of defensive presence in midfield by naming a back three. Axel Disasi was named for a competitive debut alongside returning loanee Levi Colwill, with Thiago Silva relied upon in the middle. It suggested at least he was looking to stem the tide and not give too much away - though insisted post-match that his team played with four at the back. For Jurgen Klopp, it was back to gung-ho and heavy metal. You\\'d suppose you can\\'t name a six in your team if you don\\'t possess one, but Klopp went down the route of \"screw it\" with his team sheet, naming new signings Dominik Szoboszlai and Alexis Mac Allister alongside Cody Gakpo in the most attacking of midfield units.  Mac Allister was tasked with being the deepest midfielder, operating with Trent Alexander-Arnold drifting in from the right full back slot. Who needs Moises Caicedo more? Liverpool, because I\\'m not changing my system Caicedo is largely praised for his ability to cover ground, shuttling across to cover spaces left behind his teammates with the licence to attack. Fair to say both teams could have really utilised him here - first half especially - and that whichever team gets him will have a gem for next decade in a dream scenario. The opening 45 was a story of Pure, Unadulterated Barclays: Chaos Edition, with both teams\\' defences breached. Liverpool fired a warning after 12 minutes when Mohamed Salah struck the bar, but hit the front before the 20th minute after some excellent work from the Egyptian. Chelsea left far too much space for Salah to take possession and far too much space behind their back line for Luis Diaz to tap in at the far post. Plenty at fault but good defensive midfielders stop breakaways at source. There\\'d have been little Caicedo could\\'ve done about the way Chelsea\\'s equaliser came about - this was a story of space behind the back line and defenders switching off - but both teams had the ball in the net on a further occasion each only to see efforts ruled out for offside. In the second half, Conor Gallagher far better embraced the role he\\'d been given for the day as a midfield screen, while 90min POTM Enzo Fernandez grew in stature throughout with an imperious performance in possession. It meant the hosts shaded the second half, controlled the lions\\' share of possession and the chaos of the game had subsided...barring a frantic final few minutes. Who needs Moises Caicedo more?  Draw, because Conor Gallagher can\\'t play like he did in the second half every week and Liverpool do not own a senior defensive midfielder WhoScored have Chelsea\\'s pass completion at 88% compared to the visitors\\' 80%, but that could have something to do with Liverpool\\'s direct style on the day and push to get the ball forward. There were spells throughout the first half and before Chelsea found their feet where Liverpool were cutting the hosts open with direct passes through the middle and through the channels, but over the course of the game Chelsea stomped it out. The Blues themselves found moments to penetrate with vertical passes through the middle and often threatened with charges up the pitch from players in possession - they could have won the match late on following a break in that manner. You\\'d have to chalk Chelsea\\'s name on the board for better use of the ball today on the whole; namely because Enzo Fernandez is very good at football. But both teams have holes to fill. Who needs Moises Caicedo more? Liverpool, because they don\\'t have a six and won\\'t change their system During his time at Brighton, Caicedo was often seen covering in the absence of others at right back - and players nowadays - especially those who cost north of  £100m - are hugely valued for versatility. Chelsea won\\'t need that kind of cover given their options at right-sided centre back and with Malo Gusto joining the party over the summer and with Reece James named as club captain. Chelsea do need options and numbers in midfield but Caicedo\\'s name is a dream scenario and the completion of a midfield unit. Liverpool, meanwhile, only have 18-year-old Stefan Bajcetic as a natural presence in defensive midfield - and nobody else following the sales of Fabinho and Jordan Henderson, while they rely on Ibrahima Konate to cover three or four positions when Alexander-Arnold steps into midfield and Liverpool don\\'t have the ball. The Reds are in desperate need of a defensive presence in the centre and it would add levels to their game very quickly if they found the right fit. Who needs Moises Caicedo more? Liverpool Based on the evidence of today - from Jurgen Klopp\\'s decision to play Alexis Mac Allister at six while he wore 10 on his back, from Mauricio Pochettino\\'s decision to use a 3-5-2, from the second half performances of Conor Gallagher and Enzo Fernandez and from the apparent ease for opposing teams to progress through Liverpool\\'s centre, you\\'d have to say it\\'s Liverpool. Their bid has been accepted by Brighton but advances have been halted by the player, with Chelsea now primed to step in and complete the transfer in the week to come. They may even sign up Southampton\\'s Romeo Lavia to really take the biscuit - though Klopp\\'s team are to fight to the end on that one too with no decision from the player yet. If Chelsea do manage to secure their top target for the summer, they\\'ll have a midfield unit of Caicedo and Enzo which will be the envy of the Premier League for seasons to come. It\\'ll have cost in the region of  £220m for the two, but if you\\'re going for best in class, you\\'ve got to spend. Who needs Moises Caicedo more? Liverpool, but they\\'re not getting him are they?',\n",

       "  'text': 'Erik ten Hag has told Harry Maguire to leave Manchester United if he is not willing to fight for his place in the starting lineup. Maguire fell out of favour under Ten Hag during his first season in charge, making just eight Premier League starts under the new manager. Last month, the defender was stripped of the club captaincy, with the armband being given to Bruno Fernandes ahead of the new campaign. All of this has notably led to a huge amount of speculation around the player\\'s long-term future at Old Trafford, and with West Ham having seen a bid of  £30m now accepted by the Red Devils it looks as though Maguire is set to leave the club. 90min understands that although Maguire hasn\\'t been fully convinced of leaving Man Utd this summer, he is open to a move to West Ham and is likely to accept their contract offer.  Speaking about defender\\'s Man Utd future and seemingly impending transfer to the Hammers, Ten Hag told the press ahead of the club\\'s Premier League season-opener against Wolves that, if Maguire isn\\'t willing to fight for his place in the team, then he should leave. \"For Harry, he has to fight for his place. He has the ability to be a top-class centre-back, he is the best for England so why shouldn\\'t he be the best for us?\" Ten Hag said. \"But he has to prove it. When he is not confident enough to go with that fight then he has to go, he has to make the decision. But I am happy with him. feed \"We don\\'t have a squad with 11 players. Last year proved definitely we need all the players, so you need high level players who are maybe not starting but that can change, so there is an internal competition and everyone has to fight for his place. For many players that counts, when they are good they will get their games but no one can play all the games and finally, you find out what is the best team. \"In the squad now, all the positions are double and every player has the perspective to fight for his place. Then you have to show with your contribution it\\'s the best team performance. It is up to the players if they have the game time or less.\" In light of Maguire\\'s potential departure, 90min recently reported that Man Utd are set to enter the transfer market in search of some centre-back cover. Names that have been linked already include Jean Clair-Todibo, Perr Schuurs, Jarrad Branthwaite and Edmond Tapsoba. Man Utd are also in talks with Bayern Munich regarding versatile France defender Benjamin Pavard.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal have confirmed the signing of superstar forward Neymar from Paris Saint-Germain.  90min understands that the Saudi Arabian club have paid    90m ( £77.6m) for the 31-year-old\\'s services, brining an end to his six-year stay at PSG. The Ligue 1 club made Neymar the most expensive footballer in history back in 2017, signing the player for  £190m.  While the Brazilian won five Ligue 1 titles in Paris, he struggled with a number of muscle injuries throughout his time at the club, failing to make more than 22 league appearances in any of his six campaigns with the club.  Speaking to PSG\\'s official website, club chairman and CEO Nasser Al-Khelaifi said: \"It is inevitably difficult to say goodbye to a legend of the Club, which Neymar will be forever. I will never forget the day he arrived at Paris Saint-Germain, nor what he brought to our club and our project over the past six years. \"We have lived extraordinary moments and Neymar will always be part of our history. I would like to thank him and his family. We wish Neymar the best for the future and his next adventure.\"  manual Neymar has put pen to paper on a two-year deal in Saudi Arabia, and has picked the number 10 jersey to wear at Al Hilal.  Talks also remain on between PSG and Al Hilal over midfielder Marco Verratti, who could reunite with Neymar in the Middle East if the two clubs can agree on a fee. Al Hilal have been incredibly active in the transfer market so far this summer, bringing in Kalidou Koulibaly, Ruben Neves, Sergej Milinkovic-Savic and Malcom already.',\n",

Wilcox, who expects to see Lavia\\'s move sealed this week, offered fans at the BBC Solent Fans    Forum an insight into the complicated negotiations with both Liverpool and Chelsea. \"I think you know, it\\'s well known that we\\'ve had some significant interest in Romeo, we\\'ve had an offer which we accepted from Liverpool,\" Wilcox began. \"Then Chelsea came to the table.

       "  'text': \"Chelsea are moving closer to a deal to sign Crystal Palace midfielder Michael Olise, 90min understands. Arsenal and Manchester City were both intrigued by news of a  £35m release clause in Olise's contract but, as 90min reported last month, Chelsea have long been confident they would win the race for his signature. Talks over personal terms have been ongoing for weeks and now sources have confirmed to 90min that Chelsea have taken a step forward in their negotiations with Palace as they seek to get an agreement over the line. Olise, who can play both in midfield and out on the wing, spent several years in the Chelsea academy before leaving aged 14, while his brother Richard, 18, is part of the Blues' Under-21 setup currently. feed Chelsea hope to finalise Olise's signing soon but are in no rush to do so as the 21-year-old is currently sidelined with a hamstring injury he picked up at this summer's Under-21 European Championships. Olise is not expected to return to the pitch until the end of September at the earliest so there is no imminent deadline to get the Frenchman registered for any upcoming fixtures, unlike midfielder Romeo Lavia, whose transfer from Southampton could be completed in time for the Belgian to face West Ham United on Sunday alongside fellow new arrival Moises Caicedo. 90min understands that Chelsea are expected to end their midfield rebuild once the moves for Lavia and Olise are finalised, with the Blues set to switch their attention to finding a goalkeeper to replace Kepa Arrizabalaga, who joined Real Madrid on loan and admitted during his presentation that he wants to stay in Spain beyond this season. A new striker is also a possibility for Chelsea, who lost Christopher Nkunku to a knee injury for the next four months.  Nicolas Jackson has impressed up top for Mauricio Pochettino's side, but Chelsea are otherwise short in attack as 21-year-old Armando Broja is still pushing to return from an ACL injury. Academy striker Mason Burstow was on the bench for the season-opener against Liverpool.\",\n",

Neymar will wrap up a move to Saudi Arabia this week with Al Hilal set to pay    90m ( £77.6m) to PSG, and 90min understands the 31-year-old has been given the freedom to pick a new shirt number. Instead of taking on a new digit, Neymar will stick with his tried and tested number 10, which is currently free and will not need to be vacated. feed Neymar has worn the 10 shirt throughout his time at PSG and has played most of his games for Brazil with that number. He previously took the number 11 at Santos and Barcelona.  Sources have also told 90min that Al Hilal have not given up hope of signing Aleksandar Mitrovic. They reached an agreement with the Serbia international over personal terms earlier this summer, but despite indicating a willingness to pay    58m ( £50m), Fulham were unwilling to sanction a sale. PSG, meanwhile, are continuing their squad clear-out with the departures of Leandro Paredes and Renato Sanches to Roma. Argentine World Cup winner Paredes is set to return to the Stadio Olimpico after a previous spell with the Giallorossi on a permanent two-year deal, while Sanches is joining on an initial loan with an obligatory purchase clause if he plays in more than 60% of their Serie A matches this season.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Manchester United   s hopes of offloading fringe midfielder Donny van de Beek to Real Sociedad have taken a hit amid stalled talks, 90min understands. Van de Beek was a Ballon d   Or nominee in 2019 thanks to his starring role for Erik ten Hag   s Ajax team on their journey to getting within seconds of the Champions League final. But a cruel combination of difficulty adapting to more physical English football, injuries, poor form and a lack of confidence has seen the Dutchman struggle to make an impact at Old Trafford, even after being reunited with former boss and mentor Ten Hag last season. As 90min has reported, Van de Beek has been exploring his options to leave throughout the summer, with his agents in contact with a number of European clubs. That follow decisions from Ten Hag, who retains a healthy relationship, and the club to give him permission to move on. In addition to AC Milan, Inter and Roma, there was Premier League interest from Wolves, Nottingham Forest and Crystal Palace, plus from Celtic north of the Scottish border. feed An offer from Real Sociedad came in early August, with the Spanish club proposing a loan with option to buy ahead of their return to the Champions League this season. However, a problem has arisen. 90min understands that the two clubs have so far been unable to come to an agreement over the exact make up of the deal. Van de Beek himself remains particularly keen and so there is still an underlying expectation that it will happen, but there is now a threat of Real Sociedad potentially walking away altogether. United have already successfully offloaded Fred to Fenerbahce, raising  £13m in the process, and departures from the midfield are important to free up space on the wage bill as the club continues to target Fiorentina and Morocco star Sofyan Amrabat.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Bayern Munich have completed the long-awaited signing of Harry Kane from Tottenham Hotspur. The 30-year-old has signed a four-year contract with the Bundesliga giants, bringing the curtain down on a glittering Spurs career that saw him usurp Jimmy Greaves as the club\\'s all-time record goalscorer. Kane has been Bayern\\'s primary target this summer, as the Bavarians look to finally replace the guaranteed goals of Robert Lewandowski, and have finally got a deal over the line after months of negotiating with Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy. 90min understands that Bayern will pay    100m ( £86.4m) to Tottenham for Kane, but the deal could be worth more should potential add-ons be triggered. \"Bayern is one of the biggest clubs in the world, and I   ve always said that I want to compete and prove myself at the highest level during my career,\" Kane told Bayern\\'s media team after confirmation of the move. \"This club is defined by its winning mentality.\" Kane leaves the Premier League widely regarded as one of the greatest strikers of the modern era. A Spurs academy graduate quickly dubbed \\'one of our own\\', he broke into the first team towards the back end of the 2013/14 season, before scoring 21 Premier League goals and 31 in all competitions the following year. manual The club\\'s famous number 10 shirt was soon his, and Kane continued to deliver the goods for Tottenham in addition to becoming one of England\\'s best players. He won multiple Premier League Player of the Month awards (seven in total) and was named in the PFA Premier League Team of the Year five times. Kane also bagged the Premier League Golden Boot three times, though his career-best 30 goals during the 2017/18 season was not enough to earn him the gong ahead of Mohamed Salah. That goal haul was matched last season despite Tottenham\\'s struggles in the Premier League, and it was apparent that Kane, who came close to leaving the club a couple of years ago to join Manchester City, may need to leave in order to fulfil his trophy ambitions. With just a year left on his contract, Real Madrid and Manchester United were expected to pounce, but it\\'s Bayern Munich who have got a deal over the line after months of courting. Kane is believed to have been registered in time to play in Saturday\\'s night German Super Cup final against RB Leipzig - a game that could see Kane lift the first silverware of his club career less than 24 hours after arriving in Germany.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Bayern Munich have told Manchester United that they want a fee of    40m ( £34.5m) plus add-ons for Benjamin Pavard, 90min understands. The 27-year-old is keen to leave the Allianz Arena this summer in search of a new challenge having lifted numerous trophies since arriving in Bavaria from Stuttgart in 2019. United, meanwhile, are keen to sign a new centre-back as they attempt to offload Harry Maguire to West Ham United in a  £30m deal, with Pavard's name high up on an extensive list of potential transfer targets. 90min previously revealed that United had open talks with Bayern over a deal for Pavard, who can play at right-back and at centre-back, and were working towards a deal that valued the World Cup winner at    35m ( £30m). But sources have confirmed to 90min that Bayern have communicated to United that they're looking for    40m plus add-ons for Pavard, much to the chagrin of the 13-time Premier League winners. Pavard is said to be unimpressed with Bayern's change in stance, with personal terms agreed in principle over a move to Old Trafford, with United also surprised by the moving of the goalposts. feed Talks are ongoing between the two parties, with United in particular keen to find a resolution, but Bayern's inability to land Kyle Walker from Manchester City means the Bundesliga giants could change their stance entirely on a potential sale. Jean-Clair Todibo, Perr Schuurs, Jarrad Branthwaite, Edmond Tapsoba and Benfica   s Antonio Silva are other options being considered by United, as they bid to strengthen the depth of Erik ten Hag's squad, though they don't offer the same positional versatility that Pavard does. To add fuel to the rumour fire, Pavard liked an Instagram post from United's official Instagram account that celebrated Raphael Varane's winner against Wolves on Monday night - though the two are international teammates and are known to be close friends. United have signed Andre Onana, Mason Mount and Rasmus Hojlund for significant transfer fees this summer, also adding Jonny Evans to their squad on a short-term deal. There have also been a number of outgoing this summer, with David de Gea and Freed the most high-profile exits to date. Maguire may follow, providing he gives an imminent answer to West Ham over a move to London Stadium, and there's continued speculation over the future of midfielder Scott McTominay.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Tottenham Hotspur defender Eric Dier could leave the club before the end of the summer transfer window with a number of teams considering a move for him, sources have confirmed to 90min. Dier has less than one year left to run on his Spurs contract but an agreement over an extension has not been reached and is not believed to be close. 90min were first to report back in June that Tottenham would be open to selling Dier as he was not in the immediate plans of new head coach Ange Postecoglou. The 29-year-old was left out of Spurs' matchday squad for their Premier League opening day draw at Brentford on Sunday, with Postecoglou revealing this was a tactical decision as Dier was fully fit. He was also omitted from the Greek-Australian's new-look leadership group despite playing a prevalent role under previous managers. With new vice-captain Cristian Romero, summer signing Micky van de Ven, Davinson Sanchez and Ben Davies all ahead of Dier in the pecking order, he could leave before the window closes, with Tottenham looking to trim their bloated squad ahead of the deadline on 1 September. Dier, who grew up in Portugal from the age of seven, admitted last year that he would like to play abroad again, and 90min understands he could get his wish. Former side Sporting CP would contemplate a reunion if they were to sell in-demand defender Goncalo Inacio in the next few weeks, while Lisbon rivals Benfica are also monitoring Dier in case their own highly-rated centre-back Antonio Silva leaves. However, it is likely that both clubs will keep hold of their homegrown stars for the time being. feed Ligue 1 side Monaco, who have been linked with Fulham defender and Tottenham target Tosin Adarabioyo, have asked Tottenham about the availability of Dier, as have a number of Bundesliga teams. Closer to home, London neighbours Crystal Palace and Scottish champions Celtic are believed to be admirers of Dier. There is also pressing interest in Dier from Saudi Pro League side Al Nassr, who already have the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Sadio Mane on their books. Unlike Dier's other suitors, they would be able to pay Spurs a more generous transfer fee, with European clubs looking for a cut-price deal. Dier joined Tottenham from Sporting back in 2014 and was one of their first signings under Mauricio Pochettino. He spent much of his debut season playing at right-back or centre-back before being moved into midfield under the Argentine. Since Spurs hired Jose Mourinho in 2019, Dier has almost exclusively played in his preferred centre-back role. He's played 361 games in all competitions for the Lilywhites.\",\n",

The Gunners allowed previous deputy Matt Turner to join Nottingham Forest earlier this month and have now replaced him with the in-demand Raya. A small loan fee has been paid and 90min understands Arsenal also have the option to buy Raya permanently for a total package of  £30m. Sporting director Edu told the club\\'s official website: \"We welcome David to us on a season-long loan from Brentford.  \"David is a top-quality goalkeeper, who has consistently performed to a high level with Brentford in the Premier League.

Barcelona president Joan Laporta is understood to be keen on a reunion with Neymar but manager Xavi has publicly claimed that the Brazilian is not part of the club\\'s transfer plans.

       "  'text': 'As the years go by, more and more money is being spent by clubs in the transfer market. Lucrative broadcasting rights, commercial deals and other premium sponsorship means clubs are richer than ever, particularly if they have happen to being playing in the Premier League. The biggest transfers seen in world football may have happened around continental Europe, sure, but the level of spending in England, and regularity of it, is at an all-time high. And with Moises Caicedo\\'s  £115m move from Brighton to Chelsea now complete, the British transfer record has been smashed a whopping 19 times since the Premier League\\'s inception in 1992. Here\\'s every player and move to hold that accolade... Alan Shearer had only scored 23 goals in 118 appearances for Southampton by the time he left for Blackburn Rovers in 1992 - an average a goal just over every five games. But the soon-to-be Premier League winners, who had earned their place in the top flight via the second tier play-offs, knew exactly what they were getting with Shearer. A player who finish with both feet, bury headers for fun, and smash them in from close range and from long distance. Not even Blackburn could have imagined Shearer\\'s time at Ewood Park to go as well as it did, mind you. He scored 112 goals for the club four seasons - one of those was severely disrupted by injury - and scored over 30 in each of his final three, including lifting the title in 1995. One of Sir Alex Ferguson\\'s greatest pieces of work was nipping in ahead of Blackburn, who were being bankrolled by multi-millionaire Jack Walker, to sign Roy Keane for Manchester United. It was a genuine move from Ferguson as Keane spearheaded United\\'s domination of the Premier League for the next decade -  the Irishman establishing himself at the very top of the game in terms of performance level and leadership qualities. Seven Premier League crowns and five appearances in the PFA Premier League Team of the Year tells you all you need to know. Fresh from scoring 25 goals for Norwich City in the 1993/94 Premier League season, Chris Sutton was picked up by Blackburn for  £4m to partner Shearer up front. The transfer was an immediate success as the dynamic duo, flanked by Stuart Ripley and Jason Wilcox on the wings, scored goals for fun to steer Rovers to the title on the final day of the season. Sutton stayed at the club for further four years, bagging a career-best 18 league goals in Blackburn colours during the 1997/98 season. If you\\'re of a certain age, you\\'ll know the saying \\'Cole score goals\\'. Sir Alex Ferguson and Manchester United certainly knew it, which is why they decided to fork out  £7m to sign Cole from Newcastle United in January 1995, including send Keith Gillespie the other way. He scored 12 in 18 during his first half season in red and another 81 across the next six years. Multiple Premier League titles followed as a result, with Cole\\'s superb lob over Ian Walker to secure the 1998/99 crown one of his finer moments. Dennis Bergkamp arrived at Arsenal to huge fanfare in 1995 and it didn\\'t take the Dutchman long to drag the club out of the mid-table doldrums. Under the management of Arsene Wenger, Bergkamp helped transform the Gunners into genuine title contenders, forming a deadly partnership up front with Ian Wright while linking up with the brilliant Marc Overmars on the wing. Arsenal won the Premier League title in 1997/98, 2001/02 and 2003/04, with Bergkamp\\'s contributions earning him a statue outside the Emirates Stadium. \"Collymore closing in!\" is among the most iconic lines of commentary in Premier League history. It was uttered by Martin Tyler, former voice of Sky Sports, in the final moments of the iconic 4-3 thriller between Liverpool and Newcastle in April 1996. It also had a defining impact on that season\\'s title race, costing Newcastle in their fierce battle with Manchester United. Collymore\\'s rise had been rapid to the say the least. He had struggled to make an impact in the top flight as a teenager with Crystal Palace, before joining Nottingham Forest in the second tier afetr a spell at Southend. He then took his prolific lower league form into the Premier League and was poached by Liverpool for a British record fee after just one season (and 22 goals). Alan Shearer\\'s move to boyhood club Newcastle in 1996 wasn\\'t just a British record transfer, it was a world record too - the  £15m deal surpassed the  £13.2m that Barcelona paid to PSV Eindhoven for Brazilian prodigy Ronaldo only weeks earlier that same summer. Manchester United were also very keen on Shearer too, but were famously to the deal. Most thought it was Shearer\\'s desire to join his home town team, who had narrowly missed out on the 1995/96 Premier League title and played some of the best football in the country under Kevin Keegan. But then Manchester United chairman has claimed in more recent years there was more to it. \"Shearer had been to Alex Ferguson\\'s house, spoke to him and assured him he wanted to come [to Manchester],\" Edwards said on a podcast while promoting a book in 2019. \"The problem, I think, was with the chairman of Blackburn, Jack Walker, who was not a great fan of Manchester United...local rivals, both Lancashire clubs. He did not want Alan Shearer to come to Manchester United. Shearer was quite close to Walker, who was like a father figure to him, and I don\\'t think Alan wanted to upset him by coming to United. And I\\'m not sure Jack would have let him come anyway, whereas he was happy for Alan to go to Newcastle, I don\\'t think that was a threat to him.\" Shearer went on to score 206 goals in 10 years at Newcastle, breaking the club\\'s all-time record previously held for decades by Jackie Milburn. Leeds made Rio Ferdinand the world\\'s most expensive defender when they paid  £18m to West Ham in the final weeks of 2000. The club\\'s overspending would later lead to their financial demise, but the good times briefly rolled with Ferdinand dressed in all-white at the back. A few months after his arrival in west Yorkshire, the centre-back scored a famous goal in a Champions League quarter-final demolition of Deportivo La Coruna. His presence also coincided with a massive upturn in their domestic form, losing just two Premier League games in the second half of 2000/01 after a poor start to the campain. Manchester United had initially agreed to sign Ruud van Nistelrooy in 2000, only for the transfer to fall through over concerns about fitness. The Dutch stiker then suffered a dreaded ACL injury during a PSV Eindhoven training session, but United were still prepared to shell out a record fee in 2001. His goalscoring was immediate, netting twice on his Premier League debut and scoring 36 in all competitions on his first season, upping that number to 44 in his second. Van Nistelrooy finished his United career in 2006 with 150 goals in 219 games, an average of 30 per season, but is arguably an underrated part of the club\\'s modern history because of what the likes of Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo went on to achieve in the years that immediately followed. \"I used to get excited when the club would sign a big player because that   s the nature of the game. Veron came to the club, he was an excellent player, okay it didn   t work out for him at United, but he was an excellent player,\" Roy Keane said in 2020, looking back on Juan Sebastian\\'s two seasons at Manchester United. Veron signed for United having developed a lofty reputation thanks to his exploits in Serie A with Parma and Lazio. There was initial promise, that\\'s for sure, and the Argentine particularly enjoyed the European nights, but struggled to cope with the physical demands of an entire Premier League season without a fixed role in the team. Injuries compromised his second season at Old Trafford after a promising start to the campaign, and United opted to cut their losses and sell to Chelsea in 2003. Undeterred by Veron\\'s struggles, United broke the British record again the following summer, although Ferdinand\\'s familiarity with the English game perhaps rendered his  £29.3m arrival from Leeds substantially less of a risk.  Sir Alex Ferguson never doubted Rio\\'s capacity to become one of the world\\'s best in his position - his displays for England at the 2022 World Cup did that opinion no harm - and he rapidly developed into a stalwart of United\\'s defence. Frighteningly quick and unerringly cool in possession, Ferdinand was the ultimate modern-day centre-back. He enjoyed a stellar 12-year career at Old Trafford, lifting six Premier League trophies and the Champions League in 2008. He\\'s recognised as one of England\\'s greatest defenders and a modern Manchester United legend.  It took a little while for Ferdinand\\'s record to go, but smashed it was in the summer of 2006 as Chelsea prised former Ballon d\\'Or winner Andriy Shevchenko away from AC Milan.  The former Dynamo Kyiv hotshot emerged as one of the world\\'s most potent forwards during his time in Lombardy. Shevchenko departed Milan as their second leading scorer of all-time and with a Champions League medal in his back pocket, and the Ballon d\\'Or on his mantelpiece. However, the Ukrainian striker struggled to adjust to life in west London. His two years at Chelsea were rather forgettable. He scored here and there, and only rarely did he put together a sustained run of form. The striker\\'s apex was in the rearview mirror, that\\'s for sure, and he returned to Milan on loan for the 2008/09 season before eventually settling back in Kyiv. This signing ignited the revolution that culminated in Manchester City blossoming into the Premier League\\'s supreme force. On the same day City were bought out by the Abu Dhabi United Group, they quickly went to work and signed Brazilian star Robinho from Real Madrid for a British record  £32.5m. City had been haggling Reggina and Portsmouth for the additions of Rolando Bianchi and Benjani respectively in the preceding months, now they were negotiating with Europe\\'s elite. Money talks. Supposedly persuaded by City\\'s Brazilian contingent that included former Santos teammate Elano, Robinho signed up for the project in Manchester and made an immediate difference. His first season at the club was superb as he ended the 2008/09 as the Premier League\\'s fourth-highest goalscorer with 14. However, things quickly turned sour for the maverick attacker as injuries reduced his significance dramatically in year two. Discontent and perhaps fed up of listening to Mark Hughes, Robinho returned to Santos on loan in January 2010 and was never seen again in Manchester. Panic or sheer recruiting incompetence? Either way, Torres was never going to live up to his  £50m price tag at Stamford Bridge.  The Spaniard was no longer the phenom that took the Premier League by storm at Liverpool, with injuries reducing his explosiveness and rendering him a nondescript threat. Torres was forced to evolve and while the striker that rocked up at Chelsea was a shell of his peak-self, he remained somewhat useful. He was never prolific for the Blues during his three-and-a-half years at the club, but he did score one of the most memorable goals in Chelsea\\'s history away at Barcelona in the 2011/12 Champions League semi-finals. For that, many supporters overlooked his mammoth price tag. The ultimate maverick. A youthful but ambitious Pogba departed Manchester United for greater first-team opportunities overseas in 2012 and ended up at Juventus.  The Frenchman dazzled during his four years in Turin, swiftly evolving into the personification of a highlight reel and a bona fide superstar. Given his prestige, it was going to cost an arm and a leg for United to bring the midfielder \\'home\\'. But they did exactly that in 2016, handing Juve  £89m for his services. Now, summarising Pogba\\'s second stint at United is rather tricky. While the conclusion was somewhat sombre, the Frenchman did enjoy some scintillating runs of form at Old Trafford. However, it\\'s fair to say he couldn\\'t quite justify United\\'s massive outlay to bring him back, especially given that he eventually left for nothing (again) when he re-signed for Juve in 2022. Considering their riches, it\\'s pretty remarkable that City only appear on this list twice. Nevertheless, they made Grealish the first-ever Englishman to garner a  £100m fee in 2021.  The marvellous Brummie playmaker had put Aston Villa on his back during the 2019/20 season to keep the Villans in the Premier League, and a move away became increasingly inevitable after a fine 2020/21 campaign. City bit the bullet and acquired Grealish for a record fee after triggering his release clause, but it took the wide man a little while to find his feet at the Etihad. Adjusting to Pep Guardiola\\'s demands is never easy, and Grealish struggled to flourish in his debut season. But he excelled in year two and played an underrated role in City\\'s historic treble triumph. Overpriced, they said. Haha.  Convinced by his talent after an excellent 2022 World Cup with winners Argentina, Chelsea made a big splash in the January transfer window and signed Fernandez for a whopping  £106.8m. Despite his stellar form in Qatar during the winter, eyebrows were ubiquitously raised given the midfielder\\'s relative inexperience of European football.  He\\'d arrived at Benfica just six months prior.  Nevertheless, Fernandez stuck out for all the right reasons during his first few months in west London. He tried his utmost to ensure Chelsea looked competent, but not even he could salvage the Blues.  A controller, playmaker and potentially a final third producer all wrapped into one elegant midfield operator, Fernandez is set to take the Premier League by storm under Mauricio Pochettino at Stamford Bridge. Finding a suitable midfield partner for Fernandez was one of Chelsea\\'s key objectives in the 2023 summer transfer window, and they finally got their man.  Sure, it might\\'ve taken yet another British record fee to acquire their desired midfield target, but Moises Caicedo\\'s potential alongside Fernandez renders the outlay somewhat measured given the tandem\\'s projected dynamic.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Chelsea have triggered the release clause in the contract of Leeds United midfielder Tyler Adams, sources have confirmed to 90min. The Whites were relegated from the Premier League last season, activating a  £20m clause that allows Adams to leave Elland Road if a bidding club is prepared to pay in full. 90min revealed on Monday that Chelsea had contacted the representatives of Adams over a move to west London, and personal terms are now being discussed with the 24-year-old United States international. The Blues have also informed Leeds of their intention to pay Adams' release clause in full, and he is expected to undergo a medical within the next 24 hours. Adams is seen as a shrewd signing by those in charge at Stamford Bridge, who are working to provide manager Mauricio Pochettino with the midfield reinforcements he has publicly requested this summer. feed Chelsea are working on a number of midfield signings and recently launched a bid to rival Liverpool for Southampton midfielder Romeo Lavia, who has been on the Blues' radar for over 12 months now. After Liverpool saw a  £46m bid rejected for Lavia, Chelsea put forward an offer of  £48m, though that remains short of Southampton's  £50m asking price. Chelsea are also continuing to work on an agreement for Brighton midfielder Moises Caicedo, whose  £100m asking price has so far proven problematic. Liverpool have also made late contact with Brighton over potentially rivalling Chelsea's latest offer, which sat at  £80m, but have not progressed talks to the point of making a formal offer.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Manchester United goalkeeper Matej Kovar is on the verge of a permanent transfer away from the club as he undergoes a medical with Bayer Leverkusen, sources have confirmed to 90min. Now 23, Kovar has been with United since the age of 17. He joined from home-town club Solvacko in 2018 and has been loaned out to Swindon Town, Burton Albion and Sparta Prague during that time. It was his loan at Sparta last season that brought Kovar to wider attention. It was his very first year as a top flight starter and he helped the club win the Czech First League and return to the Champions League qualifying rounds. 90min reported in May that Kovar   s form on loan had caught the eye of his parent club. There were glowing reviews coming back from Prague and he was included in the thought process regarding the goalkeeping position long before Andre Onana was eventually signed. At a time when David de Gea was widely expected to sign a new contract at Old Trafford, United staff considered the possibility that Kovar could emerge as the Spaniard   s chief back-up and limit the need to spend big on a new goalkeeper. feed However, De Gea   s contract offer was later withdrawn and revised, ultimately leading to him leaving the club as a free agent. It accelerated the need for a readymade number one and so the club spent handsomely to sign Onana from Inter, reuniting the Cameroonian with Erik ten Hag. Kovar was briefly involved in United   s pre-season programme, playing 135 minutes of the opening two summer friendlies against Leeds and Lyon. But his immediate future now lies elsewhere. 90min understands that a  £7.8m (   9m) transfer fee has been agreed with Bayer Leverkusen and that a medical to complete the transfer is already being undertaken. Ties with Kovar have not been fully cut though, as United have retained a buy-back clause that could see him return to Manchester. Leverkusen finished sixth in the Bundesliga last season following a remarkable turnaround once Xabi Alonso was appointed head coach, having been flirting with relegation initially. It means that Kovar could have the chance to play Europa League football in 2023/24. He will compete with veteran Finland international and current Leverkusen captain Lukas Hradecky.',\n",

Bellingham was Liverpool\\'s top target heading into the summer transfer window but, when the true cost of the deal was set, the Reds ultimately pulled out and Bellingham ended up joining Real Madrid for an initial  £88.5m. Since then, however, Liverpool agreed to the surprise sales of both Jordan Henderson and Fabinho, who moved to Saudi Arabia, and Klopp admitted that unplanned income played a part in the  £111m move for Caicedo. \"I can confirm that the deal with the club is agreed,\" Klopp told a press conference when asked about the Caicedo bid. \"What did change? We are a club, we have not endless resources, we didn\\'t expect a couple of things happening in the summer - Hendo, Fab, stuff like this. We didn\\'t think about this before the summer to be honest, and when it happened, we gave it a go. Obviously the club was really stretched, to be honest.\" feed Klopp went on to insist he knew nothing else about Liverpool\\'s move for Caicedo, stressing he had \"no idea\" whether the Ecuador international was due for a medical on Friday.

Asked whether signing Caicedo would end Liverpool\\'s pursuit of Lavia, Klopp urged fans to wait and see how things play out. \"Let\\'s talk about that if it happens,\" he said. \"It\\'s nothing I can really say, that\\'s the truth. Let\\'s do it step by step, let\\'s see what happens in the next hours or days and then go from there.\"',\n",

       "  'text': 'Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag has insisted the club were \\'professional\\' and followed \\'careful processes\\' in their transfer recruitment this summer. The Red Devils recently completed the signing of Atalanta\\'s Rasmus Hojlund for a fee that could reach  £72m. He is expected to become their starting striker once he returns to full fitness following a back injury, United have had a long-standing interest in Harry Kane, but they did not make any advances to Tottenham Hotspur this summer, and the 30-year-old is now set to join Bayern Munich after the two clubs agreed on an  £86.4m fee. Ahead of Monday\\'s Premier League opener at home to Wolves, Ten Hag was asked about Kane\\'s move to the Bundesliga and Man Utd\\'s own interest - with the Dutchman admitting his exit is a blow to England\\'s top flight. \"I don\\'t think that I have to go into that discussion or give an opinion about that,\" Ten Hag said. \"We are professional, the processes we do are really careful. \"We consider a lot of things but finally we make decisions, we don\\'t take decisions overnight, there is a strategy in every decision behind and we are happy with the squad we have behind us now. feed \"We have chosen a striker and we are really happy with our choice.

Hojlund won\\'t be available for the Red Devils, as he nurses his back injury, and that could put the onus on Marcus Rashford to again score the goals for Ten Hag\\'s side. The 25-year-old scored a career-best 30 in all competitions last season to earn a new five-year contract and status as the highest-paid player at the club.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk has admitted that he understands why fans have \"doubts\" over the club\\'s transfer business this summer.  The Reds made two early splashes in the transfer market this summer by signing Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai for a combined  £95m, which could grow to  £115m with the former\\'s add-ons. Liverpool have largely struggled to get any other deals over the line however, seeing three bids rejected by Southampton for Romeo Lavia and interest in defensive options such as Jurrien Timber fizzle out - with the defender instead joining Arsenal.  Coupled with that, the Reds have also let a huge number of first-team players leave the club, particularly in midfielder as captain Jordan Henderson and vice-captain Fabinho both joined Saudi Pro League teams, and the likes of James Milner, Naby Keita and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain all left as free agents. Long-serving forward Roberto Firmino has also moved on. feed All of this has ultimately led to Liverpool fans being rather unimpressed with the club\\'s transfer business and new club captain Van Dijk admitted that he understands their concerns. \"I can definitely understand it in some ways but I\\'m not a very negative person,\" he said. \"Obviously, when a lot of players are leaving, when your captain and vice-captain is leaving, and at the moment, there are only two incomings. And the way we have been playing, in possession really good but defensively when you concede goals it\\'s not as good, I can understand some people having doubts. \"Let\\'s see if more players are coming in and then we have to be ready again for a long season. It will be very tough if we look at the teams around us, but we want to be up there again, we want to be challenging again.  \"We have to be confident, we should be confident, and we should still be learning each and every day. There have been characters leaving, players who have played a big part in the success, but others have to step up. That\\'s a nice challenge in my opinion. We should be excited.\" The Reds kick-off their 2023/24 Premier League campaign on Sunday against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. ',\n",

United are on the cusp of selling Harry Maguire to West Ham United for  £30m and have identified former Barcelona defender Todibo as a potential replacement for the Englishman. One of the top performers in Ligue 1 last season, Todibo is rated incredibly highly by everyone at Nice, including new manager Farioli, but while the boss wants to keep Todibo, he admitted he could not guarantee no business would be done. \"I also have two vice-captains Khephren Thuram and Jean-Clair Todibo who are among the best players in the team,\" Farioli told the media. \"We would like both players to stay until the end of the season, but you cannot escape the reality of the transfer window. We\\'ll see what happens. As long as they\\'re here, I\\'m enjoying having them.\" feed He continued: \"Of course we would like Todibo to stay, but it can be complicated. We have to wait to see who will want to buy him and if everyone finds an agreement there.  \"He is a leader, a very strong player mentally, he has improved a lot and he is ready to reach the very top level.\" United have drawn up a sizeable list of potential replacements for Maguire. Alongside Todibo, there is also interest in Torino\\'s Perr Schuurs and Everton\\'s Jarrad Branthwaite, while Bayer Leverkusen\\'s Edmond Tapsoba is seen as an expensive alternative. The Red Devils have also been offered the chance to sign versatile Bayern Munich defender Benjamin Pavard, who is in the final year of his contract and is expected to be available for a fee similar to the  £30m United are in line to receive for Maguire.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Arsenal will initially sign Brentford goalkeeper David Raya on a season-long loan with an option to then make the deal permanent in 2024, 90min understands. Raya has made it clear that he is ready to take the next step in his career, with Brentford repeatedly pointing suitors to a  £40m price tag. That figure put Tottenham and Bayern Munich off pursuing a deal, but Arsenal were able to come to a  £30m agreement earlier this week. It isn   t a straight transfer though. 90min understands that the agreement will actually see Raya sign a one-year extension to his Brentford contract so that it then expires in the summer of 2025 instead of at the end of this season     that could have seen him walk away as a free agent. He will then join Arsenal on loan for the duration of the 2023/24 season, rather than outright. At the end of the loan, the Gunners will have an option to make it permanent for the total  £30m already agreed. It is not, however, an obligation to buy. feed That gives Arsenal a get out option should Raya not succeed in establishing himself. In the same breath, should the Spaniard end up returning to Brentford, his value is protected by the contract extension and they would still have the opportunity to command a sizeable transfer fee. The proposed structure of the deal will financially benefit Arsenal, who have already splashed out more than  £200m in transfer fees this summer on Kai Havertz, Jurrien Timber and Declan Rice. Hailing from Barcelona, Raya has spent his entire senior career in English football, having moved from Catalan club Cornella to Blackburn   s academy at the age of 16 almost a decade ago.',\n",

Fred made 56 appearances for United last season, although he was primarily a back-up option and started only 12 times in the Premier League.

The deal negotiated with Fenerbahce is worth  £13m (   15m), inclusive of add-ons.

The Hammers have been exploring how to spend the  £105m earned by Declan Rice\\'s sale to Arsenal and have begun their shopping spree with a move for Alvarez, who 90min understands will set West Ham back around  £34m if all add-ons are met.

To join a club like a West Ham is a dream for me and my family.  \"The Premier League is a special league, the best league in the world and I think my style will suit it. I now have a responsibility to West Ham and the West Ham family and I will give absolutely everything for the shirt.\" feed Manager David Moyes added: \"We   re really pleased to add Edson to our squad.

Arribas joined Madrid from the youth system at city neighbours Leganes back in 2012 and gradually rose through the ranks at Valdebebas. The forward made his first-team debut in September 2020 and had played eight senior games by the end of that campaign, combining duties with Real Madrid Castilla. Arribas spent the entirety of 2021/22 with the reserve team, before reappearing for the first-team in 2022/23. He even scored his first goal in the FIFA Club World Cup against Al Ahly of Egypt. With Real Madrid Castilla last season, Arribas scored 18 goals in 34 appearances. Madrid are yet to replace Karim Benzema and have also let Mariano Diaz leave, but 21-year-old Arribas won   t be used to plug the attacking holes in the squad. He has now signed a long-term contract with Almeria until the summer of 2029. In their first top flight campaign since 2015, Almeria narrowly avoided relegation last season.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Juventus\\' training match against Juventus Next Gen was interrupted on Wednesday by a pitch invasion which saw supporters protest a possible move for Chelsea striker Romelu Lukaku. The clubs have spoken this summer about a possible deal for Lukaku which would also see Dusan Vlahovic head to Stamford Bridge, but while Chelsea appreciate the Serbian striker, 90min understands they have a huge issue with Juve\\'s demand for an extra  £35m as part of the deal. These negotiations came after Lukaku\\'s proposed return to Inter collapsed when the Italian side learned of talks between Juventus and the Belgian, who had privately and publicly vowed never to play for any Serie A side other than Inter. As a result, Lukaku\\'s proposed move to the Allianz Stadium has not gone down well among fans, many of whom were heard screaming \"No, we don\\'t want Lukaku\" during Wednesday\\'s friendly - chants which initially began in the stands during the first minute of the game. It\\'s worth noting that this game between Juventus and Juventus Next Gen took the place of the annual Villar Perosa friendly, in which it is tradition for fans to invade the pitch. But while the event is usually full of positivity as fans get the chance to meet players, a large number of supporters chose to use the opportunity to oppose a move for Lukaku instead. Invasione (anche senza Villar Perosa) #Juve pic.twitter.com/zpGsQcm7Ko Sources have confirmed to 90min that Chelsea are no longer entertaining the idea of a swap deal between Lukaku and Vlahovic as they do not share Juventus\\' valuation of the latter, but the Blues are still open to a straight sale if the right bid arrives for Lukaku. Options for Lukaku, who rejected an approach from Saudi Arabia earlier this summer, are proving limited after Inter closed the door on a potential transfer. \"Given what Inter has done for him, we expected him to behave differently, as a professional and as a man,\" Inter vice-president Javier Zanetti told La Gazzetta dello Sport. \"He has the right to go where he wants, of course, but he could have told us that beforehand. Nobody is bigger than the club and when building a team, you always have to consider who you are bringing into the dressing room.\"',\n",

       "  'text': \"Kylian Mbappe has reiterated his desire to stay with Paris Saint-Germain and see out the remainder of his contract in the French capital, 90min understands. The 24-year-old shocked PSG earlier this summer when he told them he would not be exercising the option to extend his contract, which is set to expire in June next year. PSG have responded by trying to sell Mbappe this summer, in a desperate bid to avoid losing one of the world's best players on a free transfer, but he has made it clear on numerous occasions that he intends to leave next year as a free agent. The Ligue 1 giants even accepted a world record offer of  £257m (   300m) from Al Hilal last month, but despite putting forward a gargantuan contract offer to Mbappe, the PIF-backed Saudi Pro League side were unable to persuade the World Cup Golden Boot winner to enter negotiations. Chelsea have also been contracted by PSG in a bid to drum up further interest in Mbappe, as have a number of other heavyweight European clubs. Mbappe was left out of PSG's recent pre-season tour of Japan and has been banished from first-team duties as the dispute between player and club rages on - sources have told 90min that club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi has even warned Fayza Lamari, his mother and agent, that Mbappe will 'not put a PSG shirt on again.' manual Despite the hostile atmopshere, Mbappe's position on the matter remains unchanged. 90min understands that he intends to spend the next 12 months in Paris before moving on to his next venture, which many believe will be at Real Madrid, and he has informed PSG of his plan. Sources close to Mbappe and Real Madrid have vehemently denied that an agreement is already in place for him to move to the Spanish capital next summer, but he came within a whisker of joining Madrid in 2022 before a last-minute change of heart saw him sign a new contract at PSG. Mbappe's sidelining is part of a radical overhaul at PSG this summer. Lionel Messi has already departed for Inter Miami, while the Parisiens are also keen to ship out Neymar. He has interest in his services from Saudi Arabia, with a potential return to Barcelona also rumoured in recent weeks.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Barcelona are not concerned about losing midfielder Ilkay Gundogan over a registration clause in his contract, 90min understands. Gundogan joined on a free transfer from Manchester City this summer, inking a two-year contract which also includes an option for the midfielder to terminate his deal if he is not registered in Barcelona's squad by the time the new La Liga season kicks off this weekend. Financial restrictions mean Barcelona have not yet registered any of their new singings - Gundogan, Oriol Romeu, Inigo Martinez - as well as any new contracts agreed this summer and the return of loanees like Ez Abde and Fermin Lopez.  As it stands, manager Xavi has just 13 eligible players for the season-opener against Getafe on 13 August, including Ousmane Dembele and Franck Kessie, who are on the cusp of leaving the club. The imminent sales of Dembele and Kessie, to Paris Saint-Germain and Al Ahli respectively, are expected to net Barcelona around    65m ( £56m), while talks are also on over a 16% sale of Barca Studios which would provide another cash injection. feed Sources have confirmed to 90min that Barcelona are confident they will wrap up their outstanding deals in time to register Gundogan and the rest of their new signings before the new season gets underway. As was the case with Gavi earlier this summer when the midfielder's contract extension was delayed, Gundogan is not causing problems behind the scene and is not contemplating an early exit from Camp Nou. While Barcelona understand their current situation, sources close to the club insist they are confident they have the financial capacity to register all their new signings - a stance exemplified by ongoing efforts to sign Manchester City duo Bernardo Silva and Joao Cancelo. Gundogan and the rest of Barcelona's new signings can be registered up to and including the day of the Getafe game, and club officials are optimistic everything will be finalised in time.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Arsenal have rejected a  £30m bid from Ligue 1 side Monaco for Folarin Balogun, sources have confirmed to 90min. Balogun returned to the Gunners during the summer after a successful loan spell with Reims in which the forward managed a stunning 21 goals in Ligue 1 for the mid-table team. Despite expectations being high among Gunners fans upon his return to the Emirates, the striker barely featured during a pre-season riddled with injury concerns. Even without a dismal pre-season with Arsenal, Balogun has long been expected to leave the club once again this summer but this time permanently - the player himself stated in June that he \"definitely\" would not go out on loan again. The USMNT international has also consistently rejected the opportunity to enter talks over a new contract at the Emirates Stadium due to the lack of guarantees of game time.  90min reported in July that this resistance to signing a new deal, and unwillingness to go out on loan, has led to Arsenal slapping a  £50m price tag on the striker. feed Crystal Palace, West Ham United, Brentford, Fulham and UEFA Champions League finalists Inter have all been in contact regarding the player\\'s services, but sources have now confirmed to 90min that Monaco are the first to table an offer.  The Ligue 1 club have made an opening bid of  £30m which has been swiftly reject by the Gunners, who are holding firm on their  £50m price tag.  Monaco have stepped up their efforts to sign a new striker following Breel Embolo\\'s ACL injury during a pre-season game. The ailment will see the Swiss forward miss the bulk of the 2023/24 campaign, making the signing of a new starting calibre striker a priority for the principality club.  Along with Balogun, 90min understands that Gift Orban of Gent and reported Chelsea and West Ham target Elye Wahi have also been shortlisted by Monaco. Both forwards have recently held talks with representatives of Tottenham Hotspur.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Liverpool have agreed a British record deal worth  £111m to sign Brighton midfielder Moises Caicedo, 90min understands. The Reds opened talks with Brighton on Thursday as they pivoted from Southampton's Romeo Lavia to Caicedo and now terms are agreed between the two clubs. Caicedo had been Chelsea's prime midfield target all summer, but they baulked at the idea of meeting Brighton's value - which has always been at least  £100m - while Liverpool's offer of  £111m was immediately accepted. Such a deal would represent a British record, eclipsing the  £106m Chelsea paid to land Enzo Fernandez in January. Chelsea made numerous offers for Caicedo, but their highest did not exceed  £80m and now they have missed out on the Ecuador star who is destined for Anfield, where he will help form an overhauled midfield containing Hungarian star Dominik Szoboszlai and former Seagulls teammate Alexis Mac Allister. feed Caicedo is now due to head to Merseyside to complete his medical and is expected to sign his contract before this weekend's Premier League opener, which just so happens to come against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Sunday. For Liverpool, the deal is an obvious club record, eclipsing the  £75m paid to sign centre-back Virgil van Dijk from Southampton in January 2018. While such an expensive move was not initially on the cards this summer, Liverpool raised significant funds through the unplanned sales of Jordan Henderson and Fabinho to Saudi Arabia and ultimately decided to pull the trigger. As for Chelsea, the Blues joined the bidding for Liverpool target Lavia earlier this week as they submitted a  £48m offer for the Southampton midfielder, who has been valued at  £50m. Chelsea have also confirmed their intention to trigger the  £20m release clause of Leeds United midfielder Tyler Adams.\",\n",

The German champions have been looking to add another stopper to their ranks while Manuel Neuer continues his recovery from a broken leg that he suffered during a skiing trip back in December. They had previously looked at Brentford's David Raya, but like Tottenham Hotspur refused to match the  £40m valuation. The Bees have since agreed to sell him to Arsenal for  £30m. With Yann Sommer signing for Inter in recent days, Bayern are stepping up their pursuit of a new goalkeeper. 90min understands they have made an enquiry to Chelsea regarding Kepa. feed The Blues are open to selling their current number one, who has two years left to run on his contract at Stamford Bridge, but Bayern's interest has not gone beyond this initial enquiry. Chelsea have brought in a goalkeeper of their own this transfer window, signing Robert Sanchez from Brighton for a fee in the region of  £20m. 90min understands that Bayern are also considering making a contract offer to free agent De Gea, who has been without a club since July after leaving Manchester United. De Gea also has suitors in the Saudi Pro League and it remains to be seen whether he would turn down such lucrative offers to join Bayern as a backup.

After David de Gea\\'s departure on a free transfer, United began looking for two new goalkeepers and were reported to have lined up 20-year-old Suzuki, then of Japanese side Urawa Red Diamonds, as a possible backup to new number one Andre Onana. Suzuki had other plans, however, taking his talents to Belgium and joining Sint-Truiden on loan with a view to a permanent transfer next summer. While Suzuki admitted he would love to play for United in future, he confessed that he did not want to sit on the bench behind  £47.2m signing Onana. feed \"I decided to transfer this time as a step up in aiming to be the best in the world. It\\'s true that there was an offer from Manchester United,\" Suzuki told the media. \"As a football player and as a person, if I hadn\\'t thought about anything, of course, I would like to go to Manchester United, but among them, I really want to spend time thinking about what kind of future awaits me. After much thought, I made this decision. \"Manchester United have acquired Onana. It\\'s important for me to participate in matches, and I think it is also important to play on the world stage. I want to make the most of what I have learned here and do my best.\" Despite his initial rejection, Suzuki confirmed he dreams of making the move to the Premier League and flying the flag for his country. \"While many players are active overseas, it is difficult to become a keeper,\" he concluded. \"I think we are going to have a really tough battle ahead of us in that position. \"There are still no Japanese who are active as goalkeepers in the Premier League, so I want to be one of the first players to do so.

Bayern Munich have had three bids for Kane knocked back by Spurs already this transfer window and are preparing a fourth worth  £94.6m (   110m). However, 90min understands that Tottenham have showed no indication that this will be enough to convince them to sell their star striker, who has less than a year left to run on his contract. 90min revealed on Tuesday that Kane would like his future sorted before the start of the new Premier League campaign - if he is still at Tottenham by the time they face Brentford on Sunday, he is happy to stay put for the entirety of 2023/24. Tottenham remain hopeful they can convince Kane to commit his long-term future to the club and he has been impressed by new head coach Ange Postecoglou following his appointment in June. Though Spurs are adamant that Kane will not be allowed to leave, they have brought in a new centre forward in Argentina youth international Alejo Veliz this week and could yet sign another this summer. feed Sources have told 90min that representatives of Spurs have sounded out several other strikers regarding potential moves to north London. 21-year-old Gent forward Gift Orban, who has scored a staggering 22 goals in 24 games since joining the Belgian club last year, is one target that Tottenham have spoken to. Chelsea target Elye Wahi of Montpellier and Lille star Jonathan David are also on Spurs' radar, as is wantaway Fulham talisman Aleksandar Mitrovic, who saw a proposed move to Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal fall through earlier this summer. Mitrovic was keen on a move to Saudi Arabia but Al Hilal failed to stump up more than  £30m, with Fulham demanding closer to  £50m for the Serbia international. Beyond Kane and Veliz, Brazil's starting number nine Richarlison is also on Tottenham's books and has enjoyed a fruitful pre-season under Postecoglou.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Brighton CEO Paul Barber says the club hopes to hold onto Chelsea target Moises Caicedo and \"understands\" the current interest in the Ecuador international. Caicedo has become one of the best midfielders in the Premier League during his time at the AMEX and attracted interest from both the Blues and Arsenal during the January transfer window. The midfielder asked to leave but Brighton stood firm and have maintained their not-for-sale stance during the summer so far. The youngster is said to have skipped training recently in a bid to force through a move to Stamford Bridge and wasn\\'t involved in Brighton\\'s final pre-season friendly of the summer against Rayo Vallecano. 90min understands Brighton have told Caicedo they will not sell him unless their  £100m valuation is met. Chelsea are still chasing the 21-year-old and Barber insisted the south coast side do not want him to leave this year. feed He said: \"For a young player like Moises at 21, he\\'s probably one of the best midfield players in the world already at his age, and we\\'ve had a fantastic time working with him. And we want it to continue, we\\'ve got him under a long contract. \"We\\'re also realistic to know there is interest in him. As a young man, that interest is inevitably going to have an impact on your thought process and unsettle you a little bit. We understand that. \"But for now, he\\'s a Brighton player, he\\'s under contract. We expect him to work hard, prepare for the new season and we\\'ll see what happens as the window goes on. \"The window\\'s got a long way to go, we\\'d love to keep him. He\\'s a really important player, we\\'ll see where we are.\" Brighton lost Leandro Trossard to Arsenal in January and have also sold Alexis Mac Allister and Robert Sanchez to Liverpool and Chelsea this window respectively. However, they have responded with incoming deals for Joao Pedro, Mahmoud Dahoud, James Milner, Bart Verbruggen and Igor Julio. A club-record  £34.5m deal has also been agreed with Ajax for Ghana forward Mohammed Kudus, though an agreement over personal terms still hasn\\'t been reached.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Barcelona manager Xavi has responded to rumours linking Neymar with a sensational return to Catalonia this summer.  The Brazilian superstar has been heavily linked with a move away from current club Paris Saint-Germain, with 90min recently revealing that the Ligue 1 giants are working hard to try and move the forward on.  Signed for a world record fee of  £190m (   222m) back in 2017, Neymar has largely disappointed during his time in Ligue 1 due to a myriad of injury concerns. The 31-year-old has never played more than 22 league games in any given season during his six year spell in Paris, and has failed to win the club their first ever UEFA Champions League - being on the losing end in the 2020 final.  Neymar enjoyed a much more successful stint at Barca between 2013 and 2017, winning the Champions League and two La Liga titles as an integral member of the famed \\'MSN\\' frontline.  In light of PSG\\'s interest in selling the player, Neymar has inevitably been linked with a return to his former club Barcelona. 90min understands that club president Joan Laporta is keen to re-sign Neymar, however manager Xavi would prefer if the club targeted Manchester City star Bernardo Silva.  feed Speaking to the press after Barcelona\\'s 4-2 win over Tottenham Hotspur in the Joan Gamper Trophy on Tuesday evening, Xavi was asked about the links with Neymar, saying: \"I cannot say anything more about Neymar. Last year I had mentioned a name of a player from another team and that club got angry. From here until the end of the market, we will see.\" Xavi also commented on the need for Barca to bulk their squad further this summer, telling reporters: \"We have to strengthen ourselves well. The sports area and the president know this reality. I\\'m happy with how our players are training and our pre-season.\" Barcelona are likely to face stiff competition from PIF owned Saudi Pro League clubs and potentially Newcastle United, depending on the future direction the club\\'s owners in regards to transfer policy.',\n",

The Blues are looking to bring in a couple of midfielders this month to bolster Mauricio Pochettino's options and Lavia has emerged as one of their prime targets. Chelsea are already in talks with Brighton & Hove Albion over Moises Caicedo and have seen a number of bids for him rejected, but 90min understands that, while those talks are continuing, they have now also made a move for Lavia. Chelsea have long been interested in Lavia, with their interest driven by their co-director of recruitment and talent Joe Shields - the man who took Lavia to Southampton in 2023. feed Southampton, who have agreed to sell their captain James Ward-Prowse to West Ham Untied for  £30m, are demanding  £50m for Belgian starlet Lavia and Chelsea's offer is short of that at  £48m, but it is the largest bid they have received so far this summer. Liverpool have been in pole position for Lavia, but they have seen three bids for the teenager rejected, with their latest offer for the 19-year-old being worth  £45m. Sources believe that Southampton are now more than confident that their  £50m asking price will be met by one of Lavia's suitors and they won't be accepting less.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Real Madrid are preparing to move for Sevilla goalkeeper Yassine Bounou, 90min understands, as they look to cover the long-term absence of Thibaut Courtois. The Belgian suffered an ACL injury during a training session earlier this week and will soon undergo surgery, which will keep him on the sidelines for the vast majority of the 2023/24 La Liga season. With Ukraine international Andriy Lunin the only other goalkeeper in Carlo Ancelotti's squad, Madrid are prepared to enter the transfer market for a new stopper and have identified a number of potential targets. Contact has been made with former Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea, while Chelsea's Kepa Arrizabalaga is also seen as a candidate for a loan move, but sources have confirmed to 90min that Bounou is at the top of Madrid's wish list. 32-year-old Bounou, who excelled with Morocco at the World Cup, has made 157 appearances in La Liga across his career, emerging as one of the division's most-reliable stoppers since his switch to Sevilla in 2020. feed 90min understands that Bounou has made it clear he would like the chance to move to Madrid and Sevilla are prepared to do business for a fee of around    20m ( £17.3m). Madrid were not planning to do any additional business after an expensive shopping spree which brought Jude Bellingham, Arda Guler, Fran Garcia and Joselu to the club, but Courtois' serious injury has forced them back into the market. While club officials are understood to be fans of Lunin, there is a desire to bring in a goalkeeper with more La Liga experience as Ancelotti seeks to wrestle the league title back from rivals Barcelona. Defence was a real issue for Ancelotti during pre-season, with the Spanish side conceding eight goals across four games, and the injury to Courtois has only complicated his attempted solution.\",\n",

Walker's current deal is due to expire at the end of the 2023/24 season but this will be extended to 2025 with new terms. And the news continues to be positive at Man City as their similarly firm stance on Silva looks set to pay off. feed Silva has been looking to leave the club and there have been no shortage of suitors, with Barcelona pushing hard to sign a player who had long been eyeing a move to Catalonia. PSG were ready to pay Man City their asking price of around  £80m this summer, but Silva has been told he will not be allowed to leave. While Silva is keen to move on from Man City and has recently reiterated that desire to Guardiola, sources have told 90min that he is accepting there is little chance of any club being able to persuade them to sell. Silva's current deal runs to 2025, which means Man City are not under pressure to sanction a transfer, and because of that a new contract is now close to being finalised. As 90min previously revealed, Man City are willing to make Silva one of the best-paid players at the club and in the Premier League altogether, putting him close to the wage packets of teammates Erling Haaland and Kevin De Bruyne. Man City believe and hope that both Silva and Walker will put pen-to-paper on their new deals by the end of this month.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Manchester United are set to enter the transfer market to sign a new centre-back following the completion of Harry Maguire's  £30m move to West Ham, 90min understands. Maguire is in discussions over a move to east London after being made available for transfer this summer by Erik ten Hag, who has already stripped the 30-year-old of the United captaincy. Maguire had initially wanted to stay and fight for his place but is now likely to proceed with his Old Trafford departure after talks between the clubs progressed this week. The England international arrived in 2019 for  £80m, a world record transfer fee for a defender, but has suffered a difficult four years under successive managers Ten Hag, Ralf Rangnick and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. He has lost his place entirely in the team under the Dutchman, who has not deemed Maguire suitable to execute the style of football he'd like to implement in Manchester. It had been part of Ten Hag's long-term plan to phase out and replace Maguire, despite his public suggestions otherwise, and now his departure is nearing completion, United are exploring names to replace his position in the squad. They have been offered Benjamin Pavard, a French World Cup winner who has been looking to leave Bayern Munich for the duration of the summer. He would carry the added bonus of being able to cover at right-back should he swap southern Germany for north west England. Bayern are open to letting Pavard leave and he'd likely cost United in the region of what they'd receive for Maguire. feed Nice centre-back Jean-Clair Todibo is a younger alternative at a similar price under consideration, while Liverpool target Perr Schuurs, now of Torino but formerly of Ten Hag's Ajax, is also liked behind the scenes. Everton's Jarrad Branthwaite is another central defender United have been following. Edmond Tapsoba, a Tottenham target who plays for Bayer Leverkusen, represents a more expensive option if United choose to go down that route, though it remains to be seen at present how much they are prepared to outlay and how ambitious they'd like to be with their replacement. Benfica's Antonio Silva is understood to be loved by club scouts but potentially the most expensive of those named. The club are looking to raise funds through the sales of a number of squad players - not just that of Maguire - and are close to moving Fred out of Old Trafford, with several parties interested in the Brazilian. Donny van de Beek is also set to depart for Real Sociedad in the coming weeks, with United pushing for a permanent deal, while Scott McTominay is still of interest to West Ham, who are now threatened by interest from Manchester City in Lucas Paqueta.\",\n",

At the same time, Lavia remains a real option for both Chelsea and Liverpool.

       "  'text': 'Jurgen Klopp is never shy in expressing his vehement distaste for numerous aspects of modern football\\'s calendar. Whether it\\'s Saturday lunchtime kick-offs or England\\'s festive fixture list, the Liverpool manager is quick to voice his criticism. The latest scheduling conflict to irk Klopp has been the closing date of the Saudi Pro League\\'s summer transfer window. \"I think pretty much the worst thing is that the transfer window in Saudi Arabia is three weeks longer open,\" Klopp argued ahead of the new Premier League season. \"That\\'s not helpful. So there must be, UEFA, FIFA must find solutions for that.\" Klopp knows the power that the Pro League wields better than most after watching two of his starting midfielders Jordan Henderson and Fabinho move to the Middle East this summer. Here\\'s exactly when the Saudi Pro League transfer window closes and how it compares to its European counterparts. Much like most European divisions and northern hemisphere leagues in general, the Saudi Pro League transfer window began on 1 July. Before the window had even officially opened, Saudi clubs had begun to reshape the transfer market with the earth-shattering arrival of Karim Benzema at top-flight champions Al Ittihad. While Cristiano Ronaldo\\'s move to Al Nassr last December was ground-breaking, the acquisition of the reigning Ballon d\\'Or winner was a statement move. There is still plenty of time for many more. The Saudi Arabian sports ministry has put aside around $800m ( £628m) for transfers to the top flight this summer, per the New York Times. The newly expanded 18-team league has until 20 September to splurge this hulking mass of capital. According to the detailed report in the New York Times, Saudi clubs were each provided with numerous transfer recommendations at the start of the window alongside a set of ground rules to prevent inter-league competition for players. During the seismic off-season, Saudi clubs have spent around  £350m to recruit the likes of Benzema, former Manchester City winger Riyad Mahrez and Sadio Mane from Bayern Munich. No team among Europe\\'s supposed elite has proven capable of matching the financial might from the Middle East. The Saudi Pro League\\'s chief operating officer Carlo Nohra explained to Reuters: \"We had to improve quality and in order to improve quality, you have to bring in the best. Spending was always going to be an essential component for us to do this.\" manual Klopp\\'s outburst was underpinned by the disparity between the closing dates of the transfer windows in England and Saudi Arabia. While the Pro League can continue to tempt players away with lucrative deals until the fourth week of September, the Premier League\\'s transfer window slams (it never closes quietly) shut on 1 September at 23:00 BST. When both windows are open, Premier League clubs can at least source replacements for the individuals that chased gold to the Gulf. Yet, there are 19 long days for Saudi sides to pilfer England\\'s helpless top flight. According to FIFA\\'s Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players, transfer windows are determined by each association. World football\\'s governing body stipulates that there must be two registration periods (summer and winter windows) and the first \"shall begin on the first day of the season. This period may not exceed 12 weeks.\" The 2023/24 season begins on 1 July 2023 for most leagues which run from autumn to spring. Therefore, the latest that the summer window could close would be on 23 September 2023. The Saudi Pro League have simply stretched the window to its limits while the Premier League plays by the same rules as the rest of Europe. League Closing date / time (BST) La Liga 01/09/2023 - 23:00 Serie A 01/09/2023 - 19:00 Bundesliga 01/09/2023 - 17:00 Ligue 1 01/09/2023 - 22:00 This year, all of the major European leagues will also close at varying times on 1 September. The Premier League voted to close their summer window in 2018 and 2019 when the season\\'s fixtures began during August, theoretically providing every manager with a settled squad for each match in the first half of the campaign. However, the rest of Europe didn\\'t follow suit, giving those on the continent ample opportunity to poach Premier League stars without any chance of retaliation. After two years, Premier League clubs voted to get back \"in sync\" with the rest of Europe. Now, the continent\\'s elite teams are out of step with the Saudi Pro League - which has already spent more on transfers than La Liga. Whether this will lead to an extension of future summer windows remains to be seen. But there will be no solution for a grumpy Klopp this year.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Tottenham Hotspur head coach Ange Postecoglou has admitted that Harry Kane was \\'unlikely\\' to stay at the club this season ahead of his move to Bayern Munich. 90min reported on Thursday that Spurs had finally relented and accepted an  £86.4m (   100m) bid from the German champions. Kane will fly to Germany on Friday to finalise the transfer. Spurs boss Postecoglou insisted last week that he simply wanted the saga resolved as soon as possible to plan for the season ahead. Ahead of Sunday\\'s trip to Brentford for his Premier League debut, Postecoglou was understandably asked for an update on Kane. \"It\\'s fair to say I don\\'t have a blow by blow account of the whole thing but fair to say it\\'s progressed to the point where it looks like it\\'s going to happen. We move forward without Harry. It gives us clarity and unless something unforeseen happens we\\'ll move on,\" he said. \"I didn\\'t see the point in [pitching myself] because whatever I was going to say was going to be irrelevant. I could plan his grand vision but I\\'m sure he\\'d heard it all before. My feeling was we\\'ll get to know each other, that\\'s the best way to navigate this early bit. Having said that, in my mind after that initial conversation [on the first day], he\\'d made up his mind that if the clubs agreed he\\'d go but he was also happy to stay if they didn\\'t. \"It\\'s best Harry speaks for himself on the decision but there\\'s no doubts he\\'s one of the greats of this football club. His record speaks for himself. I\\'m only new in the building but I\\'m certainly not the spokesman for this football club in declaring people\\'s status but I think it\\'s clear Harry Kane is one of the greats. \"I think if you\\'re involved in football as long as I have, you know clubs are not going to talk to each other without the player knowing. We weren\\'t talking to Wolfsburg without knowing Micky van de Ven wanted to come. \"[Harry and I] had a chat on the first day. He was up front and honest that if they could agree a deal then he would go. He wanted it decided by the first game and that was my preference as well.\" manual When asked how Tottenham will go about replacing Kane, Postecoglou added: \"I don\\'t think there\\'s a like for like replacement for Harry. We\\'ve been planning for this for a while to be fair. It doesn\\'t take too much investigative work to know that this was going to happen. Our business up to now reflects that. \"I don\\'t think it works that way [giving Daniel Levy a list of strikers to get]. It\\'s not like the family shopping list to go and get milk and bread for the kids. My whole strategy has been that Harry was unlikely to be around so it wasn\\'t like we had a pow wow this morning.\" 90min revealed earlier this week that Spurs representatives had touched base with other forwards, including Gent starlet Gift Orban.',\n",

Ahead of West Ham\\'s Premier League season opener away to Bournemouth, Moyes was asked for the latest on the saga. \"We\\'ve had a bid accepted from Manchester United, but while he\\'s not our player I\\'m not in a position to discuss him,\" he replied. feed While Maguire has not officially left the club yet, 90min understands Man Utd are stepping up plans to bring in a replacement centre-back. Bayern Munich\\'s Benjamin Pavard has been offered to the Red Devils and has made it clear in recent months that he wants to continue his playing career at centre-back as opposed to right-back. Nice\\'s Jean-Clair Todibo, Everton\\'s Jarrad Branthwaite, Torino\\'s Perr Schuurs and Bayer Leverkusen\\'s Edmond Tapsoba are all on Man Utd\\'s shortlist. Maguire was stripped of the club captaincy this summer and removed entirely from Man Utd\\'s leadership group, with Bruno Fernandes being promoted to skipper. West Ham, meanwhile, have finally made some movement in the transfer market after a quiet summer window. They recently completed the signing of Ajax midfielder Edson Alvarez, with Southampton captain James Ward-Prowse set to follow.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp admits his previous comments on heavy spending were wrong  in the wake of the Reds\\'  £111m agreement to sign Moises Caicedo from Brighton. Caicedo is set to become the most expensive signing in the history of English football after Liverpool agreed to pay Brighton  £111m to sign the midfielder, but critics were quick to recall Klopp\\'s previous criticisms of such heavy spending. Indeed, in 2016, Klopp was left stunned by Manchester United\\'s  £89m acquisition of Paul Pogba - a world record at the time - and vowed he would never pull the trigger on such a deal. \"The day that this is football, I\\'m not in a job anymore, because the game is about playing together,\" Klopp said at the time. \"Other clubs can go out and spend more money and collect top players. I want to do it differently. I would even do it differently if I could spend that money.\" feed Having now agreed to sign Caicedo for  £111m in the same summer as Dominik Szoboszlai and Alexis Mac Allister moved to Liverpool for a combined  £95m, Klopp confessed the market has been thrown into turmoil since his comments on Pogba. \"Everything changed,\" he told a press conference on Friday. \"Do I like it? No, but did I realise I was wrong? Definitely. Definitely. That\\'s the way it goes. It\\'s not great, it\\'s not top. Saudi Arabia will not help with that. I\\'m not blaming it, but another market with a lot of money. \"In the end, we as a club, we have to try make sure that we, with our resources, get the best possible team together. We try everything to bring together the best squad for us, and we are not in dreamland, so it\\'s not like we can just point at players and bring them in. \"If people want to throw my quotes from five or six years ago at me, no problem. That\\'s what I thought that day, and I realise now I was wrong, easy to admit that.\"',\n",

       "  'text': \"West Ham United have agreed a  £30m deal with Southampton for their captain James Ward-Prowse, sources have confirmed to 90min. The Hammers have been desperately trying to strengthen their squad after selling Declan Rice to Arsenal in a British-record  £105m transfer. Things have been slow moving for West Ham, amid internal conflicts between manager David Moyes and new technical director Tim Steidten, but progress has been made over the past 48 hours on a number of targets. Edson Alvarez has completed a medical in London ahead of a  £34m move from Ajax, while West Ham have also agreed a  £30m fee for former Manchester United skipper Harry Maguire - he is now due to discuss personal terms over a move to the East End. And sources have confirmed to 90min that after lengthy negotiations, West Ham have agreed a  £30m deal with Southampton for Ward-Prowse, with an additional sell-on clause, having seen a bid for the same amount rejected by United for Scott McTominay. feed It had looked as though West Ham's move for central midfielder Ward-Prowse would fall through, with Southampton wanting more money for the 28-year-old, but terms have now been agreed between the two parties ahead of the opening weekend of the Premier League season. It's expected he will sign a four-year contract should he come through a medical unscathed. Ward-Prowse has been at Southampton for the entirety of his career, making 422 appearances on the south coast and scoring 55 goals. He has also provided 55 assists in that time, while his unerring accuracy from free-kicks has drawn comparisons to David Beckham. West Ham hope to complete deals for half a dozen players before the summer window closes, with attention now set to turn to strengthening in the wide forward areas and with a striker.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Chelsea are refusing to give up their pursuit of Brighton midfielder Moises Caicedo, 90min understands, despite seeing Liverpool agree a fee for the Ecuador international. The Blues failed with an  £80m offer and were considering returning with a bid closer to Brighton's  £100m asking price when Liverpool swooped in and agreed a British record deal worth  £111m to sign the 21-year-old. Nothing has been signed between Brighton and Liverpool, however, and sources have confirmed to 90min that Chelsea are refusing to accept defeat in the race. Chelsea have informed Caicedo's representatives that they are prepared to battle to try and sign the midfielder and will not give up hope until he has put pen to paper on a deal with Liverpool. As it stands, Chelsea have not made a new bid for Caicedo, with Liverpool the only side to have seen an offer accepted. Before Liverpool's offer arrived, 90min understood that Caicedo's preference was to join Chelsea this summer, with the midfielder repeatedly making it clear to Brighton that he wanted to be allowed to speak to the Blues. feed Caicedo has not yet travelled to Merseyside for a scheduled medical, 90min further understands, and Chelsea are using the time to try and work on a solution. Brighton are hoping to sell Caicedo to the highest bidder and wasted little time in accepting Liverpool's offer, which was significantly higher than any proposal put forward until now by Chelsea. The two clubs, who ironically meet in their opening Premier League fixture on Sunday, have also butted heads  over Southampton midfielder Romeo Lavia. The Reds failed with three bids for the Belgian, the last of which was worth  £46m, before Chelsea arrived with an offer of  £48m. Southampton value Lavia at  £50m and are not prepared to compromise on their price. Where Caicedo ends up remains to be seen, but the twists and turns of the transfer have made it one of the most fascinating sagas of what's been an extraordinary window to date.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Manchester United have agreed to sell Harry Maguire to West Ham United for a  £30m fee, sources have confirmed to 90min. The England international was removed from his position as club captain last month, with Bruno Fernandes taking over the role at Old Trafford. 90min revealed on Monday that West Ham had made a  £30m bid for Maguire with his long-term future at United uncertain, but the bid was turned down at the time. Part of the reason why United knocked back this offer was the belief that the Hammers would be unable to satisfy Maguire's wage demands, but after West Ham informed the Red Devils on Wednesday their willingness to amend their contract offer to the centre-back, the two clubs have come to an agreement. Though Maguire has not been 100% convinced of leaving Man Utd this transfer window, 90min understands he is open to a move and it looks likely that he will now accept West Ham's offer. feed Should Maguire complete a move to London Stadium, United will make a  £50m loss on the 30-year-old following his world-record move from Leicester City in 2019 which made him the most expensive defender in football history. Maguire fell out of favour under Erik ten Hag last season, with Lisandro Martinez displacing him from the starting lineup and often featuring alongside Raphael Varane. Victor Lindelof has also usurped Maguire in the pecking order, with Luke Shaw also preferred in a central role at times. West Ham remain interested in Man Utd midfielder Scott McTominay, who was also the subject of a  £30m bid this week, but the Red Devils are continuing to hold out for a higher fee for the Scotland international. Ajax's Edson Alvarez is close to finalising a move to east London, - he's undergone a medical and is set to pen a five-year deal - while West Ham have also agreed to pay Southampton  £30m for their captain James Ward-Prowse - a move that may prevent an improved offer being made for McTominay.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Liverpool have held talks over potentially trumping Chelsea's latest offer for Brighton midfielder Moises Caicedo, 90min understands. Chelsea have seen multiple bids for Caicedo rejected already this summer, with Brighton holding out for  £100m. While talks between the two sides remain on, Chelsea have also stepped up their pursuit of potential alternatives. Indeed, a bid was recently lodged for Southampton midfielder Romeo Lavia - the subject of three failed offers from Liverpool. With Chelsea threatening to hijack the pursuit of Lavia, sources have confirmed to 90min that Liverpool have made a late move over potentially beating Mauricio Pochettino's side to Caicedo. Sources have stressed that Liverpool have not yet submitted a formal offer for Caicedo but have held talks with Brighton as they explore a possible move to exceed Chelsea's  £80m proposal. feed 90min understands that Caicedo's preference would be to join Chelsea over Liverpool, but it remains to be seen whether that stance would change if the Reds see an offer accepted. Chelsea sources insist that the Blues remain well in the fight for Caicedo as well as Lavia, with Leeds United's Tyler Adams another target on the table. Liverpool are desperate to continue bolstering their midfield after the surprise departures of Jordan Henderson and Fabinho to Saudi Arabia, and Jurgen Klopp's side have spent a large part of the summer focused on Lavia. Three bids have been knocked back by Southampton, the latest of which was worth around  £46m, and Chelsea have moved to try and win the race for Lavia with an offer of  £48m -  £2m short of the Saints'  £50m asking price.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"West Ham United do not intend to sell Lucas Paqueta despite Manchester City making a verbal offer of  £70m for the Brazilian, sources have confirmed to 90min. The 25-year-old established himself as a key player in David Moyes' side during the second half of last season, helping the club to a famous win over Fiorentina in the Europa Conference League final. But despite that success, and West Ham's subsequent qualification for the Europa League, Paqueta wasn't overly impressed with how the 2022/23 season went, with 90min exclusively revealing in June that the Brazilian has particular concerns about working under Moyes. Paqueta has had to adapt his style of play to fit into Moyes' system, and although his performance levels significantly improved after the winter World Cup in Qatar, it's clear that the Brazilian's natural instincts are compromised by West Ham sitting deep and looking to hit teams on the counter. The former AC Milan and Lyon midfielder parted company with his long-term agents earlier this summer, and it's understood his new representation have been assessing potential landing spots for Paqueta during the current transfer window.  Paris Saint-Germain showed interest in Paqueta earlier this summer and retain an interest in his services, while the recently appointed director of the Saudi Pro League, Michael Emenalo, is keeping apprised of the midfielder's situation at West Ham. 90min has also learned of significant interest from Premier League champions Manchester City, who have made a verbal offer of  £70m for Paqueta. West Ham have turned that bid down and have insisted that they do not intend to sell Paqueta, however sources have told 90min that an offer 'too good to turn down' would be considered. feed Whether or not City return for Paqueta remains to be seen, but they certainly have the financial capability to offer West Ham an increased figure - the money at their disposal evidenced by their  £90m bid for Declan Rice earlier this summer. It's also rare for City to engage in talks unless they have a genuine belief of signing a player. City's interest stems from their desire to replace Ilkay Gundogan and Riyad Mahrez, who have left for Barcelona and Al Ahli respectively, but isn't believed to be connected to a potential sale of Bernardo Silva. 90min recently revealed that Barcelona have made fresh contact with Silva in an attempt to prise the Portuguese international away from City, but they have no intention to sell at this point. Paris Saint-Germain are also interested in the 28-year-old. 90min further understands that Newcastle's long-term interest in Paqueta has not waned, but a deal may be difficult for them to do because of Financial Fair Play regulations. A loan with obligation to buy  appears to be the only way the Magpies could facilitate a move this summer, though that is unlikely to happen at this stage.\",\n",

Nevertheless, 90min understands Arsenal are not planning on parting ways with Jorginho this summer, although the Italian is among a group of players for whom sizeable offers would be entertained. Speaking to Tuttomercatoweb, agent Joao Santos confirmed that Jorginho expects to end the summer with Arsenal. \"Jorginho is focused, he is thinking about Saturday and playing his sixth year in the Premier League as well as his fifth in the Champions League,\" he said. \"And above all, he is focused on the national team.\" feed Santos went on to confess he had received interest from clubs across the globe but reiterated the plan to keep Jorginho at Arsenal. \"He will stay at Arsenal,\" the agent said. \"He is happy to be in England. \"Some enquiries, for example from Saudi Arabia. Someone called me, but nothing concrete. Jorginho is also appreciated in Spain, he\\'s an important player. But he will stay at Arsenal.\" Declan Rice\\'s summer switch to Arsenal has increased the competition for minutes at the base of the Gunners\\' midfield, where Thomas Partey also remains after a potential move to Saudi Arabia ultimately failed to materialise.

       "  'text': 'Carlo Ancelotti has insisted Real Madrid have total faith in Ukraine international Andriy Lunin as they consider their goalkeeping options in the wake of Thibaut Courtois\\' injury. Courtois is set to undergo surgery after tearing his ACL in training and is subsequently expected to miss the vast majority of the upcoming campaign, leaving Madrid with Lunin as their only senior goalkeeper. As 90min reported following Courtois\\' injury, Madrid have not yet ruled out keeping Lunin as their starting goalkeeper, although club officials are drawing up a list of potential targets as they seek to bolster in the position once again. After contact was made with free agent David de Gea, Madrid focused their efforts on Sevilla stopper Yassine Bounou, who is keen to make the move this summer. However, with Lunin set to start the campaign in goal as Madrid open their season against Athletic Club on Saturday, Ancelotti reiterated his faith in the 24-year-old. feed \"Emotionally, it was not a good day,\" Ancelotti told a press conference. \"We are sad on a personal level as it is an injury to an important player, but these things happen in football. \"We wish [Courtois] a speedy recovery and we give all the confidence in the world to Lunin, who is a great goalkeeper. In pre-season, he did well. Total confidence in him, we think he is a talent. What he lacks is what everyone lacks, experience, but he will take it game by game.\" Asked whether he would like a new signing, Ancelotti responded: \"We have time until 31 August. Behind Lunin, our goalkeepers have potential, but they are young. We will think about it. Fran [Gonzalez] is 17 years old. \"If we sign a new goalkeeper, we will do it for numbers because we have confidence in Lunin. The confidence in Lunin is total.\" Ancelotti ended with a simple assessment of the sort of goalkeeper he would like to see Madrid bring in.    One that stops the ball with his hands,\" the Italian quipped. \"First and foremost, one that makes saves. That is what I ask of all goalkeepers. Let them be good with their hands. When it comes to feet, it\\'s better to have a striker.\"',\n",

       "  'text': \"Harry Kane has not yet accepted Bayern Munich's offer of a summer transfer, 90min understands, with Tottenham Hotspur hopeful their talisman will instead agree to stay. Having seen Kane enter the final year of his contract, Spurs have begrudgingly accepted a bid from Bayern worth    100m ( £86.4m) but have long been determined to convince the England international to reject their advances and stay. While Bayern were confident an agreement with Spurs was all that was missing in their pursuit of Kane, sources have confirmed to 90min that the 30-year-old has not yet given his approval to a move to Munich. Kane is understood to be considering his options, one of which is to remain with Spurs beyond this summer, and sources close to the club are now hopeful that Kane will agree to remain at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium for at least one more season. The striker informed both Spurs and Bayern earlier this week that he wanted his future resolved by the time the new Premier League season kicks off this weekend, with Spurs due to play Brentford on Sunday. feed Bayern themselves wanted a deal wrapped up when they lodged a third bid which was also worth    100m, but based around a less-favourable payment structure for the Premier League side. But they did not get the immediate response they were hoping for as Spurs chairman Daniel Levy delayed his eventual rejection. They have now seen a bid accepted which would satisfy Kane's deadline but the striker has not yet given the green light - a hesitance which has left Spurs optimistic about their chances of keeping the striker. Should Kane stay, he would be able to discuss a free transfer overseas in January, with Spurs at risk of losing him for free next summer, when Premier League rivals would also be able to offer a contract. Spurs have long been determined to keep Kane and have never given up on convincing the England captain to sign a new contract further down the line.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"West Ham United have contacted Montpellier over striker Elye Wahi and are weighing up an offer, 90min understands. The Hammers confirmed their first major signing of the summer on Thursday, committing Edson Alvarez to a five-year contract after agreeing to pay Ajax up to  £34m for his services.  £30m deals are also in place for Southampton captain James Ward-Prowse and Manchester United defender Harry Maguire, while West Ham also have eyes on signing a new striker, wide forward and left back before the window closes on September 1     the club have money to spend after selling Declan Rice to Arsenal for a British-record fee of  £105m. 90min previously revealed that West Ham had shown an interest in 20-year-old Wahi, who bagged 19 goals for Montpellier in Ligue 1, amid concerns that Saudi Pro League side Al Ettifaq, managed by Steven Gerrard, may try to prise Michail Antonio away from London Stadium. That move hasn't come to fruition but Gianluca Scamacca has departed West Ham, joining Atalanta on a permanent basis. His exit has left the club a little light up front, with Antonio, Danny Ings and academy striker Divin Mubama the options at David Moyes' disposal. Sources have now confirmed to 90min that West Ham have made contact with Montpellier over Wahi - a player admired by technical director Tim Steidten - with a view to making an offer for the France Under-21 international. feed But getting a deal over the line won't be easy. Wahi has generated considerable interest this summer, with Arsenal and Chelsea among his Premier League suitors - the latter have been made a verbal offer. Ligue 1 giants Monaco are also considering a bid, though crucially they can't offer European football this season like West Ham can, and Eintracht Frankfurt think Wahi could be the ideal fit to replace Randal Kolo Muani. Kolo Muani has been strongly linked with Paris Saint-Germain and Bayern Munich this summer, as well as Manchester United, and 90min understands that West Ham have enquired about his potential price tag too - PSG are leading the charge though as they cast Kylian Mbappe to one side in a furious dispute over his future, and it looks increasingly likely that Kolo Muani will return to Ligue 1 if a fee can be agreed. Montpellier are expected to demand a fee of at least  £35m for Wahi, though they still may look to keep him after renewing his contract just six months ago. West Ham's other major piece of business surrounds the interest from Premier League champions Manchester City in Lucas Paqueta. A verbal  £70m offer was swiftly rejected by the Hammers, who don't want to sell the Brazilian, but it's expected that the treble winners will imminently return with an improved bid.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Real Madrid are now in the market for a new goalkeeper after Thibaut Courtois suffered a potential season-ending injury this week.  The Belgian shot-stopper suffered an ACL injury which will unfortunately require surgery and an extremely lengthy spell on the sidelines.  In the imemdiate term Andriy Lunin will stand in. But here's the options available to Madrid in what remains of this summer transfer window in order to replace the stricken Courtois... feed Diogo Costa is the best goalkeeper on this list. That is a fact. The Porto star is an archtypal modern goalie who is as equally with the ball at his feet as he is in between the sticks. So why is he the last on these options, you ask? Well the fact that he has a  £65m (   75m) release clause in his contract - something which we highly doubt Real Madrid would pay. Likelihood: 1/10 The 22-year-old has been consistently linked with a move away from Valencia in recent months, so it only makes sense to add him to list of potential Courtois deputies. The  £25m asking price that Valencia have put on the goalkeeper makes any move unlikely however, especially when there's much, much cheaper options who would do as good a job currently on the market. Likelihood: 2/10  Recently linked with a move to Bayern, regular Premier League viewers are well aware of Kepa Arrizabalaga's deficiencies. He's not all bad though, and if Chelsea are desperate to get ride of him this summer then he could be available for an okay price.Kepa was actually heavily linked with Madrid once before, way back in 2018.Likelihood: 4/10  Even before the news broke that Thibaut Courtois was set to miss the majority of the season, David Soria was being linked with a move to the Santiago Bernabeu. A deal was reported to have fallen through in July due to a mixture of Getafe wanting  £8m for his services and Soria not being keen on becoming a second choice goalkeeper. With the opportunity to become Madrid's first-choice shot-stopper for a season now available, Soria may be more keen to join the club. Likelihood: 6/10  Three UEFA Champions Leagues, one La Liga and four FIFA Club World Cups. It's fair to say that Keylor Navas enjoyed his previous stint at Real Madrid. His success at the club in the mid-2010s, coupled with his availability due to lowly position in the PSG goalkeeper ranks means this deal would make a lot of sense. Likelihood: 8/10  Once upon a time, David de Gea was a fax machine away from joining Real Madrid for around  £30m.Now, Madrid can sign the goalkeeper as a free agent and not have worry about paying a fee or rely on a fax machine to work properly. He's the logical choice. Likelihood: 10/10\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Harry Kane is set to leave Tottenham Hotspur this summer after agreeing to join German champions Bayern Munich, 90min understands. Bayern lodged four bids for the England striker, eventually agreeing to a    100m ( £86.4m) deal to lure Kane away, but the striker himself did not immediately give his approval to a move as he considered all his options. While the initial delay left Spurs feeling hopeful they may have convinced their captain to stay, 90min understands that Kane has now accepted Bayern's proposal and is set to leave the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium this summer. Kane, who set a deadline of Sunday to resolve his future, is due in Germany on Friday to undergo a medical ahead of signing a four-year contract with the Bundesliga champions. However, Spurs have currently delayed signing off on the deal and are keen to finalise each and every minor detail before allowing Kane to depart. Bayern are hopeful that Kane will be in attendance for Saturday's Super Cup clash with RB Leipzig, perhaps even playing a role in the match if all goes to plan. feed The move to Germany, if sealed as expected, will bring an end to Kane's 19-year association with Tottenham, in which he has racked up 280 goals in 435 appearances. Kane's pursuit of Alan Shearer's all-time Premier League top scorer record will also be halted, perhaps permanently. The 30-year-old has struck 213 times in the competition, 47 fewer than Blackburn and Newcastle icon Shearer. While they had been hopeful of keeping Kane, Spurs have been exploring potential replacements for the England captain in anticipation of a departure. Argentina youth international Alejo Veliz has agreed to join but Spurs are also looking at the likes of Gent's Gift Orban, Montpellier's Elye Wahi and Lille's Jonathan David. Aleksandar Mitrovic of Fulham is also on Spurs' radar. The Serb was keen to leave for Saudi Arabia earlier this summer but has seen a move blocked by Fulham, who are demanding  £50m to part ways with their star striker.\",\n",

Alvarez has emerged as one of West Ham's top targets this summer, and is the choice of recently appointed technical director Tim Steidten. Steidten and manager David Moyes have been struggling to agree on targets throughout the summer. That has now seen West Ham switch focus to Alvarez after failing to seal deals for Southampton's James Ward-Prowse and Manchester United's Scott McTominay. West Ham, despite the record sale of Declan Rice, have yet to make a breakthrough in the transfer market and that plight was highlighted at the weekend as they were hammered 4-0 by Bayer Leverkusen - ironically Steidten's former club. He has now pushed ahead with a move for Alvarez in an attempt to get something done before the start of the Premier League season next weekend. feed Now, West Ham have made an initial offer  £25.9m for Alvarez. Although that isn't considered enough by Ajax, who are seeking just over  £30m, talks have continued and are at an advanced stage. Alvarez was a target for Chelsea last year and almost joined Borussia Dortmund earlier this summer, before that deal fell through to give West Ham the opportunity to try and land him. 90min understands the Hammers are looking to bring in up to six players before the summer window closes and getting the Alvarez deal over the line is seen as a key breakthrough in the transfer market.\",\n",

West Ham saw an opening offer for former captain Maguire worth  £20m rebuffed last month before a more recent second proposal of  £30m was also dismissed by United. The Hammers also firmed up their interest in another United star in the shape of Scottish midfielder McTominay but, like with Maguire, the Red Devils were not willing to do business at the  £30m mark. 90min understands the actual offers were not too far away from United's valuation, but the overall deals including the wages West Ham could afford or were willing to provide were not sufficient enough to tempt the Old Trafford giants into selling either player. United, who themselves have spent more than  £100m this summer on Andre Onana, Mason Mount and Rasmus Hojlund, are anxious to move players on to finance other deals and Erik ten Hag has sanctioned the departures of both Maguire and McTominay.  However, neither player is desperate to move. feed Maguire remains unconvinced that his future is best served away from the club despite having the captaincy stripped, while McTominay also believes he could yet play his way into Ten Hag's plans given fellow midfielders Donny van de Beek and Fred are expected to move this summer.  West Ham - who are the only team to make firm offers for either Maguire or McTominay this summer - are now considering improved bids for the two players. They are also looking to complete the signing of Ajax midfielder Edson Alvarez in the coming days.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'As the coronavirus pandemic forced the world to pause, Alejo Veliz seriously considered pressing stop on his dreams of becoming a professional footballer. The 16-year-old had just begun pre-season with Central Rosario\\'s youth team when COVID-19 hit. \"I couldn\\'t go back and I started to think about studying something because it took too long,\" Veliz remembered. \"Thank God I stayed.\" Veliz made his debut for the senior side 18 months after the pandemic\\'s outbreak and has been a fixture of the first team since 2022. This summer, the teenager has attracted increasing interest from the Premier League\\'s Tottenham Hotspur. Aside from an iron will, here\\'s why Spurs are leading the race for a player who almost gave up the game entirely three years ago.    ¥          Alejo V  liz, 1 a 0 y explota el Gigante pic.twitter.com/mIBkaAWChy Veliz made his debut for Central in July 2021. Within 12 months, he had entered club folklore. Half-time was rapidly approaching in the fiercely contested Rosarian derby against Newell\\'s Old Boys when Jhonatan Candia swung a free kick into the box. Veliz, who stands at 6\\'1, out-jumped his marker to loop Central into a lead. The only goal of the game sparked an ear-splitting roar in the Gigante de Arroyito. Veliz has many years of football ahead of him but will have to go some way to top a decisive contribution against your first club\\'s biggest rivals. The winner against Newell\\'s was only the third goal of Veliz\\'s senior career but it would prove to be a prescient participation. Six of Veliz\\'s 19 goals for Central exploded off his forehead and all three of his strikes during this year\\'s under-20 World Cup were headers. Harry Kane broke the Premier League record for headed goals in a single season last term, notching ten. Tottenham\\'s talisman took advantage of the team\\'s myriad of set-piece ploys sketched up by the specialist coach Gianni Vio. The Italian may have parted ways with the club this summer but new manager Ange Postecoglou developed a range of routines during his time at Celtic. While Veliz would offer another aerial target other than Kane it would be an almighty task for the youngster to replace the England captain entirely if a move to Bayern Munich does materialise. Veliz may be one of the Argentine top flight\\'s most exciting young strikers but he is best described as promising rather than prolific and still has plenty of rough edges to smooth - notably, his ability (or willingness) to create for others. If the teenager does move to Tottenham, it will surely be in an understudy role to the first choice option - whether that be Kane or the misfiring Richarlison. What Veliz does bring in abundance is grit. During Carlos Tevez\\'s brief five months as Central coach, Veliz said that he \"took every piece of advice he gave me\". That tenacity embodied by the former Manchester United and Manchester City striker is evident in Veliz on and off the pitch. In April of this year, the day after scoring in a 2-2 draw against Boca Juniors, Veliz was driving to training when he was T-boned by a truck which fled the scene. He started Central\\'s next match the following week. Just four days after playing in Argentina\\'s last-16 exit from this summer\\'s under-20 World Cup, Veliz not only appeared for Central but scored in a 4-1 win over Instituto. Team Appearances Goals Assists Rosario Central 62 19 2 Argentina Under-20s 9 3 0 feed An impressive tally of 11 goals in 23 top-flight games for Central this year - the highest tally of any teenager in the division - has attracted interest from across Europe. The bulk of bids swamping Rosario Central\\'s transfer department stemmed from Serie A. AC Milan, Roma, Salernitana and Torino all expressed interest in the 19-year-old, who set tongues wagging at a greater velocity with his forceful displays in this year\\'s under-20 World Cup. Tottenham\\'s Premier League rivals Nottingham Forest also flirted with Veliz but 90min understands that the striker is prioritising a move to north London after Spurs agreed to meet his  £13m release clause. However, when Veliz will line up for the Lilywhites remains to be seen. Spurs are expected to hand Veliz a long-term deal but may be prepared to loan the striker back to Central in the immediate future. The Rosario club are certainly trying to keep hold of their talented forward - who would join the likes of Angel Di Maria and his potential Tottenham teammate Giovani Lo Celso in big-money moves away from Central. Talk of a loan until January, if not longer, has been floated. Just three short years ago, Veliz didn\\'t look like making a professional appearance for any club, let alone one in the world\\'s biggest league.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Harry Kane has informed Tottenham that he will not look to leave the club once the new Premier League season gets underway, 90min understands. Kane has entered the final year of his Spurs contract and has been pursued heavily by Bayern Munich, who have seen three bids knocked back for the England striker, the last of which was a club-record offer worth    100m ( £86m). Bayern had stressed that their third offer would be their last but are understood to be considering a fourth approach for Kane. While the German giants explore their options, sources have confirmed to 90min that Kane has made it clear he will not consider a move away from Spurs once the new season gets underway this weekend. Spurs are due to travel across London to face Brentford on 13 August and, if he is still at the club on that date, then Kane plans to remain for at least the whole campaign. feed That message has been conveyed to Bayern, who now have less than week to make a decision over a fourth bid. Spurs chairman Daniel Levy has not yet given a firm asking price and remains determined to not only keep Kane at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, but also to convince the 30-year-old to put pen to paper on a new contract. Bayern's hierarchy are understood to be divided on their next move. While some are encouraging an improved bid, others believe they are fighting a losing battle and are keen to start looking elsewhere. Scouts have drawn up reports on alternative targets, with the likes of Juventus' Dusan Vlahovic and Eintracht Frankfurt's Randal Kolo Muani on Bayern's radar.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Tottenham Hotspur are in talks with Galatasaray over the potential sale of two first-team players, sources have conformed to 90min. Spurs are looking to trim down their squad for new head coach Ange Postecoglou and ahead of a season in which they will not be competing in European football for the first time since 2009/10. 90min reported last month that Davinson Sanchez had been granted permission to discuss a move away, with Strasbourg and Spartak Moscow interested in his services. Talks are ongoing with the Russian club over a move, but they now face competition from Turkish side Galatasaray, who recently bolstered their ranks with the high-profile addition of Wilfried Zaha. Sanchez has other suitors from the Premier League too, with Fulham, Nottingham Forest and Wolves all making enquiries to Spurs. Galatasaray have also been offered the chance to bring in Tottenham's club-record signing Tanguy Ndombele. The France midfielder spent last season on loan at Napoli, helping them win Serie A, and he is now seen as a possible alternative to Manchester United's Fred by Galatasaray. Ndombele was set to feature on Spurs' pre-season tour of Australia and Asia, but sustained an injury prior to their first friendly and has only just returned to training. feed Lazio are on the verge of signing free agent Daichi Kamada after AC Milan backed out of a deal last month. The Rossoneri had been expected to sign the Japan midfielder from Eintracht Frankfurt but pulled the plug following a shake-up among their transfer decision-makers. Tottenham and West Ham held talks with Kamada's representatives about a move but both ultimately stopped short of offering him a contract, and he will now put pen to paper on a contract with Lazio. A superb summer for Bournemouth is set to continue with the signing of Fiorentina midfielder Gaetano Castrovilli for a fee that could reach  £13.7m. The Cherries have ousted competition from Serie A giants Inter and Lazio for his signature, while Napoli had also made enquiries earlier this window. Castrovilli will arrive in England to undergo a medical on Friday and seal his move to the Vitality Stadium. While Fiorentina will lose Castrovilli, they will add Yerry Mina to their squad following his release from Everton. The Colombia international has completed his medical and will serve as a replacement for Igor, who recently signed for Brighton & Hove Albion. Fulham had held talks with Mina regarding a move but he is heading to Italy instead.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Liverpool legend and Al Ettifaq manager Steven Gerrard has admitted he does not want to see Mohamed Salah follow him to Saudi Arabia. The Reds have already lost two key players to Saudi Arabia this summer, with Fabinho joining Al Ittihad and captain Jordan Henderson linking back up with Gerrard at Al Ettifaq, and Saudi officials are understood to be keen to sign Salah. Fortunately for Liverpool fans, Salah\\'s agent has already publicly shot down the rumours, insisting the Egyptian does not want to leave Anfield this summer. That stance will have gone down well with Gerrard, who recently confessed that he would rather see Salah fire Liverpool to more success before making a move to the Middle East. feed Asked by Sada Al Mala   eb if he would want to sign Salah, Gerrard responded: \"No! No, no - the answer is no, because Mohamed Salah is my favourite player, I love Liverpool Football Club, so Mohamed can stay where he is. \"When he wins more leagues and more Champions Leagues with Liverpool, we\\'ll maybe consider it.\" Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp recently urged FIFA to look at reducing the length of the Saudi transfer window, which runs until 20 September - 19 days after the European window slams shut. \"The influence of Saudi Arabia is massive at the moment,\" Klopp said. \"Pretty much the worst thing is that the transfer window in Saudi Arabia is open three weeks longer. If I am right, I heard something like that, then at least in Europe that   s not helpful. \"UEFA or FIFA must find solutions for that. It   s already influential for us but we will have to learn to deal with it.\"',\n",

       "  'text': \"Arsenal have agreed a fee with Brentford for the transfer of goalkeeper David Raya, sources have confirmed to 90min. The Spain international has been looking to leave the Bees this summer after turning down various offers of a new contract. His current deal expires in 2024. Brentford have been willing to facilitate a sale but their initial  £40m asking price put off various suitors. Tottenham Hotspur agreed personal terms with Raya but backed away from a deal due to this valuation, while Bayern Munich also dropped their interest for similar reasons. 90min understands Arsenal's opening offer of  £20m plus a further  £5m in add-ons was knocked back by the Bees, but they have now succeeded with a new bid which is believed to be worth  £30m in total. Raya has been determined to secure a move to the Emirates Stadium and he is expected to undergo a medical shortly. feed The Gunners have long-admired Raya and tried to sign him back in 2020, but were unable to get a deal over the line. Arsenal goalkeeper coach Inaki Cana worked with the Spaniard during his brief spell at Brentford. Raya will provide competition for England international Aaron Ramsdale though is not expected to be the immediate first-choice goalkeeper at Arsenal. Since Brentford were promoted from the Championship in 2021, Raya has proven to be one of the Premier League's leading goalkeepers due to his shot-stopping and ability to play from the back. Brentford will head into the new season with Netherlands international Mark Flekken as their starting goalkeeper following his summer arrival from Freiburg\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Paris Saint-Germain are continuing to explore ways of parting with Neymar this summer, sources have confirmed to 90min. Neymar has been unsettled for months in the French capital but his team of representatives, led by his father, insist that they are not leading the push for an exit. The 31-year-old\\'s father, Neymar Da Silva Santos, was quick to deny reports from French daily L\\'Equipe which stated that the Brazilian had told PSG that he wants to leave the club. \"I can\\'t confirm a news that didn\\'t happen. L\\'Equipe being L\\'Efake, this came from somewhere, let\\'s try to understand the intention,\" the senior Neymar told PL Brasil. Sources have told 90min that while Neymar is unsettled, it is PSG who are working hard to try and move him on. A return to Barcelona has been mooted but, although president Joan Laporta is believed to be keen, manager Xavi is not believed to be looking at Neymar as a realistic target - instead preferring they focus on Manchester City\\'s Bernardo Silva. Chelsea have also been linked, with club owner Todd Boehly a confirmed fan, but the Blues have not yet indicated any desire to make a move for Neymar this summer despite being contacted by those working on the deal. Contact has also been made with representatives of the Saudi Pro League and the Public Investment Fund (PIF), who also own Newcastle. PIF would love to lure Neymar to St James\\' Park but would also consider recruiting the 31-year-old for one of their Saudi outfits: Al Ittihad, Al Nassr, Al Ahli or Al Hilal. feed PSG are currently locked in talks with PIF over the potential sale of midfielder Marco Verratti, but they are struggling to agree a fee as they demand nearly double the initial    30m ( £26m) offer that has come in. It was during these conversations that Neymar\\'s name was first mentioned. 90min understands that Verratti remains unhappy with the treatment of both Neymar and Kylian Mbappe, who has been put up for sale and banished from first-team training after refusing to extend his contract. Verratti has made those concerns known to the club\\'s hierarchy. New manager Luis Enrique is keen to keep the Italian but is believed to be open to parting ways with Neymar this summer. PSG are already working hard on new signings for Enrique and have bolstered in attack with the signing of Goncalo Ramos, who has joined on an initial loan from Benfica which comes with an option for a permanent    80m ( £69m) move to the French capital next summer. Eintracht Frankfurt\\'s Randal Kolo Muani is also a key target and personal terms have been agreed with the 24-year-old.',\n",

A  £38m deal was agreed with Monaco earlier this week to bring Disasi, who was playing alongside current Blues defender Benoit Badiashile last season, over to Stamford Bridge. The deal is now complete, with 25-year-old Disasi signing a six-year contract to commit himself to Chelsea until 2029. \"Axel has showcased his quality over several seasons in France and that has deservedly led to recognition on the international stage,\" said sporting directors Paul Winstanley and Laurence Stewart, the latter of whom joined from Monaco in February. \"He is ready to take the next step in his career and we are delighted that will be with Chelsea. We welcome him to the club and look forward to him joining up with Mauricio Pochettino and his new teammates in the days ahead.\" feed Disasi becomes Chelsea\\'s sixth signing of the summer, following Christopher Nkunku, Nicolas Jackson, Lesley Ugochukwu, Angelo and Diego Moreira in putting pen to paper on contracts at Stamford Bridge. A move for Disasi was accelerated after it was revealed that fellow defender Wesley Fofana had undergone surgery on an ACL injury which will keep him out for the majority of the coming campaign. Chelsea are well-stocked at centre-back, where Disasi\\'s former Monaco teammate Badiashile joins Thiago Silva, Levi Colwill and Trevoh Chalobah as available options for the coming campaign. Pochettino enjoyed an unbeaten pre-season and will return to Premier League action when Liverpool make the trip to London on 13 August.',\n",

After searching for a new goalkeeper to compete with Kepa Arrizabalaga, the Blues settled on Sanchez and quickly agreed a fee for the 25-year-old which 90min understands sits around the  £20m mark. Having passed his medical, Sanchez has put pen to paper on a seven-year contract to become Chelsea\\'s seventh signing of the summer. \"We   re very pleased to welcome Robert to Chelsea and he adds further quality to our goalkeeping unit,\" said sporting directors Laurence Stewart and Paul Winstanley, the latter of whom also joined from Brighton last summer. \"Robert has repeatedly proved himself in the Premier League and been capped by his country.

Chelsea\\'s current lead goalkeeping coach is Toni Jimenez, who joined as part of Mauricio Pochettino\\'s backroom staff. Sanchez leaves Brighton with 87 Premier League appearances to his name and it is that experience in England which has helped endear him to Chelsea\\'s recruitment team, who wanted an experience name to compete with Arrizabalaga. Thanks to his time in the Brighton academy, Sanchez also counts as a homegrown player in the Premier League, which comes as a boost to a Chelsea squad which has already bid farewell to Mason Mount and Ruben Loftus-Cheek this summer.',\n",

       "  'text': 'The agent of Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah has confirmed the Egyptian has no plans to listen to interest from Saudi Arabia. Rumours emerged over the weekend suggesting Salah was being lined up as the next superstar target of the Saudi Pro League, with champions Al Ittihad reported to have offered the 31-year-old a contract worth a cool  £155m. A  £52m transfer fee was also slated to be offered to Liverpool, who sold midfielder Fabinho to the same Saudi side earlier this window. In response, Salah\\'s agent has publicly confirmed there are no plans to leave Liverpool this summer. \"If we considered leaving LFC this year, we wouldn   t have renewed the contract last summer,\" Ramy Abbas Issa wrote on Twitter. \"Mohamed remains committed to LFC.\" If we considered leaving LFC this year, we wouldn   t have renewed the contract last summer. Mohamed remains committed to LFC. 90min understands there has been and remains interest from the Saudi Pro League in Salah. There have been enquiries, although the Liverpool star has primarily always been considered a target for 2024 or beyond, rather than necessarily this year. It means the matter isn\\'t likely to be closed. feed Salah, whose Liverpool contract still has two years left to run, has played plenty of minutes in pre-season, currently sits sixth on the Reds\\' all-time scoring charts and was recently tipped to climb even higher in the standings by current record holder Ian Rush. \"I speak a lot to Mo Salah,\" Rush told Prothom Alo. \"Mo keeps saying, \\'why did you score so many goals?\\'. He is thinking he might break my record. \"He would have to be there a good few more years if he is going to break that record. He plays a bit more of a wide role now. I don\\'t think he has scored as many goals but I think he made just as many assists this year. \"He has become more of a team player. A couple of years ago, he was maybe being a little selfish. But in the last two years, he has become more of a team player. And I think he is making just as many assists as he is scoring goals. \"Good luck to him. If he does it, he does it. I don\\'t care as long as he is winning things. There is no point doing that if you are not winning trophies. He can have that as long as they win a trophy.\"',\n",

       "  'text': \"The Premier League has firmly cemented itself as the financial powerhouse of both European and world football - at least until the Saudi Pro League started throwing ridiculous wages around. The spending power of the biggest clubs in England's top flight is almost unrivalled in Europe with even mid-to-lower table sides now on a par with many top teams in Italy, Germany and Spain. For that reason, the general trend of spending figures in Premier League transfer windows is only going up, even if it's not quite as simple as the final figure being higher year on year. Here are the six highest-spending Premier League transfer windows ever. That such a recent year is down in sixth place is due to the real effects of the Covid-19 pandemic that began to be felt by football clubs. Less so at Premier League level, of course, but it still existed.Major moves in this summer transfer window included Romelu Lukaku's return to Chelsea from Inter for  £103.5m, Jack Grealish's switch from Aston Villa to Manchester City for  £100m and Jadon Sancho's  £76.5m arrival at Manchester United from Borussia Dortmund. A big summer for a number of teams, Liverpool spent big to bring in Alisson for  £66.8m and Naby Keita for  £48m, as well as Fabinho for  £39m. Man City splashed out on Riyad Mahrez for  £60m from Leicester, while Chelsea paid  £71.6m for Kepa Arrizabalaga.Fred arrived at Man Utd for  £47m and there were also plenty of mid-level deals done by some of the smaller sides in the league, such as Richarlison's  £25m move to Everton. You may expect this transfer window to have been more depressed due to the Covid-19 pandemic but there was little knowledge at this stage about just how disrupted life was going to be over the next couple of years.For that reason, Premier League spending was around the sort of level that had become the norm in the few years prior. Chelsea spent  £222.5m in this window on players like Kai Havertz, Timo Werner and Ben Chilwell. Man City signed Ruben Dias for  £61m, while Liverpool forked out  £40m on Diogo Jota. This was a record-breaking year at the time and really made a lot of people sit up and realise just how much the Premier League was now able to spend.Mohamed Salah arrived at Liverpool, though only for a modest fee of  £34m, while Man Utd spent  £146m on Romelu Lukaku, Nemanja Matic and Victor Lindelof. Man City parted with  £211m on various players that included Ederson, Danilo, Kyle Walker and Bernardo Silva.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Pep Guardiola got in on a joke that has dogged Josko Gvardiol for years. \"What a beautiful surname he has,\" Manchester City\\'s manager grinned before confirming that the Croatian centre-back was undergoing a medical for the European and Premier League champions. Rather than an homage to the Catalan coach, Gvardiol\\'s last name is actually derived from the Latin verb \\'guardare\\', which fittingly translates as \\'to guard\\'. Gvardiol may only be 21 years of age but he has emerged as one of the most highly rated defenders in the world - a lofty billing that is reflected by the hefty fee City belatedly agreed with RB Leipzig this summer. Here\\'s how Gvardiol\\'s transfer to Manchester City compares to the most expensive players to ever guard their own team\\'s goal. Suits you, Josko!          pic.twitter.com/ySy5CfUAQ9 Manchester City\\'s Premier League rivals Chelsea were initially the front runners, failing with an approach for Gvardiol last summer before reigniting their interest in January. Real Madrid entered the race for the Golden Boy nominee, placing Gvardiol top of their centre-back targets in April as reported by 90min. However, Los Blancos have prioritised other areas of the pitch, notably midfield, while Chelsea opted to promote from within by handing the left-footed centre-back Levi Colwill a new six-year deal this summer. City\\'s intent has not shifted even if their patience has been tested. The reigning Premier League champions are no strangers to walking away from a deal which does not match their valuation - as they have previously demonstrated with Harry Maguire, Marc Cucurella and even Declan Rice this summer. At one point in July, RB Leipzig sporting director Max Eberl threatened to step back from negotiations as the clubs remained \"very far apart\". Talks between both parties were gummed up by the proposed fee. RB Leipzig were intent on making Gvardiol the most expensive defender in history, eclipsing the  £80m which Manchester United spent on Maguire in 2019. Finally, after months of painstaking negotiations, City appear to have won the battle of wills. Three days before Gvardiol was officially unveiled, 90min revealed that Leipzig had settled for an initial fee of  £77.5m (   90m). The final sum for Gvardiol may have just been shy of Maguire\\'s record, but where does he rank on the list of the game\\'s most expensive defenders ever? feed Player Year signed Selling club Buying club Fee Harry Maguire 2019 Leicester Man Utd  £80m Josko Gvardiol 2023 RB Leipzig Man City  £77.5m Virgil van Dijk 2018 Southampton Liverpool  £75m Wesley Fofana 2022 Leicester Chelsea  £75m Lucas Hernandez 2019 Atletico Madrid Bayern Munich  £68m Matthijs de Ligt 2019 Ajax Juventus  £68m Ruben Dias 2020 Benfica Man City  £62m Achraf Hakimi 2021 Inter PSG  £59m Matthijs de Ligt 2022 Juventus Bayern Munich  £59m Marc Cucurella 2022 Brighton Chelsea  £55m Gvardiol slots into second place on the all-time list of costly defenders, sandwiched between the hulking figures of Maguire and Virgil van Dijk. Liverpool briefly made Van Dijk the most expensive centre-back ever in January 2018, coughing up  £75m to Southampton. During the previous summer, Van Dijk was accused of going on strike to force through a move by his last Southampton manager Mauricio Pellegrino. The Saints stuck to their guns and kept the unhappy defender on their books for another six months, driving up the price from an initial  £60m. Unsurprisingly, given the financial clout that the Premier League wields, the four most expensive defenders of all time have been signed by English clubs. Wesley Fofana moved to Chelsea in the summer of 2022 for the same fee as Van Dijk but has come nowhere near the performances produced by the 2019 UEFA Men\\'s Player of the Year. Injury has routinely derailed Fofana\\'s integration in west London. After sitting out 20 games during his debut campaign, the luckless Frenchman ruptured his cruciate ligament in July.  Matthijs de Ligt has been repeatedly linked with a move to the Premier League but is yet to permanently journey across the Channel. The towering Dutch centre-back is the only defender that has ever commanded two separate transfer fees in excess of  £50m. At just 21, Gvardiol has plenty of time to make another expensive move but he has to guard the goal for Guardiola\\'s team first.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Tottenham have turned down Bayern Munich   s club record transfer bid for Harry Kane, sources have confirmed to 90min. Bayern have been keen on landing Kane ever since Robert Lewandowski joined Barcelona last summer. They had already seen two offers rejected by Tottenham earlier this summer, but left a recent meeting between club representatives feeling optimistic about a deal being struck, before then entering their third bid worth    100m ( £86m). That figure was both a record for Bayern, far exceeding what they paid for Lucas Hernandez in 2019, as well as Tottenham, who sold Gareth Bale to Real Madrid for  £85m in 2013. Despite Bayern wanting a quick decision from Spurs, the Premier League side took their time in relaying a response. 90min understands that the answer has been given and it remains    no   . Bayern had made it clear that it was their best and final offer, but are currently considering whether or not to return with a fourth proposal for the England captain. feed Although optimistic at the start of August, Bayern have also started to weigh up other options once more. One alternative is Juventus striker Dusan Vlahovic, who has already asked for a transfer this summer following a sub-par season in Serie A. Bayern have been in touch with his representatives, although Juventus have also been in touch with Chelsea regarding a Romelu Lukaku plus cash swap. Another striker Bayern have long kept an eye on is Randal Kolo Muani at Eintracht Frankfurt, the    100m ( £86m) asking price, despite matching the offer for Kane, is not something they want to pay. Rather, Paris Saint-Germain have emerged as favourites for France international Kolo Muani. Personal terms have already been agreed following talks over the weekend, with the club expected to follow suit and agree a transfer fee between them. PSG are also willing to offer Hugo Ekitike, whose loan from Reims was made permanent in June, in part-exchange.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Barcelona midfielder Franck Kessie is closing in on a move to Saudi Pro League side Al Ahli, sources have confirmed to 90min. The Ivory Coast international only joined Barca from AC Milan on a free transfer last summer, and despite scoring a memorable last-minute winner against Real Madrid on their way to La Liga title glory, he was scarcely afforded extended chances at Camp Nou. 90min reported on Wednesday that Tottenham Hotspur had held talks with Barcelona over signing Kessie as well as teammate Clement Lenglet, who spent last season on loan in north London. But 90min understands that Spurs are again set to miss out on a long-term target in Kessie as he has agreed to join Saudi outfit Al Ahli. Barcelona had initially assumed that Kessie's preference was to remain in Europe, but they will now sit down to thrash out a    15m ( £13m) with Al Ahli, who have also signed Edouard Mendy, Roberto Firmino, Riyad Mahrez and Allan Saint-Maximin this transfer window. feed Crucially, Barcelona will not have to pay a portion of Kessie's wages in order to get him off their books, allowing them further flexibility under La Liga's strict financial restrictions. In addition to Tottenham, Juventus had also been eyeing Kessie and had made a tentative loan offer to Barcelona. The Bianconeri have since turned their attention back to Arsenal's Thomas Partey, but the Gunners'    46.5m ( £40m) price tag is proving prohibitive at this moment. Juve and other interested clubs could test Arsenal's resolve after the start of the 2023/24 season if he is not a guaranteed starter. With the departures of Kessie and Ousmane Dembele likely to be confirmed in the coming days, Barcelona are set to make a combined    65m ( £56m) in player sales for the duo and are now ramping up efforts to sign Joao Cancelo from Manchester City.\",\n",

New manager Ange Postecoglou has publicly called for a new defender to be signed this summer and Spurs have responded with a deal for Van de Ven, which could be worth up to    50m ( £43.5m) including add-ons. With the two teams now simply finalising the last details of a transfer, Van de Ven is heading to England to undergo a medical ahead of signing a long-term contract at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. The 22-year-old is set to become Spurs' fourth senior signing of the summer, following James Maddison, Guglielmo Vicario and Manor Solomon in joining the club. feed Despite the imminent deal for Van de Ven, 90min understands Spurs remain interested in Barcelona centre-back Clement Lenglet, who spent last season on loan at the club and has interest from across the globe.

Atletico Madrid are interested in signing Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg while Davinson Sanchez and Tanguy Ndombele are both targets for Galatasaray. Harry Kane is the subject of a    100m ( £88.5m) bid from Bayern Munich, with Spurs battling to try and convince the striker to sign a new contract.

       "  'text': 'FROM TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR STADIUM - The second peak of Harry Kane\\'s esteemed career coincided with Tottenham turning into a regressive and defensive team. From mid-2018 to the start of 2020, the striker became dogged by injuries, stripping him of a yard of pace and essentially pencilling him in for around ten games on the sidelines during any given season. By the time he effectively had back-to-back pre-seasons to reset his body during the pandemic, Spurs had fully committed to Jose Mourinho. Kane took on not only more of the scoring load alongside Son Heung-min, but also shouldered the creative burden. Through the Mourinho, Nuno Espirito Santo and Antonio Conte eras, Kane had to do everything in order to maintain Tottenham\\'s attacking potency. Enter Ange Postecoglou, a head coach drafted in to restore Spurs\\' long-forgotten attacking principles. Kane scored Spurs\\' first four in a 5-1 pre-season thrashing of Shakhtar Donetsk on Sunday as they flexed their new identity back on home soil. For the first time since the days of Mauricio Pochettino, Tottenham are looking to play on the front foot, to dominate the ball, to suffocate teams with possession and chances. When Kane was substituted towards the end of the match, he was met with a standing ovation, his iconic chant sung loudly from all four corners of the ground. Just as it had after each of his four goals, just as it had before a ball had even been kicked this afternoon. Today\\'s script may as well have been written by our new AI and ChatGPT overlords - once Kane was on the bench, a dark cloud emerged over the stadium. The heavens opened for five minutes before the sun began to reappear again. Heading into Sunday\\'s encounter, Spurs were continuing to mull over a new bid from Bayern Munich worth  £86m. It could well be their last in a saga which is nearing an end. If Tottenham choose to cash in on Kane, they stop any risk of him walking away for free next summer when his contract expires. It\\'s become clear that this is a risk they must take. Kane became the club\\'s all-time leading scorer back in February when he grabbed the only goal in a remarkable 1-0 victory at home to eventual treble-winners Manchester City. At full-time, he was celebrated and heralded for his remarkable achievements. That\\'s when it first sunk in - Tottenham Hotspur are Harry Kane, and Harry Kane is Tottenham Hotspur. manual If under-fire chairman Daniel Levy agrees to sell the club\\'s greatest ever player, he would tank his already negative approval rating to ungodly levels. If Kane walks for free, Spurs miss out on a hefty fee for the balance sheet, but at least he can say he kept the striker for all six years of his contract, tried his darnedest to extend that deal. It\\'s an incredibly rare feat for an academy graduate to become the face and soul of their boyhood club, especially in the super-club age. Tottenham should cherish this as long as they possibly can, kick the replacement striker can down the road for another year at least. If building a billion-pound stadium was meant to bridge the gap to the elite in the transfer market, it should also be able to absolve such a financial loss. There is, also, the Postecoglou factor. Kane scored 30 Premier League goals last season, his joint-best total despite sorry Spurs limping to an eighth place finish. In theory, he would be able to rival Erling Haaland for the Golden Boot in a team which creates bucketloads of chances rather than being drip-fed them. \"He\\'s a fantastic striker, one of the world\\'s best. I think the way the team plays will help him as well. He loves scoring goals and you saw today we created a load of chances and he was the beneficiary of that,\" Postecoglou said on Sunday. Tottenham still believe they could yet convince Kane to sign a new contract. This is more of a last chance than a last dance. The cruel world of modern football needs both to go through with it.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Brighton & Hove Albion have agreed a club record transfer fee with Ajax for Ghana forward Mohammed Kudus, sources have confirmed to 90min. Brighton have been tracking Kudus all summer, as 90min has already revealed, and now they have pushed ahead and finalised the terms of a deal with Ajax.  The Seagulls have met Ajax's asking price of    40m ( £34.5m) and that would surpass their existing club record move set earlier this summer when Joao Pedro completed his move from Watford. Kudus has now been given the green light to agree personal terms with Brighton, a detail that has not yet been finalised. Brighton are working hard to persuade him that moving to AMEX Stadium is his best next step, with manager Roberto De Zerbi convinced that the Ghanaian is an ideal signing. feed As 90min has previously revealed, Kudus has been targeted by Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester United in recent months - all have reached out to his representatives this summer and hold an interest. But none of them have made firm offers at this point, leaving Brighton in pole position to complete a deal. Kudus is currently in Germany with Ajax ahead of their pre-season clash with Borussia Dortmund on Sunday afternoon, but it remains to be seen if he will feature.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Pep Guardiola has challenged both Barcelona and Bayern Munich to make better offers for Bernardo Silva and Kyle Walker as the Manchester City manager prepares for a battle to keep hold of both players. The two City stars have been approached over summer exits but Guardiola does not want to weaken his squad any further, having already lost both Ilkay Gundogan and Riyad Mahrez during this transfer window. While Guardiola has long insisted he will not block any unhappy player from leaving, he warned both Barca and Bayern that City will not simply hand their players away for cheap. \"I don\\'t want any players who don\\'t want to be here but I\\'m an employee. I want to work with guys who want to stay and work with staff and players, but after we have to get a proper offer,\" Guardiola explained. \"If we don\\'t get a proper offer, he\\'s our player and we want him. If they want him, they will take a plane and come here and talk to our sporting director and CEO to make an agreement because three parts have to be there. \"For us to buy a player, just because we are Man City it is  £10-15m more expensive than other clubs all the time. If people want our really really important players, first they have to make an offer - and that hasn\\'t happened. When it happens, we will fight to extend the contract and be with us. That has happened with all of our players since day one.\" feed Guardiola went on to stress that the challenge of replacing two undisputed starters on a treble-winning side would be a costly operation and so those players will only be sold for substantial offers. \"When you win the Treble, it looks like the job is done. Players who are 32, 33 like Ilkay and Riyad say we arrived here for Premier Leagues and then people ask about the Champions League,\" he continued. \"Some players feel they want a new experience. I will not be the guy who says no - but they have to make an agreement with the important part of the club, the business. Make a deal and it happens. \"In the case of Bernardo and Kyle, we talk many times over the last months and even years how important they are, how we want them and we will continue to do so until the end. I don\\'t know what will happen but it won\\'t happen if the clubs don\\'t arrive because they are massively important players. \"When we lose those players we have to go to the market for the replacements and these players and they cost more than  £50m. We need that money to reimburse on other players to make the team as strong as possible to defend the crowns that we won and win games for our people.\"',\n",

       "  'text': \"Bayern Munich have drawn up a list of alternative options to Harry Kane in case their club record bid for the striker is rejected, 90min understands.  Sources confirmed to 90min last week that Bayern Munich had made a club record  £86m (   100m) bid to sign Tottenham talisman Kane this summer, having previously seen two offers rejected by Daniel Levy and co. in recent weeks.  As things stand, the Bundesliga holders are yet to receive a response from Tottenham regarding their most recent offer and have had no indication that it will be accepted.  Due to this uncertainty, Bayern officials have opted to draw up a list of alternative targets if a deal to sign Kane does not materliase.  feed 90min understands that one such alternative target is Dusan Vlahovic of Juventus. The forward asked to leave Juve in June - a request that was given its blessing by manager Massimiliano Allegri - following a disappointing 2022/23 campaign in Turin in which he managed just 10 Serie A goals.  Bayern have now made contact with Vlahovic's representatives in order to check in on the player's current situation at Juventus. 90min recently reported that Vlahovic's current employers have made attempts to get rid of the forward this summer already. The club has proposed a swap deal with Chelsea that would see the Serbian move to Stamford Bridge in exchange for Romelu Lukaku plus cash.  While Chelsea have held talks with Vlahovic's camp, they are not keen on the aforementioned deal as they are not interested in paying a fee in additiona to parting with Lukaku to get the forward.  Another striker that Bayern have shortlisted is France international and Eintracht Frankfurt star Randal Kolo Muani. The emerging talent has been linked with Bayern earlier this year, however 90min understands that Frankfurt's asking price of  £86m is not a fee that the club would be willing to pay.  Paris Saint-Germain are currently favourite to sign Kolo Muani, with the player already agreeing personal terms after talks accelerated over the weekend. Sources have confirmed to 90min that a deal is also likely to be agreed between the clubs soon, and a significant reason for that is PSG being willing offer Hugo Ekitike in part-exchange.  Kolo Muani is seen by PSG as an ideal replacement for Kylian Mbappe in plans for life without their superstar forward due to his current contract situation and desire to join Real Madrid. \",\n",

       "  'text': 'Newcastle United have finalised the signing of right-back Tino Livramento from Southampton. A fee of around  £35m, plus a further  £5m in add-ons, has been paid by Newcastle, with around 40% of that sum heading to Livramento\\'s boyhood club Chelsea as a result of a sell-on clause included in his 2021 switch to St Mary\\'s Stadium. Livramento has now put pen to paper on a five-year contract to become Newcastle\\'s fourth signing of the summer after Sandro Tonali, Harvey Barnes and Yankuba Minteh. \"I\\'m really excited to have signed for Newcastle United and I\\'m looking forward to playing in front of the fans,\" Livramento told club media. \"I was here for the games over the weekend; even though they were friendlies, there were so many fans and they were still so loud so I can\\'t wait to see what it feels like to play in front of them in a Premier League or Champions League game. \"The way the manager plays football is really attractive and I feel like it suits me as a player. And with how well the team did last season, the trajectory that we\\'re on now, I\\'m just looking forward to being a part of that. \"And to be able to learn from Kieran Trippier is another big thing for me; hopefully he teaches me how to become a better player and a better full-back.\" feed Manager Eddie Howe added: \"Tino is a very talented young player with an exciting future ahead of him so we are delighted to sign him. \"At 20, he already has lots of attributes that I admire but he also has the potential and drive to really grow with this team. I\\'m looking forward to working with him and to seeing him develop in a Newcastle shirt.\" Livramento will now compete for minutes at right-back with 32-year-old Trippier but is also comfortable further forward up the field.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Brighton & Hove Albion have made it clear to Moises Caicedo that he will not be sold unless their  £100m valuation of him is met, sources have confirmed to 90min. The Ecuador international is continuing to be courted by Chelsea, who have already seen two bids - the first worth  £70m and the second worth  £80m - knocked back by the Seagulls. 90min understands that Caicedo has confirmed his desire to leave Brighton on several occasions this summer. The club are keen to avoid him making his agitations public and so have decided to communicate why they are not entertaining Chelsea\\'s most recent offers. Brighton value Caicedo at a similar amount to Declan Rice, who recently signed for Arsenal from West Ham United for a British-record  £105m transfer fee, and this has been explained to the player and his representatives. Chelsea remain undeterred in their pursuit of Caicedo and will continue their advances. They have already agreed a deal to sign Robert Sanchez from Brighton this window and the clubs are on good terms despite their ongoing grievances over Caicedo and Levi Colwill, who put pen to paper on a new six-year contract at Stamford Bridge this week. feed When quizzed about Caicedo ahead of their pre-season friendly with Chelsea in the United States last month, Brighton head coach Roberto De Zerbi insisted the midfielder is going nowhere anytime soon and poked fun at the Blues\\' inability to qualify for Europe. \"It\\'s a clear situation at the moment. [Caicedo] stays with us until my owner changes his mind,\" De Zerbi said. \"I don\\'t know what can happen in the future, but if Moises leaves we have to find the right player because it\\'s difficult to replace a player as good as Moises. We have to substitute him with a great player because this year we play in the Europa League unlike Chelsea.\"',\n",
