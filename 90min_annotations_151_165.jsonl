{"id":151,"text":"Levi Colwill and Chelsea have reached an agreement for a new long-term contract to run for six years, 90min understands. The England Under-21 international spent the 2022\/23 season on loan at Brighton and impressed under Roberto De Zerbi.

Colwill now believes he will feature under the former Tottenham boss at Stamford Bridge, 90min understands, and has agreed the terms on a new contract with Chelsea which will runs into the late 2020s. The 20-year-old's current deal has two years left to run with the option of a further season. Brighton admitted defeat in their pursuit of Colwill as the west London side stood firm in their 'not for sale' stance before interest from Liverpool emerged. The Reds plucked him out as a top target as Colwill revealed his desire to play regularly. feed He said in early July: \"I'll speak to my family, speak to everyone I need to and make a decision. I've got to play at the end of the day, to hopefully get there and go to the next [England senior] camp.\" Pochettino's squad is still being streamlined before the transfer window closes but Thiago Silva, Benoit Badiashile and Trevoh Chalobah are among the Argentinian's alternative options to Colwill. Wesley Fofana has suffered another injury setback and won't feature in the early months of the 2023\/24 season. The Blues are closing in on a deal for Monaco centre back Axel Disasi, who will reunite with former teammate Badiashile if a transfer worth in the region of  £38m goes through.","label":[[0,12,"PER"],[17,24,"ORG"],[102,107,"ORG"],[125,132,"ORG"],[166,173,"DAT"],[192,200,"ORG"],[221,237,"PER"],[239,251,"ORG"],[270,277,"PER"],[368,373,"ORG"],[382,401,"PER"],[430,437,"PER"],[484,493,"ORG"],[502,517,"LOC"],[519,524,"ORG"],[586,593,"ORG"],[624,629,"DAT"],[725,733,"ORG"],[770,777,"PER"],[785,796,"LOC"],[865,874,"ORG"],[884,892,"ORG"],[928,935,"PER"],[997,1001,"DAT"],[1161,1168,"ORG"],[1184,1196,"PER"],[1268,1280,"PER"],[1282,1299,"PER"],[1304,1319,"PER"],[1334,1347,"ORG"],[1371,1378,"PER"],[1380,1393,"PER"],[1475,1482,"DAT"],[1491,1500,"ORG"],[1530,1536,"ORG"],[1549,1560,"PER"],[1600,1610,"PER"],[1649,1653,"MON"]],"Comments":[]}

{"id":160,"text":"Barcelona winger Ousmane Dembele is closing in on a move to French champions Paris Saint-Germain. 90min understands that he has agreed personal terms over a move back to his homeland and could even be unveiled as a new PSG player by the end of the week. It will bring an end to Dembele's six-year stint in Catalonia - a spell which has been largely underwhelming considering the promise he arrived with and the    145m ( £125m) total fee paid to Borussia Dortmund. PSG will fork over    50m ( £43m) for Dembele. Here are the players Barcelona could, and perhaps should, recruit with that sum. feed Head coach Xavi admitted earlier this week that he is in desperate need of a new natural right-back. \"The right-back is a position that we should look at again, and reinforce,\" he said. \"We have players who adapt but they are not in their natural positions. We will see how everything turns out and how we also fit into financial fair play.\" Few modern day full-backs fit the Barcelona mould the way that Joao Cancelo does. 90min reported on Wednesday that Barca are reigniting their interest in the Portugal international having tried but failed to sign him during the January transfer window. Barcelona would prefer to take Cancelo, who has four years left to run on his Manchester City contract, on an initial loan with an option to buy. Classic Barca trying to kick the can down the road. Right, let's move on to actual winger targets and not just any old player that Barcelona are actively talking about. 90min reported last month that Man City were battling PSG and RB Leipzig for Lyon winger Bradley Barcola, seeing him as a potential replacement for Riyad Mahrez. Barcola ended his breakout 2022\/23 season with seven goals and ten assists in 35 games for Lyon. If Barcelona want one of Europe's up-and-coming wide threats, then they should consider entering these sweepstakes. Villarreal winger Yeremy Pino is quickly announcing himself as one of Spanish football's top prospects. He has spent three full seasons in the Yellow Submarine's first team and was part of their Europa League-winning contingent of 2021, while he played a starring role in Spain's Nations League triumph in June. Pino's    80m ( £69m) release clause may prove prohibitive to Barcelona unless they shift a few more players, such as Tottenham targets Franck Kessie and Clement Lenglet. This would be a highly ambitious move and one that would stretch Barcelona in a financial sense, but Joao Felix is a player that would love to make the move and would certainly raise the technical levels of La Blaugrana. In fact, Felix recently discussed his desire to play for Barcelona in an interview with Fabrizio Romano, saying: \"I'd love to play for Barca. Barcelona has always been my first choice and I'd love to join Barca. It was always my dream since I was a kid. If it happens, it will be a dream come true for me.\" The endless link. Bernardo Silva has continually been tipped to leave Man City and it is usually Barcelona touted as the destination. Barca are still interested, but due to the aforementioned sale of Mahrez, 90min understands that Siva will be staying put at the Etihad Stadium. A versatile Ajax forward who has World Cup experience but has only been linked with a move to the Premier League? This sounds like something Barcelona should be all over. Mohammed Kudus has been the rare shining light for both club and country over the last year, turning on the style in poor Ajax and Ghana teams. 90min understands he is wanted by Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United, who could all probably out-bid Barcelona if push came to shove, unfortunately. Electrifying and fleet-footed, Jeremy Doku would make for a nice project to succeed Dembele. The 21-year-old hasn't quite kicked on since his marvellous performances at Euro 2020 but he has continually been linked with the continent's biggest clubs. Why couldn't it be Barcelona that takes a punt on his potential and upside?","label":[[0,9,"ORG"],[17,32,"PER"],[77,96,"ORG"],[98,103,"ORG"],[219,222,"ORG"],[278,287,"PER"],[306,315,"LOC"],[414,418,"MON"],[421,426,"MON"],[446,463,"ORG"],[465,468,"ORG"],[487,490,"MON"],[493,497,"MON"],[503,510,"PER"],[533,542,"ORG"],[609,613,"PER"],[974,983,"ORG"],[1003,1015,"PER"],[1022,1027,"ORG"],[1055,1060,"ORG"],[1098,1106,"ORG"],[1168,1175,"DAT"],[1193,1202,"ORG"],[1224,1231,"PER"],[1271,1286,"ORG"],[1347,1352,"ORG"],[1470,1479,"ORG"],[1508,1513,"ORG"],[1539,1547,"ORG"],[1562,1565,"ORG"],[1570,1580,"ORG"],[1585,1589,"ORG"],[1597,1612,"PER"],[1656,1668,"PER"],[1670,1677,"PER"],[1697,1704,"DAT"],[1761,1765,"ORG"],[1770,1779,"ORG"],[1792,1800,"LOC"],[1883,1893,"ORG"],[1901,1912,"PER"],[2026,2044,"ORG"],[2078,2091,"ORG"],[2114,2118,"DAT"],[2155,2162,"ORG"],[2163,2177,"ORG"],[2189,2193,"DAT"],[2205,2208,"MON"],[2211,2215,"MON"],[2257,2266,"ORG"],[2313,2322,"ORG"],[2331,2344,"PER"],[2349,2364,"PER"],[2431,2440,"ORG"],[2467,2477,"PER"],[2573,2585,"ORG"],[2596,2601,"PER"],[2644,2653,"ORG"],[2675,2690,"PER"],[2722,2727,"ORG"],[2729,2738,"ORG"],[2792,2797,"ORG"],[2912,2926,"PER"],[2964,2972,"ORG"],[2991,3000,"ORG"],[3028,3033,"ORG"],[3094,3100,"PER"],[3102,3107,"ORG"],[3125,3129,"PER"],[3157,3171,"LOC"],[3185,3189,"ORG"],[3206,3215,"ORG"],[3271,3285,"ORG"],[3314,3323,"ORG"],[3344,3358,"PER"],[3466,3470,"ORG"],[3475,3480,"ORG"],[3488,3493,"ORG"],[3522,3529,"ORG"],[3531,3538,"ORG"],[3543,3553,"ORG"],[3593,3602,"ORG"],[3672,3683,"PER"],[3725,3732,"PER"],[3810,3814,"ORG"],[3815,3819,"DAT"],[3910,3919,"ORG"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":161,"text":"Bayern Munich CEO Jan-Christian Dreesen and technical director Marco Neppe are due in England on Monday for their next meeting with Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy to discuss the future of Harry Kane, 90min understands. After holding a meeting with Levy earlier this month, Bayern had planned for a second set of face-to-face talks with the Spurs chairman last week but saw those plans pushed back at the last minute. Now, the two Bayern officials are expected to front a group of Bayern representatives which will touch down in London on Monday for their long-awaited talks over Kane's future. Two bids from Bayern have already been knocked back by Levy who, up to this point, has not named an asking price or even given any indication that he would be prepared to accept a bid for his talismanic striker this summer. However, with Kane entering the final year of his contract, Spurs owner Joe Lewis has intervened and is understood to have told Levy to authorise a sale if an agreement to extend Kane's contract cannot be struck. feed A club-record bid from Bayern, whose transfer record currently stands at the    80m paid to sign Lucas Hernandez from Atletico Madrid in 2019, is expected to arrive imminently, with the German side determined to take advantage of Kane's expiring contract to get a deal done. There has been plenty of speculation over the reason for the cancellation of last week's meeting between Bayern and Spurs but the German side's president, Herbert Hainer, insisted there was nothing malicious going on. \"Sometimes people read too much into normal processes,\" Hainer told TZ. \"What I can say is that Daniel Levy is a professional.

{"id":162,"text":"Tottenham have agreed to meet the  £13m release clause of Rosario Central youngster Alejo Veliz, 90min understands. Spurs recently opened talks with the Argentine club for 19-year-old Veliz, who had also attracted interest from AC Milan, Roma, Salernitana and Nottingham Forest. The 19-year-old rose to global prominence during the 2023 FIFA Under-20 World Cup as part of Argentina's squad, scoring three times before his side were knocked out in the last 16 by Nigeria. Rival interest had arisen from Serie A and the Premier League but 90min has been told the young striker made Tottenham his preferred destination which has helped with negotiations. A long-term contract is in the works and no issues are expected to flare up between Veliz and Spurs in that department. Veliz scored 11 times in the 2023 Argentine Primera Division, only two fewer than joint-leading scorers Pablo Vegetti and Michael Santos. He made his debut for Central in 2021 during a Copa Sudamericana clash with Deportivo Tachira and has since netted 19 goals in total for the club. feed Discussions are now being held over Veliz's short-term future. Rosario are keen to keep the teenager - who turns 20 in September - until January on loan and possibly beyond. Tottenham have long needed back-up options for Harry Kane, whose own future in north London is under extreme scrutiny with Bayern Munich confident of completing a deal for the England captain. Richarlison suffered an injury-hit first campaign with Spurs but would be the obvious replacement up front if Kane does leave before the season starts. A central defender is still being targeted with talks advancing for Wolfsburg's Micky van de Ven as new head coach Ange Postecoglou looks to fix a defence that conceded 63 Premier League goals last season. Out of favour Barcelona duo Franck Kessie and Clement Lenglet - the latter of whom spent last season in north London - remain targets, while Denmark international Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg could be shipped off to Atletico Madrid.","label":[[0,9,"ORG"],[35,39,"MON"],[58,73,"ORG"],[84,95,"PER"],[97,102,"ORG"],[116,121,"ORG"],[153,162,"ORG"],[184,189,"PER"],[228,236,"ORG"],[238,242,"ORG"],[244,255,"ORG"],[260,277,"ORG"],[332,336,"DAT"],[337,360,"ORG"],[372,383,"ORG"],[462,469,"LOC"],[502,509,"ORG"],[518,532,"ORG"],[537,542,"ORG"],[580,589,"ORG"],[736,741,"PER"],[746,751,"ORG"],[772,777,"PER"],[801,805,"DAT"],[816,832,"ORG"],[876,889,"PER"],[894,908,"PER"],[932,939,"ORG"],[943,947,"DAT"],[957,974,"ORG"],[986,1003,"ORG"],[1098,1105,"PER"],[1125,1132,"PER"],[1181,1190,"DAT"],[1199,1206,"DAT"],[1236,1245,"ORG"],[1283,1293,"PER"],[1315,1327,"LOC"],[1359,1372,"ORG"],[1412,1419,"ORG"],[1429,1440,"PER"],[1484,1489,"ORG"],[1539,1543,"PER"],[1649,1660,"ORG"],[1661,1677,"PER"],[1696,1712,"PER"],[1753,1767,"ORG"],[1801,1810,"ORG"],[1815,1828,"PER"],[1833,1848,"PER"],[1891,1903,"LOC"],[1928,1935,"ORG"],[1950,1971,"PER"],[1996,2011,"ORG"]],"Comments":[]}

Barca head coach Xavi and new club captain Sergi Roberto have both spoken of their surprise and disappointment of Dembele's fresh intentions to leave. Sources have now confirmed to 90min that PSG are closing in on the signing of Dembele after paying a    50m ( £43m) release clause in his Barcelona contract.

{"id":165,"text":"Barcelona midfielder Nico Gonzalez has completed a transfer to Portuguese giants Porto. Spain Under-21 international Nico made his Barca debut in 2021 under Ronald Koeman, having renewed his contract that year until 2024 with a whopping    500m release clause. His deal at Camp Nou was then extended to 2026 before departing for a loan spell with Valencia. Things went poorly at the Mestalla as Los Che narrowly avoided relegation in 2022\/23, with Nico scoring once in 26 La Liga appearances. feed Barca have now announced his permanent    8.5m departure to Porto, who finished second in the Primeira Liga, and have a buy-back clause should they wish to bring the midfielder back to Camp Nou. The La Liga giants also retain a percentage of any future transfer fee for Nico. New summer arrivals Ilkay Gundogan and Oriol Romeu made Nico's pathway to starting XI football more difficult under Xavi, who already had the likes of Pedri, Gavi, Frenkie de Jong, Sergi Roberto and Franck Kessie to choose from in midfield. He is the latest Barca player to leave this window following the previous exits of Sergio Busquets, Jordi Alba, Samuel Umtiti and Alex Collado.
