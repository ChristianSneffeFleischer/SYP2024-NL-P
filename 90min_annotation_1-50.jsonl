{"id":3,"text":"Manchester United are in talks with Bayern Munich over the possible transfer of 2018 World Cup-winning defender Benjamin Pavard, 90min understands. The versatile Pavard, capable of playing as a centre-back or right-back, joined Bayern in 2019 and has entered the final year of his contract at the Allianz Arena. With Maguire in the process of leaving Old Trafford before next month   s transfer deadline, Pavard had been among a number of options to replace the former captain. As 90min revealed last week, United are preparing to enter the transfer market once Maguire   s exit is completed. The England international had initially wanted to stay and fight for his place, despite slipping down the pecking order last season and losing the captaincy early in pre-season. feed But the Red Devils agreed a  £30m fee with fellow Premier League side West Ham United. Talks have continued to hammer out the details of the proposed deal, although things have progressed slower than had been hoped.

Pavard has been offered to United, with Nice   s Jean-Clair Todibo, ex-Ajax defender Perr Schuurs, Jarrad Branthwaite of Everton, one-time Tottenham target Edmond Tapsoba and Benfica   s Antonio Silva all considered by the club to replace Maguire. But it is the Pavard path on which United are now progressing and 90min understands that negotiations with Bayern over the transfer fee are taking place. The perennial German champions value the Frenchman at  £30m (   35m), which is higher than the  £25.9m (   30m) that United have so far proposed.

{"id":4,"text":"Moises Caicedo is no stranger to a drawn-out transfer saga. Years before Chelsea began peppering Brighton with dizzying offers only to be outbid by Liverpool, before the Blues bid  £115m to secure his services this week, Caicedo was the subject of a multi-club tussle while he was still in Ecuador with Independiente del Valle. Manchester United, AC Milan, Brighton, Chelsea and Belgian side Club Brugge were all interested in the midfielder after a rapid ascension in senior South American football. Three separate agencies also tried to represent Caicedo and get a slice of any potentially lucrative deal. Ultimately, Brighton cut through the chaos to snag Caicedo for just  £4.5m in 2021. After less than 50 starts for the Seagulls, the 21-year-old has now become one of the most expensive players in the history of the sport. Here's how Caicedo's  £115m move to Chelsea compares to the game's other costly sagas. Chelsea confirmed the signing of Caicedo after one of the most dramatic transfer sagas of recent times. The Blues had been pursuing the midfielder for the majority of the summer, however had been unwilling to make a bid over  £80m until Liverpool agreed to fork out  £111m for his services.  Despite an agreement between Liverpool and Brighton being struck, Caicedo was unwilling to agree to a move to Anfield, opening the door for Chelsea to swoop in and have a  £115m bid accepted for his services.  The midfielder has now put pen to paper on an eight-year deal at Stamford Bridge.  Caicedo has become the most expensive signing for Chelsea and any other British club. But where does he rank on a global scale?

Even though Caicedo's fee has scratched nine digits, Neymar's move to PSG comfortably remains the most expensive in history, with the Ligue 1 giants paying  £198m for the forward's services.  Neymar's PSG teammate Kylian Mbappe is second on the list but could have moved into top spot after Al Hilal's  £259m offer was accepted by the French champions.

{"id":5,"text":"Saudi Pro League director of football Michael Emenalo claims the competition can position itself as one of the world's best within the next two years by targeting 'exceptional players only' The former technical director of Chelsea assumed his role in July and is continuing the Pro League's significant  £400m investment initiative. This strategy has enticed players such as Karim Benzema, Jordan Henderson, Riyad Mahrez, and Roberto Firmino to join Saudi Arabian clubs this summer. So far, the majority of top stars heading to Saudi Arabia, including Benzema, N'Golo Kante and Cristiano Ronaldo, have been in the latter stages of their respective careers. At 26, Ruben Neves is one of the exceptions to the trend and arguably not in the same bracket of star anyway. Richard Masters, chief executive of the Premier League, recently shared that he isn't overly worried about Saudi Arabia's unrestricted spending. However, Emenalo cautioned that there are essentially no bounds to the country's willingness to invest in football players.  \"I would love  to have Kylian Mbappe here. I would love to have Harry Kane here. The league would like all the top players,\" he said. Indeed, Mbappe has already been the subject of world record  £259m bid from Al Hilal that was accepted by Paris Saint-Germain, although the plater himself wasn't interested in the move. manual \"In a couple of years, this will become a league for exceptional players only. It will become a league for those who are at the top of their game. We have the resources, and we   re going to use them,\" Emenalo said. \"I don   t think it is going to take the same amount of time that it took the [English] Premier League to get there for us to establish ourselves.\" Emenalo emphasised that the Saudi Pro League's aim is not to undermine the Premier League in a manner similar to LIV Golf and the PGA Tour and hopes that elite football's established order in Europe will eventually be less apprehensive and collaborate with them.    The European leagues, especially the Premier League, are very strong, they have no reason to be scared,    he added.    I think there   s panic in some areas, but this is from a misunderstanding of what we are trying to do.    I saw what [Jurgen] Klopp and what [Pep] Guardiola said [about the Pro League]. One is a coach I absolutely admire and the other is a good friend of mine in Pep. First, I hope they don   t talk themselves out of a job [in Saudi Arabia] in the future. I understand their concerns. Our goal is to work together with all the leagues and be a brotherhood in the football industry.

{"id":22,"text":"Brighton and Hove Albion CEO Paul Barber has confessed Moises Caicedo's decision to reject a transfer to Liverpool in favour of joining Chelsea came as a surprise.

{"id":23,"text":"Paris Saint-Germain have confirmed that Kylian Mbappe has been allowed to return to first-team training after \"constructive and positive discussions\" regarding his future.  90min reported earlier this week that Mbappe had reiterated his desire to stay at PSG beyond this summer despite not taking up his option to trigger a clause which would extend his current contract at the club until the summer of 2025.

{"id":26,"text":"Real Madrid are prepared to end their pursuit of Sevilla goalkeeper Yassine Bounou after seeing his asking price raised, 90min understands, with Chelsea's Kepa Arrizabalaga now among the club's top targets. Madrid lost usual starter Thibaut Courtois to an ACL injury earlier this week, with the Belgian stopper set to spend the majority of the coming campaign on the sidelines as a result. Sevilla's Yassine Bounou was initially targeted as a replacement after an asking price of    20m ( £17.3m) was quoted, but sources have confirmed to 90min that Sevilla are now demanding upwards of    30m (25.9m) and Madrid are prepared to walk away as a result.

{"id":27,"text":"Real Madrid have suffered a devastating blow on the eve of the new La Liga season, losing their goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois to an anterior cruciate ligament injury. The Belgian colossus has been pivotal to Madrid's success in recent years and Carlo Ancelotti hasn't had to think twice about who to start between the sticks. Courtois has been one of the world's leading shot-stoppers and his absence will be sorely felt by the Spanish side next season. Ancelotti needs a replacement for his number one, and has looked towards his old club Chelsea for a solution. Madrid have expressed their interest in taking Blues goalkeeper Kepa on loan for next season, a deal which Chelsea may be willing to sanction given their recent acquisition of Robert Sanchez. Here's why Real Madrid want Kepa at the Bernabeu. Considering Real Madrid will be relying on Andriy Lunin in their season opener against Athletic Club, Kepa's experience and quality would be a welcome addition to Los Blancos' squad. The Spanish stopper managed 39 appearances after reclaiming his starting spot from Edouard Mendy at Chelsea last year, including two encounters with Real Madrid in the Champions League quarter-finals. Kepa performed admirably given the criticism he has received in previous seasons, establishing himself as the club's guaranteed number one. Kepa ranked in the top 24% of Premier League goalkeepers for saves (3.16), save percentage (73.3%) and goals against (1.16) per 90 last campaign. He also boasted a +0.18 rate when it came to post-shot expected goals  minus goals conceded, suggesting that Kepa was performing significantly above average in terms of his shot-stopping. His ability and competence outside of his own penalty area could also be crucial for Madrid. He ranked in the top 17% of Premier League goalkeepers for number of defensive actions per 90 outside of his box (1.82), showcasing his quality in sweeping up opposition balls over the top. While not as significant in an Ancelotti team, it will still allow Madrid to press higher up the pitch, knowing Kepa can sniff out danger when direct balls are played in behind the defence.  Overall, Kepa provides Madrid with a cost-effective and experienced option. Add this to the fact that he is Spanish and knows La Liga intimately, and it seems like something of a no-brainer for Madrid, especially if they are only exploring a loan deal.

Attention has therefore turned to Kepa, who has also interested Bayern Munich, but Real Madrid don't want to rush into making a signing given the multitude of options potentially available to them. Kepa, however, is under serious consideration, with Courtois set for a long spell on the sidelines. At present, Madrid are said to only be interested in loaning the 28-year-old from Chelsea, although such a deal could have an option to buy or mandatory buy clause inserted into it. Given Chelsea's expensive pursuit of Moises Caicedo and Romeo Lavia, a permanent deal that could recoup some transfer funds may be preferential.","label":[[0,11,"ORG"],[67,74,"ORG"],[107,123,"PER"],[206,214,"ORG"],[243,258,"PER"],[324,332,"PER"],[452,461,"PER"],[538,545,"ORG"],[562,568,"ORG"],[609,614,"ORG"],[626,630,"PER"],[669,676,"ORG"],[738,752,"PER"],[765,776,"ORG"],[782,786,"PER"],[794,802,"LOC"],[816,827,"ORG"],[847,859,"PER"],[891,904,"ORG"],[906,912,"PER"],[967,979,"ORG"],[1070,1083,"PER"],[1087,1094,"ORG"],[1136,1147,"ORG"],[1155,1171,"ORG"],[1188,1192,"PER"],[1328,1332,"PER"],[1351,1354,"PCT"],[1358,1372,"ORG"],[1420,1425,"PCT"],[1583,1587,"PER"],[1747,1753,"ORG"],[1776,1779,"PCT"],[1783,1797,"ORG"],[1976,1985,"PER"],[2012,2018,"ORG"],[2057,2061,"PER"],[2145,2149,"PER"],[2159,2165,"ORG"],[2262,2269,"ORG"],[2330,2336,"ORG"],[2441,2448,"ORG"],[2457,2462,"PCT"],[2466,2479,"ORG"],[2487,2492,"PCT"],[2496,2511,"ORG"],[2519,2524,"PCT"],[2528,2540,"ORG"],[2547,2552,"PCT"],[2578,2583,"ORG"],[2637,2644,"ORG"],[2656,2670,"PER"],[2808,2812,"PER"],[2838,2851,"ORG"],[2857,2868,"ORG"],[2972,2976,"PER"],[3024,3032,"PER"],[3084,3090,"ORG"],[3154,3161,"ORG"],[3260,3269,"ORG"],[3291,3305,"PER"],[3310,3321,"PER"]],"Comments":[]}

Liverpool then looked to have won the race with a  £111m offer, before Chelsea came back to the table.","label":[[0,7,"ORG"],[54,68,"PER"],[74,82,"ORG"],[96,101,"MON"],[122,129,"MON"],[139,153,"PER"],[157,164,"DAT"],[166,173,"PER"],[211,226,"LOC"],[233,237,"DAT"],[262,269,"ORG"],[379,386,"ORG"],[549,556,"ORG"],[607,623,"PER"],[628,643,"PER"],[651,657,"PER"],[777,796,"PER"],[809,815,"PER"],[954,969,"LOC"],[1011,1018,"PER"],[1031,1039,"ORG"],[1043,1047,"DAT"],[1066,1069,"MON"],[1128,1137,"ORG"],[1141,1148,"LOC"],[1210,1224,"ORG"],[1362,1369,"ORG"],[1394,1401,"PER"],[1463,1470,"ORG"],[1503,1507,"MON"],[1509,1518,"ORG"],[1560,1565,"MON"],[1580,1587,"ORG"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":36,"text":"From Stamford Bridge - The stage was set perfectly. Chelsea and Liverpool had been going at it hammer and tongs in the transfer market in the week leading up to their Premier League fixture at Stamford Bridge on Sunday afternoon. Moises Caicedo was, and remains, the object of their desires. The Brighton midfielder will become the most expensive player in Premier League history when he does eventually transfer, at some point in the coming week, you'd expect, with Liverpool initially having an offer accepted of  £111m for the Ecuadorian.  Caicedo has made his decision known that he'd prefer the move to west London, triggering public embarrassment for Liverpool - a club usually so efficient and proficient with their dealings to buy and sell first team players.  feed Having won the transfer pending an agreement with Brighton, which will be in the region of a quite ridiculous  £115m, Chelsea had hoped to present the player to their home support with a deal completed in the days leading up to their 1-1 draw on Sunday. One for the social media channels to rack up the engagements on, y'know, but it wasn't to be. Caicedo wasn't there, but good grief did both teams want him to be, with the need for a dominating defensive midfielder desperately obvious for both throughout a frantic, chaotic 101 minutes of opening weekend action. But what did Sunday's game tell us about which team more desperately needs to break the British transfer record to sign a player with only 53 appearances in English football to his name? Liverpool might need a defensive midfielder, will try to confirm as and when pic.twitter.com\/gg4CVUB0wd At least new Chelsea boss Mauricio Pochettino settled for pragmatism (in look and feel at least) as he attempted to cover the lack of defensive presence in midfield by naming a back three. Axel Disasi was named for a competitive debut alongside returning loanee Levi Colwill, with Thiago Silva relied upon in the middle. It suggested at least he was looking to stem the tide and not give too much away - though insisted post-match that his team played with four at the back. For Jurgen Klopp, it was back to gung-ho and heavy metal. You'd suppose you can't name a six in your team if you don't possess one, but Klopp went down the route of \"screw it\" with his team sheet, naming new signings Dominik Szoboszlai and Alexis Mac Allister alongside Cody Gakpo in the most attacking of midfield units.  Mac Allister was tasked with being the deepest midfielder, operating with Trent Alexander-Arnold drifting in from the right full back slot. Who needs Moises Caicedo more? Liverpool, because I'm not changing my system Caicedo is largely praised for his ability to cover ground, shuttling across to cover spaces left behind his teammates with the licence to attack. Fair to say both teams could have really utilised him here - first half especially - and that whichever team gets him will have a gem for next decade in a dream scenario. The opening 45 was a story of Pure, Unadulterated Barclays: Chaos Edition, with both teams' defences breached. Liverpool fired a warning after 12 minutes when Mohamed Salah struck the bar, but hit the front before the 20th minute after some excellent work from the Egyptian. Chelsea left far too much space for Salah to take possession and far too much space behind their back line for Luis Diaz to tap in at the far post. Plenty at fault but good defensive midfielders stop breakaways at source. There'd have been little Caicedo could've done about the way Chelsea's equaliser came about - this was a story of space behind the back line and defenders switching off - but both teams had the ball in the net on a further occasion each only to see efforts ruled out for offside. In the second half, Conor Gallagher far better embraced the role he'd been given for the day as a midfield screen, while 90min POTM Enzo Fernandez grew in stature throughout with an imperious performance in possession. It meant the hosts shaded the second half, controlled the lions' share of possession and the chaos of the game had subsided...barring a frantic final few minutes. Who needs Moises Caicedo more?  Draw, because Conor Gallagher can't play like he did in the second half every week and Liverpool do not own a senior defensive midfielder WhoScored have Chelsea's pass completion at 88% compared to the visitors' 80%, but that could have something to do with Liverpool's direct style on the day and push to get the ball forward. There were spells throughout the first half and before Chelsea found their feet where Liverpool were cutting the hosts open with direct passes through the middle and through the channels, but over the course of the game Chelsea stomped it out. The Blues themselves found moments to penetrate with vertical passes through the middle and often threatened with charges up the pitch from players in possession - they could have won the match late on following a break in that manner. You'd have to chalk Chelsea's name on the board for better use of the ball today on the whole; namely because Enzo Fernandez is very good at football. But both teams have holes to fill. Who needs Moises Caicedo more? Liverpool, because they don't have a six and won't change their system During his time at Brighton, Caicedo was often seen covering in the absence of others at right back - and players nowadays - especially those who cost north of  £100m - are hugely valued for versatility. Chelsea won't need that kind of cover given their options at right-sided centre back and with Malo Gusto joining the party over the summer and with Reece James named as club captain. Chelsea do need options and numbers in midfield but Caicedo's name is a dream scenario and the completion of a midfield unit. Liverpool, meanwhile, only have 18-year-old Stefan Bajcetic as a natural presence in defensive midfield - and nobody else following the sales of Fabinho and Jordan Henderson, while they rely on Ibrahima Konate to cover three or four positions when Alexander-Arnold steps into midfield and Liverpool don't have the ball. The Reds are in desperate need of a defensive presence in the centre and it would add levels to their game very quickly if they found the right fit. Who needs Moises Caicedo more? Liverpool Based on the evidence of today - from Jurgen Klopp's decision to play Alexis Mac Allister at six while he wore 10 on his back, from Mauricio Pochettino's decision to use a 3-5-2, from the second half performances of Conor Gallagher and Enzo Fernandez and from the apparent ease for opposing teams to progress through Liverpool's centre, you'd have to say it's Liverpool. Their bid has been accepted by Brighton but advances have been halted by the player, with Chelsea now primed to step in and complete the transfer in the week to come. They may even sign up Southampton's Romeo Lavia to really take the biscuit - though Klopp's team are to fight to the end on that one too with no decision from the player yet. If Chelsea do manage to secure their top target for the summer, they'll have a midfield unit of Caicedo and Enzo which will be the envy of the Premier League for seasons to come. It'll have cost in the region of  £220m for the two, but if you're going for best in class, you've got to spend. Who needs Moises Caicedo more? Liverpool, but they're not getting him are they?","label":[[5,20,"LOC"],[52,59,"ORG"],[64,73,"ORG"],[167,181,"ORG"],[193,208,"LOC"],[230,244,"PER"],[296,304,"ORG"],[357,371,"ORG"],[467,476,"ORG"],[516,521,"MON"],[543,550,"PER"],[608,619,"LOC"],[657,666,"ORG"],[824,832,"ORG"],[885,890,"MON"],[1122,1129,"PER"],[1527,1536,"ORG"],[1644,1651,"ORG"],[1657,1676,"PER"],[1820,1831,"PER"],[1893,1905,"PER"],[1912,1924,"PER"],[2110,2122,"PER"],[2242,2247,"PER"],[2323,2341,"PER"],[2346,2365,"PER"],[2376,2386,"PER"],[2429,2441,"PER"],[2503,2525,"PER"],[2579,2593,"PER"],[2600,2609,"ORG"],[2646,2653,"PER"],[3014,3022,"ORG"],[3075,3084,"ORG"],[3123,3136,"PER"],[3182,3193,"TIM"],[3239,3246,"ORG"],[3275,3280,"PER"],[3350,3359,"PER"],[3486,3493,"PER"],[3522,3531,"ORG"],[3761,3776,"PER"],[3862,3867,"ORG"],[3873,3887,"PER"],[4133,4147,"PER"],[4169,4184,"PER"],[4242,4251,"ORG"],[4293,4302,"ORG"],[4308,4317,"ORG"],[4337,4340,"PCT"],[4367,4370,"PCT"],[4413,4424,"ORG"],[4538,4545,"ORG"],[4569,4578,"ORG"],[4703,4710,"ORG"],[4727,4736,"ORG"],[4983,4992,"ORG"],[5073,5087,"PER"],[5159,5173,"PER"],[5180,5189,"ORG"],[5270,5278,"ORG"],[5280,5287,"PER"],[5412,5417,"MON"],[5455,5462,"ORG"],[5549,5559,"PER"],[5603,5614,"PER"],[5638,5645,"ORG"],[5690,5699,"PER"],[5764,5773,"ORG"],[5808,5823,"PER"],[5909,5916,"PER"],[5921,5937,"PER"],[5958,5973,"PER"],[6012,6028,"PER"],[6053,6062,"ORG"],[6084,6092,"ORG"],[6243,6257,"PER"],[6264,6273,"ORG"],[6312,6326,"ORG"],[6344,6363,"PER"],[6406,6427,"PER"],[6490,6505,"PER"],[6510,6524,"PER"],[6591,6602,"ORG"],[6634,6643,"ORG"],[6676,6684,"ORG"],[6735,6742,"ORG"],[6834,6847,"ORG"],[6848,6859,"PER"],[6896,6903,"PER"],[6990,6997,"ORG"],[7083,7090,"PER"],[7095,7099,"PER"],[7130,7144,"ORG"],[7200,7205,"MON"],[7289,7303,"PER"],[7310,7319,"ORG"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":37,"text":"Erik ten Hag has told Harry Maguire to leave Manchester United if he is not willing to fight for his place in the starting lineup. Maguire fell out of favour under Ten Hag during his first season in charge, making just eight Premier League starts under the new manager. Last month, the defender was stripped of the club captaincy, with the armband being given to Bruno Fernandes ahead of the new campaign. All of this has notably led to a huge amount of speculation around the player's long-term future at Old Trafford, and with West Ham having seen a bid of  £30m now accepted by the Red Devils it looks as though Maguire is set to leave the club. 90min understands that although Maguire hasn't been fully convinced of leaving Man Utd this summer, he is open to a move to West Ham and is likely to accept their contract offer.  Speaking about defender's Man Utd future and seemingly impending transfer to the Hammers, Ten Hag told the press ahead of the club's Premier League season-opener against Wolves that, if Maguire isn't willing to fight for his place in the team, then he should leave. \"For Harry, he has to fight for his place. He has the ability to be a top-class centre-back, he is the best for England so why shouldn't he be the best for us?\" Ten Hag said. \"But he has to prove it. When he is not confident enough to go with that fight then he has to go, he has to make the decision. But I am happy with him. feed \"We don't have a squad with 11 players. Last year proved definitely we need all the players, so you need high level players who are maybe not starting but that can change, so there is an internal competition and everyone has to fight for his place. For many players that counts, when they are good they will get their games but no one can play all the games and finally, you find out what is the best team. \"In the squad now, all the positions are double and every player has the perspective to fight for his place. Then you have to show with your contribution it's the best team performance. It is up to the players if they have the game time or less.\" In light of Maguire's potential departure, 90min recently reported that Man Utd are set to enter the transfer market in search of some centre-back cover. Names that have been linked already include Jean Clair-Todibo, Perr Schuurs, Jarrad Branthwaite and Edmond Tapsoba.

The Ligue 1 club made Neymar the most expensive footballer in history back in 2017, signing the player for  £190m.  While the Brazilian won five Ligue 1 titles in Paris, he struggled with a number of muscle injuries throughout his time at the club, failing to make more than 22 league appearances in any of his six campaigns with the club.

{"id":40,"text":"Chelsea are moving closer to a deal to sign Crystal Palace midfielder Michael Olise, 90min understands. Arsenal and Manchester City were both intrigued by news of a  £35m release clause in Olise's contract but, as 90min reported last month, Chelsea have long been confident they would win the race for his signature. Talks over personal terms have been ongoing for weeks and now sources have confirmed to 90min that Chelsea have taken a step forward in their negotiations with Palace as they seek to get an agreement over the line. Olise, who can play both in midfield and out on the wing, spent several years in the Chelsea academy before leaving aged 14, while his brother Richard, 18, is part of the Blues' Under-21 setup currently. feed Chelsea hope to finalise Olise's signing soon but are in no rush to do so as the 21-year-old is currently sidelined with a hamstring injury he picked up at this summer's Under-21 European Championships. Olise is not expected to return to the pitch until the end of September at the earliest so there is no imminent deadline to get the Frenchman registered for any upcoming fixtures, unlike midfielder Romeo Lavia, whose transfer from Southampton could be completed in time for the Belgian to face West Ham United on Sunday alongside fellow new arrival Moises Caicedo. 90min understands that Chelsea are expected to end their midfield rebuild once the moves for Lavia and Olise are finalised, with the Blues set to switch their attention to finding a goalkeeper to replace Kepa Arrizabalaga, who joined Real Madrid on loan and admitted during his presentation that he wants to stay in Spain beyond this season.

The Brazil superstar will bring to an end his six-year stay in the French capital after agreeing terms on a two-year contract with the Saudi Pro League side.

{"id":44,"text":"Manchester United   s hopes of offloading fringe midfielder Donny van de Beek to Real Sociedad have taken a hit amid stalled talks, 90min understands. Van de Beek was a Ballon d   Or nominee in 2019 thanks to his starring role for Erik ten Hag   s Ajax team on their journey to getting within seconds of the Champions League final. But a cruel combination of difficulty adapting to more physical English football, injuries, poor form and a lack of confidence has seen the Dutchman struggle to make an impact at Old Trafford, even after being reunited with former boss and mentor Ten Hag last season. As 90min has reported, Van de Beek has been exploring his options to leave throughout the summer, with his agents in contact with a number of European clubs. That follow decisions from Ten Hag, who retains a healthy relationship, and the club to give him permission to move on. In addition to AC Milan, Inter and Roma, there was Premier League interest from Wolves, Nottingham Forest and Crystal Palace, plus from Celtic north of the Scottish border. feed An offer from Real Sociedad came in early August, with the Spanish club proposing a loan with option to buy ahead of their return to the Champions League this season. However, a problem has arisen. 90min understands that the two clubs have so far been unable to come to an agreement over the exact make up of the deal. Van de Beek himself remains particularly keen and so there is still an underlying expectation that it will happen, but there is now a threat of Real Sociedad potentially walking away altogether. United have already successfully offloaded Fred to Fenerbahce, raising  £13m in the process, and departures from the midfield are important to free up space on the wage bill as the club continues to target Fiorentina and Morocco star Sofyan Amrabat.","label":[[0,17,"ORG"],[60,77,"PER"],[81,94,"ORG"],[132,137,"ORG"],[151,162,"PER"],[194,198,"DAT"],[231,243,"PER"],[248,252,"ORG"],[308,324,"ORG"],[511,523,"LOC"],[579,586,"PER"],[603,608,"ORG"],[623,634,"PER"],[785,792,"PER"],[893,901,"ORG"],[903,908,"ORG"],[913,917,"ORG"],[929,943,"ORG"],[958,964,"ORG"],[966,983,"ORG"],[988,1002,"ORG"],[1014,1020,"ORG"],[1070,1083,"ORG"],[1098,1104,"DAT"],[1193,1209,"ORG"],[1254,1259,"ORG"],[1375,1386,"PER"],[1519,1532,"ORG"],[1570,1576,"ORG"],[1613,1617,"PER"],[1621,1631,"ORG"],[1642,1646,"MON"],[1776,1786,"ORG"],[1791,1798,"ORG"],[1804,1818,"PER"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":45,"text":"Bayern Munich have completed the long-awaited signing of Harry Kane from Tottenham Hotspur. The 30-year-old has signed a four-year contract with the Bundesliga giants, bringing the curtain down on a glittering Spurs career that saw him usurp Jimmy Greaves as the club's all-time record goalscorer. Kane has been Bayern's primary target this summer, as the Bavarians look to finally replace the guaranteed goals of Robert Lewandowski, and have finally got a deal over the line after months of negotiating with Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy. 90min understands that Bayern will pay    100m ( £86.4m) to Tottenham for Kane, but the deal could be worth more should potential add-ons be triggered. \"Bayern is one of the biggest clubs in the world, and I   ve always said that I want to compete and prove myself at the highest level during my career,\" Kane told Bayern's media team after confirmation of the move. \"This club is defined by its winning mentality.\" Kane leaves the Premier League widely regarded as one of the greatest strikers of the modern era. A Spurs academy graduate quickly dubbed 'one of our own', he broke into the first team towards the back end of the 2013\/14 season, before scoring 21 Premier League goals and 31 in all competitions the following year. manual The club's famous number 10 shirt was soon his, and Kane continued to deliver the goods for Tottenham in addition to becoming one of England's best players. He won multiple Premier League Player of the Month awards (seven in total) and was named in the PFA Premier League Team of the Year five times. Kane also bagged the Premier League Golden Boot three times, though his career-best 30 goals during the 2017\/18 season was not enough to earn him the gong ahead of Mohamed Salah. That goal haul was matched last season despite Tottenham's struggles in the Premier League, and it was apparent that Kane, who came close to leaving the club a couple of years ago to join Manchester City, may need to leave in order to fulfil his trophy ambitions. With just a year left on his contract, Real Madrid and Manchester United were expected to pounce, but it's Bayern Munich who have got a deal over the line after months of courting. Kane is believed to have been registered in time to play in Saturday's night German Super Cup final against RB Leipzig - a game that could see Kane lift the first silverware of his club career less than 24 hours after arriving in Germany.","label":[[0,13,"ORG"],[57,67,"PER"],[73,90,"ORG"],[149,159,"ORG"],[210,215,"ORG"],[242,255,"PER"],[298,302,"PER"],[312,320,"ORG"],[414,432,"PER"],[509,518,"ORG"],[528,539,"PER"],[541,546,"ORG"],[564,570,"ORG"],[583,587,"MON"],[590,596,"MON"],[601,610,"ORG"],[615,619,"PER"],[694,700,"ORG"],[846,850,"PER"],[856,864,"ORG"],[957,961,"PER"],[973,987,"ORG"],[1057,1062,"ORG"],[1170,1177,"DAT"],[1204,1224,"ORG"],[1331,1335,"PER"],[1371,1380,"ORG"],[1412,1421,"ORG"],[1452,1466,"ORG"],[1532,1535,"ORG"],[1536,1550,"ORG"],[1580,1584,"PER"],[1601,1615,"ORG"],[1684,1691,"DAT"],[1744,1757,"PER"],[1806,1817,"ORG"],[1835,1849,"ORG"],[1876,1880,"PER"],[1947,1962,"ORG"],[2062,2073,"ORG"],[2078,2095,"ORG"],[2130,2143,"ORG"],[2204,2208,"PER"],[2281,2297,"ORG"],[2312,2322,"ORG"],[2347,2351,"PER"],[2434,2441,"LOC"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":46,"text":"Bayern Munich have told Manchester United that they want a fee of    40m ( £34.5m) plus add-ons for Benjamin Pavard, 90min understands. The 27-year-old is keen to leave the Allianz Arena this summer in search of a new challenge having lifted numerous trophies since arriving in Bavaria from Stuttgart in 2019. United, meanwhile, are keen to sign a new centre-back as they attempt to offload Harry Maguire to West Ham United in a  £30m deal, with Pavard's name high up on an extensive list of potential transfer targets. 90min previously revealed that United had open talks with Bayern over a deal for Pavard, who can play at right-back and at centre-back, and were working towards a deal that valued the World Cup winner at    35m ( £30m). But sources have confirmed to 90min that Bayern have communicated to United that they're looking for    40m plus add-ons for Pavard, much to the chagrin of the 13-time Premier League winners. Pavard is said to be unimpressed with Bayern's change in stance, with personal terms agreed in principle over a move to Old Trafford, with United also surprised by the moving of the goalposts. feed Talks are ongoing between the two parties, with United in particular keen to find a resolution, but Bayern's inability to land Kyle Walker from Manchester City means the Bundesliga giants could change their stance entirely on a potential sale.

{"id":47,"text":"Tottenham Hotspur defender Eric Dier could leave the club before the end of the summer transfer window with a number of teams considering a move for him, sources have confirmed to 90min. Dier has less than one year left to run on his Spurs contract but an agreement over an extension has not been reached and is not believed to be close. 90min were first to report back in June that Tottenham would be open to selling Dier as he was not in the immediate plans of new head coach Ange Postecoglou. The 29-year-old was left out of Spurs' matchday squad for their Premier League opening day draw at Brentford on Sunday, with Postecoglou revealing this was a tactical decision as Dier was fully fit. He was also omitted from the Greek-Australian's new-look leadership group despite playing a prevalent role under previous managers. With new vice-captain Cristian Romero, summer signing Micky van de Ven, Davinson Sanchez and Ben Davies all ahead of Dier in the pecking order, he could leave before the window closes, with Tottenham looking to trim their bloated squad ahead of the deadline on 1 September. Dier, who grew up in Portugal from the age of seven, admitted last year that he would like to play abroad again, and 90min understands he could get his wish. Former side Sporting CP would contemplate a reunion if they were to sell in-demand defender Goncalo Inacio in the next few weeks, while Lisbon rivals Benfica are also monitoring Dier in case their own highly-rated centre-back Antonio Silva leaves. However, it is likely that both clubs will keep hold of their homegrown stars for the time being. feed Ligue 1 side Monaco, who have been linked with Fulham defender and Tottenham target Tosin Adarabioyo, have asked Tottenham about the availability of Dier, as have a number of Bundesliga teams. Closer to home, London neighbours Crystal Palace and Scottish champions Celtic are believed to be admirers of Dier. There is also pressing interest in Dier from Saudi Pro League side Al Nassr, who already have the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Sadio Mane on their books. Unlike Dier's other suitors, they would be able to pay Spurs a more generous transfer fee, with European clubs looking for a cut-price deal. Dier joined Tottenham from Sporting back in 2014 and was one of their first signings under Mauricio Pochettino. He spent much of his debut season playing at right-back or centre-back before being moved into midfield under the Argentine. Since Spurs hired Jose Mourinho in 2019, Dier has almost exclusively played in his preferred centre-back role. He's played 361 games in all competitions for the Lilywhites.","label":[[0,17,"ORG"],[27,36,"PER"],[180,185,"ORG"],[187,191,"PER"],[234,239,"ORG"],[338,343,"ORG"],[373,377,"DAT"],[383,392,"ORG"],[418,422,"PER"],[478,494,"PER"],[528,533,"ORG"],[560,574,"ORG"],[595,604,"ORG"],[621,632,"PER"],[675,679,"PER"],[849,864,"PER"],[881,897,"PER"],[899,915,"PER"],[920,930,"PER"],[944,948,"PER"],[1017,1026,"ORG"],[1088,1099,"DAT"],[1101,1105,"PER"],[1122,1130,"LOC"],[1218,1223,"ORG"],[1271,1282,"ORG"],[1351,1365,"PER"],[1395,1401,"LOC"],[1409,1416,"ORG"],[1437,1441,"PER"],[1610,1617,"ORG"],[1623,1629,"ORG"],[1657,1663,"ORG"],[1677,1686,"ORG"],[1694,1710,"PER"],[1723,1732,"ORG"],[1759,1763,"PER"],[1785,1795,"ORG"],[1819,1825,"LOC"],[1837,1851,"ORG"],[1875,1881,"ORG"],[1913,1917,"PER"],[1954,1958,"PER"],[1964,1980,"ORG"],[1986,1994,"ORG"],[2026,2043,"PER"],[2048,2058,"PER"],[2082,2088,"PER"],[2130,2135,"ORG"],[2216,2220,"PER"],[2228,2237,"ORG"],[2243,2251,"ORG"],[2307,2326,"PER"],[2459,2464,"ORG"],[2471,2484,"PER"],[2488,2492,"DAT"],[2494,2498,"PER"],[2610,2624,"ORG"]],"Comments":[]}

The group own Newcastle United as well as four of the biggest Saudi clubs and they would be keen to take Neymar to any of them if the opportunity arises.","label":[[0,9,"ORG"],[18,31,"PER"],[65,71,"PER"],[99,107,"LOC"],[116,135,"ORG"],[214,226,"PER"],[238,251,"PER"],[281,284,"ORG"],[320,326,"PER"],[380,389,"ORG"],[400,412,"PER"],[456,462,"PER"],[475,479,"PER"],[591,598,"PER"],[620,626,"PER"],[825,832,"PER"],[838,843,"ORG"],[916,921,"ORG"],[1268,1275,"PER"],[1322,1328,"PER"],[1371,1380,"ORG"],[1400,1403,"ORG"],[1464,1471,"PER"],[1543,1552,"ORG"],[1585,1591,"PER"],[1593,1598,"ORG"],[1616,1619,"ORG"],[1683,1720,"ORG"],[1722,1725,"ORG"],[1742,1758,"ORG"],[1833,1839,"PER"]],"Comments":[]}
{"id":50,"text":"As the years go by, more and more money is being spent by clubs in the transfer market. Lucrative broadcasting rights, commercial deals and other premium sponsorship means clubs are richer than ever, particularly if they have happen to being playing in the Premier League. The biggest transfers seen in world football may have happened around continental Europe, sure, but the level of spending in England, and regularity of it, is at an all-time high. And with Moises Caicedo's  £115m move from Brighton to Chelsea now complete, the British transfer record has been smashed a whopping 19 times since the Premier League's inception in 1992. Here's every player and move to hold that accolade... Alan Shearer had only scored 23 goals in 118 appearances for Southampton by the time he left for Blackburn Rovers in 1992 - an average a goal just over every five games. But the soon-to-be Premier League winners, who had earned their place in the top flight via the second tier play-offs, knew exactly what they were getting with Shearer. A player who finish with both feet, bury headers for fun, and smash them in from close range and from long distance. Not even Blackburn could have imagined Shearer's time at Ewood Park to go as well as it did, mind you. He scored 112 goals for the club four seasons - one of those was severely disrupted by injury - and scored over 30 in each of his final three, including lifting the title in 1995. One of Sir Alex Ferguson's greatest pieces of work was nipping in ahead of Blackburn, who were being bankrolled by multi-millionaire Jack Walker, to sign Roy Keane for Manchester United. It was a genuine move from Ferguson as Keane spearheaded United's domination of the Premier League for the next decade -  the Irishman establishing himself at the very top of the game in terms of performance level and leadership qualities. Seven Premier League crowns and five appearances in the PFA Premier League Team of the Year tells you all you need to know. Fresh from scoring 25 goals for Norwich City in the 1993\/94 Premier League season, Chris Sutton was picked up by Blackburn for  £4m to partner Shearer up front. The transfer was an immediate success as the dynamic duo, flanked by Stuart Ripley and Jason Wilcox on the wings, scored goals for fun to steer Rovers to the title on the final day of the season. Sutton stayed at the club for further four years, bagging a career-best 18 league goals in Blackburn colours during the 1997\/98 season. If you're of a certain age, you'll know the saying 'Cole score goals'. Sir Alex Ferguson and Manchester United certainly knew it, which is why they decided to fork out  £7m to sign Cole from Newcastle United in January 1995, including send Keith Gillespie the other way. He scored 12 in 18 during his first half season in red and another 81 across the next six years. Multiple Premier League titles followed as a result, with Cole's superb lob over Ian Walker to secure the 1998\/99 crown one of his finer moments. Dennis Bergkamp arrived at Arsenal to huge fanfare in 1995 and it didn't take the Dutchman long to drag the club out of the mid-table doldrums. Under the management of Arsene Wenger, Bergkamp helped transform the Gunners into genuine title contenders, forming a deadly partnership up front with Ian Wright while linking up with the brilliant Marc Overmars on the wing. Arsenal won the Premier League title in 1997\/98, 2001\/02 and 2003\/04, with Bergkamp's contributions earning him a statue outside the Emirates Stadium. \"Collymore closing in!\" is among the most iconic lines of commentary in Premier League history. It was uttered by Martin Tyler, former voice of Sky Sports, in the final moments of the iconic 4-3 thriller between Liverpool and Newcastle in April 1996. It also had a defining impact on that season's title race, costing Newcastle in their fierce battle with Manchester United. Collymore's rise had been rapid to the say the least. He had struggled to make an impact in the top flight as a teenager with Crystal Palace, before joining Nottingham Forest in the second tier afetr a spell at Southend. He then took his prolific lower league form into the Premier League and was poached by Liverpool for a British record fee after just one season (and 22 goals). Alan Shearer's move to boyhood club Newcastle in 1996 wasn't just a British record transfer, it was a world record too - the  £15m deal surpassed the  £13.2m that Barcelona paid to PSV Eindhoven for Brazilian prodigy Ronaldo only weeks earlier that same summer. Manchester United were also very keen on Shearer too, but were famously to the deal. Most thought it was Shearer's desire to join his home town team, who had narrowly missed out on the 1995\/96 Premier League title and played some of the best football in the country under Kevin Keegan. But then Manchester United chairman has claimed in more recent years there was more to it. \"Shearer had been to Alex Ferguson's house, spoke to him and assured him he wanted to come [to Manchester],\" Edwards said on a podcast while promoting a book in 2019. \"The problem, I think, was with the chairman of Blackburn, Jack Walker, who was not a great fan of Manchester United...local rivals, both Lancashire clubs. He did not want Alan Shearer to come to Manchester United. Shearer was quite close to Walker, who was like a father figure to him, and I don't think Alan wanted to upset him by coming to United. And I'm not sure Jack would have let him come anyway, whereas he was happy for Alan to go to Newcastle, I don't think that was a threat to him.\" Shearer went on to score 206 goals in 10 years at Newcastle, breaking the club's all-time record previously held for decades by Jackie Milburn. Leeds made Rio Ferdinand the world's most expensive defender when they paid  £18m to West Ham in the final weeks of 2000. The club's overspending would later lead to their financial demise, but the good times briefly rolled with Ferdinand dressed in all-white at the back. A few months after his arrival in west Yorkshire, the centre-back scored a famous goal in a Champions League quarter-final demolition of Deportivo La Coruna. His presence also coincided with a massive upturn in their domestic form, losing just two Premier League games in the second half of 2000\/01 after a poor start to the campain. Manchester United had initially agreed to sign Ruud van Nistelrooy in 2000, only for the transfer to fall through over concerns about fitness. The Dutch stiker then suffered a dreaded ACL injury during a PSV Eindhoven training session, but United were still prepared to shell out a record fee in 2001. His goalscoring was immediate, netting twice on his Premier League debut and scoring 36 in all competitions on his first season, upping that number to 44 in his second. Van Nistelrooy finished his United career in 2006 with 150 goals in 219 games, an average of 30 per season, but is arguably an underrated part of the club's modern history because of what the likes of Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo went on to achieve in the years that immediately followed. \"I used to get excited when the club would sign a big player because that   s the nature of the game. Veron came to the club, he was an excellent player, okay it didn   t work out for him at United, but he was an excellent player,\" Roy Keane said in 2020, looking back on Juan Sebastian's two seasons at Manchester United. Veron signed for United having developed a lofty reputation thanks to his exploits in Serie A with Parma and Lazio. There was initial promise, that's for sure, and the Argentine particularly enjoyed the European nights, but struggled to cope with the physical demands of an entire Premier League season without a fixed role in the team. Injuries compromised his second season at Old Trafford after a promising start to the campaign, and United opted to cut their losses and sell to Chelsea in 2003. Undeterred by Veron's struggles, United broke the British record again the following summer, although Ferdinand's familiarity with the English game perhaps rendered his  £29.3m arrival from Leeds substantially less of a risk.  Sir Alex Ferguson never doubted Rio's capacity to become one of the world's best in his position - his displays for England at the 2022 World Cup did that opinion no harm - and he rapidly developed into a stalwart of United's defence. Frighteningly quick and unerringly cool in possession, Ferdinand was the ultimate modern-day centre-back. He enjoyed a stellar 12-year career at Old Trafford, lifting six Premier League trophies and the Champions League in 2008. He's recognised as one of England's greatest defenders and a modern Manchester United legend.  It took a little while for Ferdinand's record to go, but smashed it was in the summer of 2006 as Chelsea prised former Ballon d'Or winner Andriy Shevchenko away from AC Milan.  The former Dynamo Kyiv hotshot emerged as one of the world's most potent forwards during his time in Lombardy. Shevchenko departed Milan as their second leading scorer of all-time and with a Champions League medal in his back pocket, and the Ballon d'Or on his mantelpiece. However, the Ukrainian striker struggled to adjust to life in west London. His two years at Chelsea were rather forgettable. He scored here and there, and only rarely did he put together a sustained run of form. The striker's apex was in the rearview mirror, that's for sure, and he returned to Milan on loan for the 2008\/09 season before eventually settling back in Kyiv. This signing ignited the revolution that culminated in Manchester City blossoming into the Premier League's supreme force. On the same day City were bought out by the Abu Dhabi United Group, they quickly went to work and signed Brazilian star Robinho from Real Madrid for a British record  £32.5m. City had been haggling Reggina and Portsmouth for the additions of Rolando Bianchi and Benjani respectively in the preceding months, now they were negotiating with Europe's elite. Money talks. Supposedly persuaded by City's Brazilian contingent that included former Santos teammate Elano, Robinho signed up for the project in Manchester and made an immediate difference. His first season at the club was superb as he ended the 2008\/09 as the Premier League's fourth-highest goalscorer with 14. However, things quickly turned sour for the maverick attacker as injuries reduced his significance dramatically in year two. Discontent and perhaps fed up of listening to Mark Hughes, Robinho returned to Santos on loan in January 2010 and was never seen again in Manchester. Panic or sheer recruiting incompetence? Either way, Torres was never going to live up to his  £50m price tag at Stamford Bridge.  The Spaniard was no longer the phenom that took the Premier League by storm at Liverpool, with injuries reducing his explosiveness and rendering him a nondescript threat. Torres was forced to evolve and while the striker that rocked up at Chelsea was a shell of his peak-self, he remained somewhat useful. He was never prolific for the Blues during his three-and-a-half years at the club, but he did score one of the most memorable goals in Chelsea's history away at Barcelona in the 2011\/12 Champions League semi-finals. For that, many supporters overlooked his mammoth price tag. The ultimate maverick. A youthful but ambitious Pogba departed Manchester United for greater first-team opportunities overseas in 2012 and ended up at Juventus.  The Frenchman dazzled during his four years in Turin, swiftly evolving into the personification of a highlight reel and a bona fide superstar. Given his prestige, it was going to cost an arm and a leg for United to bring the midfielder 'home'. But they did exactly that in 2016, handing Juve  £89m for his services. Now, summarising Pogba's second stint at United is rather tricky. While the conclusion was somewhat sombre, the Frenchman did enjoy some scintillating runs of form at Old Trafford. However, it's fair to say he couldn't quite justify United's massive outlay to bring him back, especially given that he eventually left for nothing (again) when he re-signed for Juve in 2022. Considering their riches, it's pretty remarkable that City only appear on this list twice. Nevertheless, they made Grealish the first-ever Englishman to garner a  £100m fee in 2021.  The marvellous Brummie playmaker had put Aston Villa on his back during the 2019\/20 season to keep the Villans in the Premier League, and a move away became increasingly inevitable after a fine 2020\/21 campaign. City bit the bullet and acquired Grealish for a record fee after triggering his release clause, but it took the wide man a little while to find his feet at the Etihad. Adjusting to Pep Guardiola's demands is never easy, and Grealish struggled to flourish in his debut season. But he excelled in year two and played an underrated role in City's historic treble triumph. Overpriced, they said. Haha.  Convinced by his talent after an excellent 2022 World Cup with winners Argentina, Chelsea made a big splash in the January transfer window and signed Fernandez for a whopping  £106.8m. Despite his stellar form in Qatar during the winter, eyebrows were ubiquitously raised given the midfielder's relative inexperience of European football.  He'd arrived at Benfica just six months prior.  Nevertheless, Fernandez stuck out for all the right reasons during his first few months in west London. He tried his utmost to ensure Chelsea looked competent, but not even he could salvage the Blues.  A controller, playmaker and potentially a final third producer all wrapped into one elegant midfield operator, Fernandez is set to take the Premier League by storm under Mauricio Pochettino at Stamford Bridge. Finding a suitable midfield partner for Fernandez was one of Chelsea's key objectives in the 2023 summer transfer window, and they finally got their man.  Sure, it might've taken yet another British record fee to acquire their desired midfield target, but Moises Caicedo's potential alongside Fernandez renders the outlay somewhat measured given the tandem's projected dynamic.","label":[[257,271,"ORG"],[355,361,"LOC"],[398,405,"LOC"],[462,478,"PER"],[480,485,"MON"],[496,504,"ORG"],[508,515,"ORG"],[605,621,"ORG"],[635,639,"DAT"],[695,707,"PER"],[756,767,"ORG"],[792,808,"ORG"],[812,816,"DAT"],[884,898,"ORG"],[1025,1032,"PER"],[1160,1169,"ORG"],[1190,1199,"PER"],[1208,1218,"LOC"],[1428,1432,"DAT"],[1441,1460,"PER"],[1509,1518,"ORG"],[1567,1578,"PER"],[1588,1597,"PER"],[1602,1619,"ORG"],[1648,1656,"PER"],[1660,1665,"PER"],[1678,1686,"ORG"],[1705,1719,"ORG"],[1867,1881,"ORG"],[1917,1920,"ORG"],[1921,1935,"ORG"],[2017,2029,"ORG"],[2037,2044,"DAT"],[2045,2059,"ORG"],[2068,2080,"PER"],[2098,2107,"ORG"],[2113,2116,"MON"],[2128,2135,"PER"],[2215,2228,"PER"],[2233,2245,"PER"],[2290,2296,"ORG"],[2342,2348,"PER"],[2433,2442,"ORG"],[2462,2469,"DAT"],[2530,2534,"PER"],[2549,2566,"PER"],[2571,2588,"ORG"],[2647,2650,"MON"],[2659,2663,"PER"],[2669,2685,"ORG"],[2689,2701,"DAT"],[2718,2733,"ORG"],[2855,2869,"ORG"],[2904,2910,"PER"],[2927,2937,"PER"],[2952,2959,"DAT"],[2992,3007,"PER"],[3019,3026,"ORG"],[3046,3050,"DAT"],[3160,3173,"PER"],[3175,3183,"PER"],[3201,3212,"ORG"],[3287,3297,"PER"],[3334,3347,"PER"],[3361,3368,"ORG"],[3377,3391,"ORG"],[3401,3408,"DAT"],[3410,3417,"DAT"],[3422,3429,"DAT"],[3436,3446,"PER"],[3494,3510,"LOC"],[3513,3522,"PER"],[3584,3598,"ORG"],[3626,3638,"PER"],[3656,3666,"ORG"],[3724,3733,"ORG"],[3738,3747,"ORG"],[3751,3761,"DAT"],[3830,3839,"ORG"],[3868,3885,"ORG"],[3887,3898,"PER"],[4013,4027,"ORG"],[4044,4061,"ORG"],[4098,4106,"LOC"],[4161,4175,"ORG"],[4195,4204,"ORG"],[4268,4282,"PER"],[4304,4313,"ORG"],[4317,4321,"DAT"],[4394,4398,"MON"],[4419,4425,"MON"],[4431,4440,"ORG"],[4449,4462,"ORG"],[4485,4492,"PER"],[4530,4547,"ORG"],[4571,4578,"PER"],[4635,4644,"PER"],[4715,4722,"DAT"],[4723,4737,"ORG"],[4802,4814,"PER"],[4825,4842,"ORG"],[4908,4915,"PER"],[4928,4943,"PER"],[5002,5012,"LOC"],[5016,5023,"PER"],[5068,5072,"DAT"],[5122,5131,"ORG"],[5133,5144,"PER"],[5173,5190,"ORG"],[5212,5222,"LOC"],[5246,5258,"PER"],[5270,5287,"ORG"],[5289,5296,"PER"],[5316,5322,"PER"],[5379,5383,"PER"],[5417,5423,"ORG"],[5442,5446,"PER"],[5504,5508,"PER"],[5518,5527,"ORG"],[5570,5577,"PER"],[5620,5629,"ORG"],[5698,5712,"PER"],[5714,5719,"ORG"],[5725,5738,"PER"],[5791,5795,"MON"],[5799,5807,"ORG"],[5830,5834,"DAT"],[5943,5952,"PER"],[6021,6035,"LOC"],[6079,6095,"ORG"],[6124,6143,"ORG"],[6235,6249,"ORG"],[6278,6285,"DAT"],[6321,6338,"ORG"],[6368,6387,"PER"],[6391,6395,"DAT"],[6525,6538,"ORG"],[6561,6567,"ORG"],[6617,6621,"DAT"],[6675,6689,"ORG"],[6792,6806,"PER"],[6820,6826,"ORG"],[6837,6841,"DAT"],[6993,7005,"PER"],[7010,7027,"PER"],[7189,7194,"PER"],[7278,7284,"ORG"],[7319,7328,"PER"],[7337,7341,"DAT"],[7359,7375,"PER"],[7391,7408,"ORG"],[7410,7415,"PER"],[7427,7433,"ORG"],[7496,7503,"ORG"],[7509,7514,"ORG"],[7519,7524,"ORG"],[7691,7705,"ORG"],[7789,7801,"LOC"],[7847,7853,"ORG"],[7892,7899,"ORG"],[7903,7907,"DAT"],[7923,7930,"PER"],[7942,7948,"ORG"],[8011,8022,"PER"],[8079,8085,"MON"],[8099,8104,"ORG"],[8136,8153,"PER"],[8168,8173,"PER"],[8252,8259,"ORG"],[8267,8271,"DAT"],[8272,8281,"ORG"],[8353,8361,"ORG"],[8426,8435,"PER"],[8516,8528,"LOC"],[8542,8556,"ORG"],[8574,8590,"ORG"],[8594,8598,"DAT"],[8626,8635,"ORG"],[8668,8685,"ORG"],[8722,8733,"PER"],[8784,8788,"DAT"],[8792,8799,"ORG"],[8833,8850,"PER"],[8861,8869,"ORG"],[8883,8894,"ORG"],[8973,8981,"LOC"],[8983,8993,"PER"],[9003,9008,"ORG"],[9063,9079,"ORG"],[9208,9219,"LOC"],[9238,9245,"ORG"],[9441,9446,"ORG"],[9463,9470,"DAT"],[9513,9517,"LOC"],[9574,9589,"ORG"],[9610,9626,"ORG"],[9658,9662,"ORG"],[9686,9708,"ORG"],[9762,9769,"PER"],[9775,9786,"ORG"],[9809,9815,"MON"],[9817,9821,"ORG"],[9840,9847,"ORG"],[9852,9862,"ORG"],[9884,9899,"PER"],[9904,9911,"PER"],[9981,9989,"LOC"],[10034,10040,"ORG"],[10083,10089,"ORG"],[10099,10104,"PER"],[10106,10113,"PER"],[10143,10153,"ORG"],[10244,10251,"DAT"],[10259,10275,"ORG"],[10482,10493,"PER"],[10495,10502,"PER"],[10515,10521,"ORG"],[10533,10545,"DAT"],[10574,10584,"ORG"],[10638,10644,"PER"],[10680,10684,"MON"],[10698,10713,"LOC"],[10768,10782,"ORG"],[10795,10804,"ORG"],[10887,10893,"PER"],[10955,10962,"ORG"],[11048,11057,"ORG"],[11157,11166,"ORG"],[11183,11192,"ORG"],[11200,11207,"DAT"],[11208,11224,"ORG"],[11346,11351,"PER"],[11361,11378,"ORG"],[11428,11432,"DAT"],[11449,11457,"ORG"],[11507,11512,"LOC"],[11665,11671,"ORG"],[11733,11737,"DAT"],[11747,11751,"ORG"],[11753,11757,"MON"],[11793,11800,"PER"],[11817,11823,"ORG"],[11943,11955,"LOC"],[12009,12017,"ORG"],[12135,12139,"ORG"],[12143,12147,"DAT"],[12203,12207,"ORG"],[12264,12272,"PER"],[12312,12317,"MON"],[12325,12329,"DAT"],[12347,12354,"LOC"],[12373,12384,"ORG"],[12408,12415,"DAT"],[12431,12442,"ORG"],[12450,12464,"ORG"],[12526,12533,"DAT"],[12544,12548,"ORG"],[12577,12585,"PER"],[12704,12710,"LOC"],[12725,12740,"PER"],[12768,12776,"PER"],[12881,12887,"ORG"],[12986,12990,"DAT"],[12991,13000,"ORG"],[13014,13023,"ORG"],[13025,13032,"ORG"],[13058,13065,"DAT"],[13093,13102,"PER"],[13119,13126,"MON"],[13156,13161,"LOC"],[13299,13306,"ORG"],[13
