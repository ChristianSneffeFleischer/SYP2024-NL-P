# text = A year is an awful long time in football , and that has certainly proved the case for Folarin Balogun . This time last year , few would have known too much about the young Arsenal striker , but following an impressive loan spell with Stade Reims in Ligue 1 , the 22 - year - old is now one of the most exciting young forwards in Europe and a USMNT international . Scoring 22 goals in 39 games for Reims last season , he is now being targeted by a number of top clubs . However , 90min understands that Arsenal value Balogun at £ 50m , which may put off some potential suitors . The Gunners have told Balogun he can find a new club with no obvious route into the first team as Gabriel Jesus , Eddie Nketiah and new signing Kai Havertz stand in his path . There will be many clubs knocking on his agent ' s door this summer , but where he will end up is still unclear . feed Having come within 90 minutes of Champions League glory last season , things promise to be more complicated for Inter this term . Andre Onana , Marcelo Brozovic , Edin Dzeko and Romelu Lukaku will not be at the club next season as Simone Inzaghi is responsible for something of a rebuild in key areas this summer . One position that needs strengthening in the window is up front . Having brought in Marcus Thuram on a free transfer to help Lautaro Martinez , Inzaghi is keen to reinforce his attacking unit further having lost two key centre - forward options . Balogun is one of the players Inter have been in contact with over a potential move to San Siro . More similar in profile to Martinez than Thuram , Balogun could offer depth and quality in attack . The forward has huge potential and could develop further in Serie A under Inzaghi ' s tutelage , but that £ 50m fee would likely be unworkable for Inter . Considering West Ham are the only Premier League club yet to make a signing this window , David Moyes would probably be thankful to get anybody through the door at the London Stadium . The £ 105m departure of Declan Rice means the Hammers have a huge budget to work with , but they have still been unable to get any deals done . Atalanta , who are a club linked with Balogun themselves , have agreed a deal for Irons forward Gianluca Scamacca after an unsuccessful stint with West Ham . Not only will this add another £ 26m to available funds , it will free up a space up front that needs filling . Balogun could be the man to fill the gap , posing a completely different skillset to the departing Scamacca . Balogun ' s pace and nous for finding space in the penalty area could make him a prime target to add more goals to a sometimes blunt West Ham side . A return to Ligue 1 could be on the cards for Balogun , who would certainly need no time in readjusting to life in France . Lille finished fifth last season and qualified for the Europa Conference League , but would likely find it difficult to raise the required funds to prise Balogun away from north London . Paulo Fonseca ' s side have lost a couple of forward players in Timothy Weah and Jonathan Bamba this summer and need greater depth in attacking areas . Balogun , however , may be too far out of their price range . Jordan Ayew , Odsonne Edouard and Jean - Philippe Mateta are hardly the most awe - inspiring attacking trio in the Premier League . The three strikers have all struggled for consistency since arriving at Selhurst Park , and with Wilfried Zaha ' s exit , Palace need more goals next year . Michael Olise ' s potential departure would only exacerbate this issue , but Balogun could be the solution . The 22 - year - old ' s ability to run in behind opposition defences makes him a completely different proposition to the Eagles ' current centre - forward options . Similarly to Lille , however , Palace would be unlikely to splash £ 50m on untested Premier League player , knowing a better could be found deal somewhere else in Europe . Ivan Toney scored 20 goals in 33 Premier League games last season but will not be available to Brentford until January 2024 following a ban for breaching betting rules . While Bryan Mbuemo , Kevin Schade , and Yoane Wissa are all capable of providing goals for the Bees next year , they won ' t be able to offer the same consistency as Toney . Balogun showcased his ability to score weekly for Reims last season , although doing it in the Premier League is admittedly a different proposition . Balogun is also a different profile striker to Toney and is not quite as adept at holding the ball up and winning physical battles . Given Brentford just spent around £ 20m on Schade following his move from Freiburg , they may not be in a position to spend big on Balogun . Arsenal do not expect midfielder Jorginho to leave before the end of the summer transfer window despite rumoured interest from Fenerbahce . The Gunners recruited the Italy international back in January and he has since courted maintained interest from Serie A sides Lazio and Juventus . While a good offer would be enough for Arsenal to sell Jorginho - much like teammate Thomas Partey ' s current situation - 90min understands he isn ' t in talks with Turkish side Fenerbahce and an exit is not currently on the cards . Arsenal are preparing to let goalkeeper Matt Turner depart after agreeing an £ 8m deal with Nottingham Forest for the USMNT international . Turner joined Arsenal in 2022 as back - up to Aaron Ramsdale and featured at the 2022 World Cup with the United States . Forest used Dean Henderson and Keylor Navas as goalies last season . Steve Cooper ' s side still like Manchester United ' s Henderson , but their preference for a loan deal due to his injury record differs to United favouring a permanent move . Roma defender Roger Ibanez was also a target for Forest , with talks over a 30m deal being held , but he has instead elected to join Saudi Pro League side Al Ahli . Napoli midfielder Piotr Zielinski is another player who will soon seal a move to the Middle East . Poland international Zielinski , who was a key figure in his side ' s historic Serie A title win last season , will soon confirm his move to Al Ahli , where Roberto Firmino , Allan Saint - Maximin and Edouard Mendy have all relocated this summer . Napoli are targeting Teun Koopmeiners and Gabri Veiga as potential replacements . Atalanta aren ' t looking to sell Koopmeiners for any less than 50m , while a 30m offer for Veiga was rejected by Celta Vigo . Paris Saint - Germain have agreed personal terms with Eintracht Frankfurt striker Randal Kolo Muani and a deal is close to completion . PSG see Kolo Muani as their ideal replacement for Kylian Mbappe and talks accelerated over the weekend . Youngster Hugo Ekitike was offered during negotiations , a player Frankfurt are appreciative of . The Ligue 1 champions are still tracking Joao Felix ' s situation , though favour a loan deal which they could pursue towards the end of the month . The Portugal forward also has an offer from Al Ahli but wants to stay in Europe . feed Burnley are ready to seize on Sheffield United ' s instability by pursuing a deal for Norwegian midfielder Sander Berge . The Blades have already lost Iliman Ndiaye this month and are ready to sell their other star midfielder to the Clarets . Berge only has a year left on his contract and has turned down fresh advances from United . Should a deal be agreed , Berge will still need to come through a medical , having seen a switch to Fulham in January fall through because of a knock . Burnley are also keen to wrap up a deal for Ajax striker Mohamed Daramy but face competition from Reims , who have entered the bidding late on in their search for a replacement for Folarin Balogun . Crystal Palace are in talks with Bayer Leverkusen over a loan move for centre - back Odilon Kossounou . Palace are looking to add to their options in central defence where Marc Guehi and Joachim Andersen have impressed and a deal with a 25m obligation to buy has been put forward . Leverkusen have also been in contact with Tottenham all summer over the future of fellow defender Edmond Tapsoba . Chelsea have contacted the representatives of USA midfielder Tyler Adams over a possible move to Stamford Bridge , 90min understands . Adams played for the USMNT at the 2022 World Cup and was relegated with Leeds in his first season in the Premier League having joined from RB Leipzig for £ 15m . Adams suffered a hamstring injury in March and didn ' t add to his 24 league appearances thereafter . Leeds accepted they would likely lose Adams and international teammate Brenden Aaronson following their relegation to the Championship . Aaronson has since joined Union Berlin on loan , while Adams previously attracted interest from Newcastle . Sources have confirmed to 90min that Chelsea have now enquired over his availability . Adams has a release worth around £ 25m and the Blues believe the midfielder would slot in well in west London . Leeds expect the 24 - year - old to leave Elland Road by the end of the month , with Chelsea not the only Premier League side interested . Tottenham , Liverpool , Manchester United , Brighton and Brentford are all keeping tabs on the situation . feed Adams was in attendance for Leeds ' opening Championship game of the season against Cardiff on Sunday as his side rescued a 2 - 2 draw thanks to goals from Liam Cooper and Crysencio Summerville . Chelsea have signed exciting talent like Nicolas Jackson and Christopher Nkunku so far this window but are light in midfield after the departures of Mason Mount , N ' Golo Kante and Ruben Loftus - Cheek . Rennes star Lesley Ugochukwu has recently joined the options at Mauricio Pochettino ' s disposal which include Enzo Fernandez , Conor Gallagher and Andrey Santos . Moises Caicedo is a high - profile target for Pochettino and Todd Boehly but no agreement with Brighton has been reached . The Ecuador international has a price tag of £ 100m and missed the Seagulls ' final pre - season friendly of the summer against Rayo Vallecano on Sunday . Serie A giants AC Milan have confirmed the signing of US men ' s national team midfielder Yunus Musah from Valencia . The 2021 / 22 Scudetto winners have splashed the cash this summer after Sandro Tonali joined Newcastle , with Musah now the second USMNT player to join the historic Italian side after star forward Christian Pulisic made the move from Chelsea to Milan earlier this summer . The 20 - year - old leaves La Liga side Valencia after making 108 appearances and scoring five goals in all competitions . Before joining Valencia in 2019 , Musah was part of Arsenal ' s U18 squad from October 2017 to August 2019 . At the international level , Musah represented England at the U17 and U18 level before switching his allegiance to the US in 2020 . He ' s 27 appearances for the USMNT since 2020 and was key to the Stars and Stripes ' Nations League triumphs in 2019 / 20 and 2022 / 23 . " AC Milan is pleased to announce the signing of Yunus Musah on a permanent basis . The midfielder has signed a contract with the Club until 30 June 2028 , " an AC Milan club statement read . The ink is dry , and the future is bright ! # ACMQuest # SempreMilan pic . twitter . com / k8Tl84wUWH West Ham United have agreed to sell Gianluca Scamacca to Atalanta in a deal worth 30m ( £ 26m ) , sources have confirmed to 90min . The 24 - year - old was one of the Hammers ' marquee signings last summer , alongside Lucas Paqueta , but it was quickly apparent that a change in playing style would be needed to get the best out of the Italian . Injury complaints didn ' t help Scamacca in trying to settle in London , and he was unable to command a regular starting spot despite costing David Moyes and West Ham in excess of £ 30m when joining from Sassuolo . Scamacca scored eight goals in all competitions from 27 appearances , but crucially netted just three times in the Premier League for West Ham , who laboured to 20 defeats from their 38 league games but did end their 43 - year trophy drought by winning the Conference League . 90min revealed in early June that Roma had shown an interest in taking Scamacca back to Serie A , with the player showing a desire to return to his homeland . Jose Mourinho ' s side were unable to fund a permanent deal , however , and were instead looking to conclude a loan with option or obligation to buy . Inter also made a bid for Scamacca but sources have confirmed to 90min it ' s Atalanta who have agreed a deal with West Ham . feed Last season ' s Europa League quarter - finalists will pay a guaranteed 25m ( £ 21 . 6m ) for Scamacca , with a further 5m in achievable add - ons included into the deal , and are set to partner him up with AC Milan ' s Charles De Ketelaere , who is nearing a loan move with option to buy . 90min understands that Scamacca is already en route to complete a medical , ending his stay in east London after just a year of the five he committed to little over 12 months ago . Scamacca ' s exit is another blow to a West Ham side who are yet to make a senior signing this summer - they are the only Premier League club who haven ' t - amid disagreements between Moyes and new technical director Tim Steidten over how to replace Declan Rice , who joined Arsenal earlier this summer in a British - record £ 105m deal . West Ham are also yet to appoint a new club captain , even though the new Premier League season gets underway in six days when newly - promoted Burnley take on Manchester City . Manchester City have confirmed the signing of centre - back Josko Gvardiol from RB Leipzig . 90min understands that City have agreed to pay an initial £ 77 . 5m to land Gvardiol , who Pep Guardiola confirmed was in Manchester over the weekend to undergo a medical . A five - year contract has been signed by Gvardiol , who becomes City ' s second arrival of the summer after fellow Croatian Mateo Kovacic ' s move from Chelsea . " I have always dreamed of one day playing in England and to be doing so now with Manchester City after the season they have just had is a real honour for me , " Gvardiol said . " Anyone who saw Manchester City play last season knows they are the best team in the world . To win the Treble says everything you need to know about the quality this team has . " To be joining City is something very special for me and my family . To have the chance to work with Pep Guardiola , too , will be amazing . I know I am not yet the finished article and I am sure my game will progress under the best coach in football . " To be linking up with Mateo Kovacic will also be special . He s a top footballer and I hope we can both help City achieve another successful season in 2023 / 24 and then beyond . " feed Director of football Txiki Begiristain added : " We are very happy to bring Josko to Manchester City . He is a player we have watched closely , and we feel he has a superb set of attributes . " Top clubs all over Europe have been monitoring him , so to bring him here is great news for us . " Josko has so many qualities everything you want in a centre - half . He is fast , competitive , combative , strong in the air , impressive in possession of the ball , with strong self - belief and a good character . He is left - footed , too , which offers us good options at the back . " He is still young but his progress in the game has been rapid . We feel confident his upward trajectory will continue here at City working with Pep and his staff . " Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has confirmed that RB Leipzig centre - back Josko Gvardiol is undergoing a medical ahead of a proposed move to the Etihad Stadium . City have struck a deal worth an initial £ 77 . 5m to sign Gvardiol , with add - ons which could see the transfer become the most expensive ever to involve a centre - back . Guardiola has now confirmed that Gvardiol , who ' s childhood nickname was Guardiola due to the obvious similarities between the two names , is in Manchester to put the finishing touches on his move . " Gvardiol , what a beautiful surname he has ! " Guardiola joked during a press conference . " He is doing a medical test . Everybody knows he is here . Hopefully , we can finish the deal in the next few hours or days . " feed Should all go according to plan , Gvardiol would become the sixth centre - back in the City squad alongside Ruben Dias , John Stones , Manuel Akanji , Nathan Ake , Aymeric Laporte , while Kyle Walker often inverts from right - back as well . " The season is so long . [ Six ] is not too much ] , " Guardiola said of his defensive group . Walker is facing an uncertain future at City as Bayern Munich try to lure the England international away , but Guardiola is prepared for a fight to keep him . He said : " [ Walker ] is so important to us . We want [ him ] and will do everything . We want him to stay because he wants to stay . We will do everything . " Chelsea have made an offer for 18 - year - old Santos striker Deivid Washington , 90min understands . The Blues have not been afraid to splash the cash in the second summer under BlueCo , whose acquisition of Ligue 1 side Strasbourg has seen them step up their pursuits of a number of young talents who could hone their craft in France . There are hopes to use Strasbourg to finally get a deal for Russian starlet Arsen Zakharyan over the line , while Montpellier striker Elye Wahi could be loaned to the French side if a deal can be struck with his current employers . A decision must be made on new midfielder recruit Lesley Ugochukwu and Brazilian winger Angelo , who joined from Santos earlier this summer , has also been tipped for a move to Strasbourg . Sources have confirmed to 90min that Chelsea have once again returned to Santos with an offer for 18 - year - old Washington . feed A bid of an initial £ 13m , plus a further £ 4m in add - ons , has been lodged by the Blues , who are trying to negotiate a discount on Santos ' £ 26m asking price . Clubs across Europe have been following Washington , with Monaco ready to match Chelsea ' s £ 15m bid if it is accepted , but the Stamford Bridge outfit are working to win the race for his signature and could loan the teenager to Strasbourg if a deal is struck . Ligue 1 rules mean Chelsea can loan just three players out to Strasbourg , who must also adhere to the rule of having no more than four non - EU players on their books , so alternative strategies will have to be taken for some of these proposed loans . Washington has managed 16 senior appearances for Santos and has scored two goals , both of which came in consecutive outings in May . Bayern Munich have made a club - record 100m bid for Tottenham striker Harry Kane , 90min understands . England captain Kane has been Bayern ' s top transfer target all summer and the two clubs recently met for talks in London . The Bundesliga giants left with optimism that a deal this summer could be struck . Bayern previously had two offers rejected , the second of which amounted to 80m ( £ 68 . 5m ) , and 90min can confirm their third offer totals 100m ( £ 86m ) . Spurs have been hesitant to sell but there has been pressure on chairman Daniel Levy within the club ' s hierarchy to consider selling Kane to avoid losing him for free next summer . Thomas Tuchel ' s side are unlikely to return with a higher bid if Tottenham are left unsatisfied with the third offer . Bayern do , however , want a decision over the sale to be made quickly by Spurs . Tottenham have been confident throughout the summer of keeping the 30 - year - old even though his deal expires next year . The north London side remain hopeful Kane will sign a new contract and plan to work on fresh terms during Ange Postecoglou ' s first season in charge . feed Spurs informed Kane at the start of the transfer window they had no plans to sell him , with Manchester United , Real Madrid and Paris Saint - Germain among the European heavyweights eyeing a move . The start of the new Premier League season is only a week away and Spurs have brought in James Maddison , Guglielmo Vicario and Manor Solomon , also making the loans for Dejan Kulusevski and Pedro Porro permanent . Progress has been made in the pursuit of centre - back Micky van de Ven , while Spurs have also agreed to meet the release clause of Rosario Central striker Alejo Veliz . Tottenham Hotspur have confirmed the signing of Alejo Veliz from Rosario Central , subject to international clearance and a work permit . The 19 - year - old has put pen to paper on a contract until 2029 and becomes Spurs ' seventh permanent addition of a busy summer transfer window . The club announced the arrival of Micky van de Ven from Wolfsburg earlier on Tuesday . " It ' s like I ' m touching the heavens , " Veliz said during his announcement video . feed Veliz will take the number 36 shirt and joins Tottenham for a £ 13m fee . 90min reported last week that Spurs were going to win the race for the highly - rated striker , with AC Milan , AS Roma , Nottingham Forest , and Salernitana also interested in his signature . While Veliz arrives to bolster Spurs ' attacking options , his arrival is unlikely to have much bearing on the future of Harry Kane . 90min understands that Kane will stay put in north London for the 2023 / 24 season if a move away does not transpire before the new Premier League campaign begins this weekend . Bayern Munich have had three Kane bids rejected by Tottenham and are contemplating making a fourth , while the German champions are also beginning to look at alternate options . Liverpool have had a third offer for Romeo Lavia worth £ 45m rejected by Southampton , sources have confirmed to 90min . The 19 - year - old has been attracting the interest of Chelsea and Arsenal for the best part of a year , but Liverpool have shot to the front of the queue of interested parties after allowing central midfield duo Jordan Henderson and Fabinho to head to the riches of Saudi Arabia . The Reds saw an opening offer of £ 35m immediately rejected by recently - relegated Southampton , before an improved bid for Lavia worth £ 42m was also rebuffed . Southampton have maintained throughout negotiations that they want at least £ 50m for Lavia , and 90min understands they have held their ground after receiving a third Liverpool offer , worth £ 45m in total . Liverpool remain keen to tie up a deal for Lavia and crucially have not walked away from negotiations - indicating that they may be willing to raise their offer once more in order to get a deal over the line . feed Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai have already arrived at Anfield this summer , from Brighton and RB Leipzig respectively , but there ' s an appetite for Liverpool to conclude further business in a bid to get back into the Premier League title mix . Jurgen Klopp has seen not only Henderson and Fabinho depart , but also Naby Keita , Alex Oxlade - Chamberlain and James Milner from the midfield ranks - Lavia ' s potential arrival an indication of a changing of the guard on Merseyside . Fluminense ' s Andre Trindade is regarded as a viable alternative to Lavia , should Liverpool not be able to iron things out with Southampton , while the club may also look to sign a centre - back before the summer window slams shut . Chelsea are expected to agree to the loan departures of both Lewis Hall and Cesare Casadei , 90min understands , with talks underway over both players ' next moves . Hall , 18 , made his breakthrough into the senior side last season , seeing a number of appearances at left - back under Frank Lampard despite most of his academy training coming as a central midfielder . Chelsea have plenty of competition for minutes at left - back , with Ian Maatsen ' s sensational loan with Burnley seeing him kept in a squad which already includes both Ben Chilwell and Marc Cucurella , and now 90min understands a loan move is on the cards for Hall . Talks are on with Crystal Palace , who are looking to sign Hall on a loan deal which would not include a purchase clause . Chelsea are huge believers in Hall , who has three years remaining on his contract , and want to see the teenager back at Stamford Bridge next summer . The negotiations over Hall are being kept separate from those involving Palace ' s Michael Olise , for whom Chelsea are confident of getting a deal over the line . feed Hall is expected to be followed out of the door by 20 - year - old Casadei who , after six months on loan with Reading last season , is set to get his next taste of senior football with Leicester City . Chelsea had hoped to find a top - flight suitor for Casadei , whose meteoric rise to prominence continued with a stunning Under - 20 World Cup campaign this summer , but believe the chance to work under new Foxes boss Enzo Maresca towards the top of the Championship could be beneficial for the Italian . Both players were given a handful of opportunities under new manager Mauricio Pochettino during pre - season but the Blues ' bloated squad means there is significant competition for minutes and so the decisions have been taken to look for loan moves . Chelsea will also decide on the futures of fellow young midfielders Andrey Santos and Carney Chukwuemeka , both of whom saw plenty of minutes in pre - season . Real Madrid stars Vinicius Junior and Eder Militao have added fuel to the fire surrounding Kylian Mbappe ' s future with a message to Madrid chief scout Juni Calafat . Mbappe has been made available for transfer this summer after declining to trigger the extension in his current Paris Saint - Germain contract , which now expires next summer . Real Madrid are long - term admirers of Mbappe and are planning to secure the Frenchman ' s signature either this summer or next year on a free transfer , while PSG have attempted to drum up interest from elsewhere to ensure they do not lost their talisman for nothing . A world record bid from Al Hilal was accepted by the club but rejected by Mbappe himself , while Premier League sides like Chelsea have been contacted but are not confident of convincing the Frenchman , whose focus remains on Madrid . While an official offer from Madrid is yet to arrive , a number of players have taken the opportunity to fuel the speculation , with winger Rodrygo posting a picture alongside Mbappe last week with no caption . feed Now , Vinicius and Militao have continued to tease fans after a video emerged ( via GOAL ) with the duo telling chief scout Calafat : " We hope [ Mbappe ] will come . Juni has to sign him . " Calafat responded to the duo , joking : " You are spending all our money in Ibiza . We ll no longer have enough for Mbappe . " PSG have returned to France to finalise their preparations for the upcoming Ligue 1 season and face a decision over what to do with Mbappe , who has been training with a group of transfer - listed players and has not yet worked under new manager Luis Enrique . The Parisians will get their season underway on Saturday when they welcome Lorient to Parc des Princes . Edson Alvarez is undergoing a medical at West Ham United ahead of joining from Ajax on a five - year contract . Sources have confirmed to 90min that an agreement has been reached in principle over a deal worth £ 34m , with the Mexico international one of West Ham ' s top targets to replace Declan Rice . The Hammers have endured a frustrating transfer window so far , amid clashes between manager David Moyes and technical director Tim Steidten over targets , and have seen bids for Joao Palhinha , Conor Gallagher and James Ward - Prowse turned down . Manchester United ' s Scott McTominay has also been on the radar , but Alvarez , alongside Monaco ' s Youssouf Fofana , is a player that Steidten has been pushing for West Ham to sign . 90min revealed on Sunday that talks were ongoing with Dutch giants Ajax over a fee for Alvarez , who has long indicated his desire to move to the Premier League , and sources have now confirmed that an agreement has been reached over a deal that could eventually be worth £ 34m . Alvarez was close to joining Borussia Dortmund earlier this summer but a deal to move to the Bundesliga runners - up fell through at the 11th hour . feed 26 - year - old Alvarez has also been on the radar of Manchester United and Chelsea over the past 12 months , though both clubs have moved on to secure other targets and their interest has subsequently cooled . West Ham hope that Alvarez , who is expected to sign a long - term contract barring any last minute complications , will be the first of up to half a dozen new signings at London Stadium . The club are gearing up to compete in the Europa League after winning last season ' s Conference League , but haven ' t added to their squad yet and have seen captain Rice leave for Arsenal in a British - record £ 105m deal . Another central midfield arrival is high up on West Ham ' s transfer agenda , while they would also like to sign a new central defender , left back and centre forward as a minimum - the need for the latter highlighted further by the club agreeing to send Gianluca Scamacca back to Italy just 12 months into a five - year deal . Atalanta confirmed his arrival from West Ham in a deal worth £ 26m on Monday , allowing the Premier League side to recoup the majority of the money they paid Sassuolo in July 2022 . Arsenal have submitted an opening offer for Brentford goalkeeper David Raya , 90min understands . Brentford have made it clear all summer that they are prepared to sell Raya , who is in the final year of his contract , for £ 40m - an asking price which scared off Tottenham before they signed Guglielmo Vicario instead . After expressing an interest in Raya earlier this week , Arsenal have now opened the bidding with an offer which 90min understands is closer to half of Brentford ' s asking price . An initial £ 20m has been proposed , with Arsenal also prepared to pay up to £ 5m in potential add - ons . Brentford are expected to reject the offer as they stand firm on their asking price . Manager Thomas Frank recently insisted £ 40m is cheap for Raya , pointing to Arsenal ' s decision to sign another player in the final year of their contract , Declan Rice , for £ 105m . feed Arsenal are not alone in their pursuit of Raya , with German giants Bayern Munich also keen on the Spaniard as they seek to replace Yann Sommer , who is expected to join Inter . Sommer has acted as cover for the injured Manuel Neuer after the German broke his leg following the conclusion of the World Cup but is expected to leave this summer and Bayern are keen to move for Raya , although Brentford ' s asking price continues to prove problematic . Raya himself confessed earlier this summer that he feared Brentford ' s £ 40m demand would price him out of a transfer , although the 27 - year - old vowed to respect his club ' s decision and remain focused on the job if he is not granted an exit . As for Brentford , they have already signed a replacement for Raya , striking a deal to recruit Dutch international Mark Flekken from Freiburg last month . Roberto De Zerbi admits he ' s unsure what the future holds for midfielder Moises Caicedo but says Brighton will sign " another important player " if he leaves . Chelsea have seen several bids rejected by Brighton , the latest of which was worth £ 80m . The Seagulls want £ 100m to sell their star midfielder and recently made it clear to Caicedo why they are holding out for such a fee . Amid the uncertainty , Caicedo was left out of Brighton ' s final friendly on Sunday - a decision which chief executive Paul Barber publicly claimed was down to injury . " Moises had a slight hamstring injury late in training and was pulled out for that reason , " Barber told Brighton media . " With a Premier League season just a week away it makes no sense to risk him today . We re looking forward to Moises starting the season with us , he s a Brighton player under a long - term contract . " feed After the game , De Zerbi kept the focus on the transfer uncertainty surrounding Caicedo , confessing he did not know when he would see the Ecuador international again . " I don t know [ if he ' ll be back in training tomorrow ] , " he said . " If Moises leaves , we will find another important player . And if Moises stays , I will be happy for us , for the team , for the club . But it s not my problem now . If Moises leaves , we will bring another player in . " We are Brighton , and under our policy there is the possibility to lose some players at the end of the season . It was the same for [ Alexis ] Mac Allister and [ Levi ] Colwill . " 90min understands that Chelsea are expected to return with an increased offer for Caicedo , but have been searching for alternative targets amid concerns over the price tag . Barcelona have made fresh contact with Manchester City ' s Bernardo Silva , confirming their ongoing work behind the scenes to put together a deal to sign him , sources have confirmed to 90min . City have already informed Silva and his entourage that they do no want to sell him this summer and have outlined their plans to make him one of the highest paid players at the club alongside Kevin De Bruyne and Erling Haaland . However , with Barca ' s interest reigniting , 90min understands Silva has again made it clear to City and Guardiola that he would like to leave the club - the Portuguese international said the same 12 months ago but was asked to stay for another season , at which point the Premier League champions would look at letting him leave as long as their valuation of around £ 80m was met . But the departures of Riyad Mahrez and Ilkay Gundogan have seen City change their stance on Silva and now insist they can ' t afford to let him leave , even if a club agree to meet the valuation - something Ligue 1 giants Paris Saint - Germain have already indicated they would be willing to do . Now Barca , who are set to pocket nearly £ 60m from the sales of Ousmane Dembele and Franck Kessie , are trying to package together a deal that will convince City to let Silva go , having previously thought a deal was unattainable because of their precarious finances . feed Barca are also locked in talks with City over the future of Joao Cancelo , who has agreed personal terms , and they hope they can come to agreement that will take both Portugal internationals to Catalonia this summer - but sources have told 90min that as it stands City will not sell . Speaking after City ' s Community Shield defeat to Arsenal , which featured Silva from the start , manager Pep Guardiola was asked about his future and also that of Bayern Munich target Kyle Walker , who also featured at Wembley . He s [ Walker ] super important for us . Hopefully he can stay . We have one more year of contract , it ' s not the end so if someone wants him they have to talk , like Bernardo Silva . We want them to stay . They are so important for us , " the Spaniard said . West Ham United have made a second bid for former Manchester United captain Harry Maguire , sources have confirmed to 90min . The Hammers are looking to strengthen their squad with as many as six signings before the transfer window closes , but have only signed Cliftonville youngster Sean Moore to date . The club is yet to splash any of the immediate cash received from Declan Rice ' s £ 105m British - record move to Arsenal . A deal for Ajax midfielder Edson Alvarez is nearing completion after a fee was agreed and West Ham have now returned with another offer for Maguire after an initial approach was knocked back at the end of July . Sources have confirmed to 90min that West Ham ' s new bid is worth £ 30m , though any deal , should United decide the fee is enough , is likely to hinge on the 13 - time Premier League winners continuing to contribute towards Maguire ' s hefty wages . United manager Erik ten Hag has established Raphael Varane and Lisandro Martinez as his first - choice centre - back duo at Old Trafford , with Victor Lindelof and Luke Shaw , naturally a left - back , also ahead of Maguire in the pecking order for places . feed Maguire has also been stripped of the club captaincy this summer , in favour of appointing Bruno Fernandes , and United are willing to sanction his exit if they receive an offer that they believe reflects his market value - they paid Leicester £ 80m for his services in 2019 . West Ham are continuing to show interest in Maguire ' s United team - mate Scott McTominay , sources have further confirmed to 90min . An offer of £ 30m has been made by the Hammers for the 26 - year - old Scot and talks are ongoing between the two clubs over a potential deal . The Hammers have returned to McTominay after deciding against pursuing Southampton ' s James Ward - Prowse . However , neither Maguire nor McTominay are itching to leave Old Trafford , with both players hopeful of featuring in the new season . Monaco ' s Youssouf Fofana is another player front and centre of technical director Tim Steidten ' s transfer plans , with West Ham also wanting to sign a left - back and striker before the window closes on September 1 . Levi Colwill and Chelsea have reached an agreement for a new long - term contract to run for six years , 90min understands . The England Under - 21 international spent the 2022 / 23 season on loan at Brighton and impressed under Roberto De Zerbi . The Seagulls were keen to sign Colwill permanently and readied a club record offer , while the defender waited for talks with new Blues manager Mauricio Pochettino before deciding his future . Colwill now believes he will feature under the former Tottenham boss at Stamford Bridge , 90min understands , and has agreed the terms on a new contract with Chelsea which will runs into the late 2020s . The 20 - year - old ' s current deal has two years left to run with the option of a further season . Brighton admitted defeat in their pursuit of Colwill as the west London side stood firm in their ' not for sale ' stance before interest from Liverpool emerged . The Reds plucked him out as a top target as Colwill revealed his desire to play regularly . feed He said in early July : " I ' ll speak to my family , speak to everyone I need to and make a decision . I ' ve got to play at the end of the day , to hopefully get there and go to the next [ England senior ] camp . " Pochettino ' s squad is still being streamlined before the transfer window closes but Thiago Silva , Benoit Badiashile and Trevoh Chalobah are among the Argentinian ' s alternative options to Colwill . Wesley Fofana has suffered another injury setback and won ' t feature in the early months of the 2023 / 24 season . The Blues are closing in on a deal for Monaco centre back Axel Disasi , who will reunite with former teammate Badiashile if a transfer worth in the region of £ 38m goes through . Rasmus Hojlund will travel to Manchester on Tuesday for a medical ahead of sealing his move to Manchester United , 90min understands . After lengthy negotiations with Atalanta , United have agreed to a deal which will see them part with a guaranteed 75m ( £ 64m , $ 82 . 3m ) , with a further 10m ( £ 8 . 6m , $ 11m ) in potential add - ons , to sign the 20 - year - old striker . With personal terms agreed earlier in July , all that is left is for Hojlund to pass his medical and sources have confirmed to 90min that the Dane is due in Manchester on Tuesday to undergo his checks . Should all go to plan , Hojlund will become United ' s third signing of the summer , following Mason Mount and Andre Onana in agreeing moves to Old Trafford . Denmark teammate Christian Eriksen recently gave fans an insight into what they can expect from Hojlund , telling PA : " What ' s he like ? He ' s a strong number nine . He ' s developed a lot in the last year from when I first saw him with the national team [ to ] a year ' s time , so , yeah , he ' s a very good player . " feed Eriksen continued : " I suppose we don ' t get enough media attention in Denmark that ' s why , so people outside Denmark don ' t know enough . " He ' s a nice guy , he ' s a good player . Like I said , he ' s developed , turning into just a nine , which he ' s played for the national team . " I have to be honest I haven ' t seen that many games for Atalanta , but I know how they play and he fitted in well there , so , yeah , he ' s a good player . " United have endured a mixed bag on their pre - season tour of the United States , beating Arsenal 2 - 0 at SoFi Stadium but also losing to Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund . A youthful team also lost 3 - 1 to Wrexham , who were promoted to the Football League last season after pipping Notts County to top spot . Fabinho ' s transfer to Saudi Pro League champions Al Ittihad has been confirmed , bringing the Brazil international ' s five - season stay at Anfield to an end . The midfielder was a crucial starting XI member under Jurgen Klopp during memorable Champions League and Premier League successes but now joins Nuno Espirito Santo ' s side who have also recruited Karim Benzema , N ' Golo Kante and Jota this summer . There were concerns the move could fall through due to issues relating to the proposed payment structure , but the deadlock was soon broken and Fabinho underwent a medical . A statement from Liverpool ends : " Everyone at Liverpool FC would like to thank Fabinho for all of his contributions to the club ' s successes during the last five years . " Fabinho becomes the second Liverpool midfielder to seal a move to the Saudi Pro League after former club captain Jordan Henderson left Anfield to reunite with old teammate Steven Gerrard at Al Ettifaq . feed The former Monaco star made 219 appearances in total for the Reds after moving to Anfield in 2018 , scoring 11 goals . As well as the Champions League and Premier League successes , Fabinho also won both the FA Cup and Carabao Cup during the 2021 / 22 campaign . The midfielder was picked out for criticism as Liverpool struggled to mount a challenge for Champions League qualification in 2022 / 23 , leading the Reds to strengthen central areas early in the summer transfer window . Alex Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai have been brought in from Brighton and RB Leipzig respectively , while long - time squad members James Milner , Naby Keita , Roberto Firmino and Alex Oxlade - Chamberlain have all departed . Tottenham Hotspur are progressing in talks to sign Micky van de Ven from Wolfsburg , sources have confirmed to 90min . Spurs have been on the hunt for reinforcements at centre - back following a Premier League campaign which saw them concede a staggering 63 goals - the third worst record among teams that were not relegated to the Championship . New head coach Ange Postecoglou has made public his desire to bring in new defenders this transfer window , with 90min previously reporting that Van de Ven and Bayer Leverkusen ' s Edmond Tapsoba were their top targets . Bayer Leverkusen ' s demands of a fee in excess of £ 43m for Tapsoba may have proven too much for Tottenham however , as 90min understands they are now advancing with a £ 35m deal to bring in Van de Ven from fellow Bundesliga side Wolfsburg . feed The 21 - year - old has played 41 times for Wolfsburg since his 2021 move from Dutch second division side Volendam , announcing himself as one of Europe ' s top young defenders . After a delay in finalising the deal , Spurs are also expected to complete the signing of highly - rated 18 - year - old Ashley Phillips from Blackburn Rovers this week . Meanwhile , 90min reported earlier on Wednesday that Tottenham had held talks with Barcelona regarding the potential re - signing of former loanee Clement Lenglet if deals for either Tapsoba or Van de Ven fell through . Barca are determined to move on from the France international this window . Newcastle United have agreed a transfer fee with Southampton for full - back Tino Livramento , sources have confirmed to 90min . It is understood the deal is worth around £ 35m to Southampton with another £ 5m in add - ons , although a sell - on clause will means at least 40 % is due to former club Chelsea . Livramento is now due in the north east for his medical ahead of putting pen to paper on a long - term contract which is already agreed . Newcastle have been wanting to bolster their full - back option this summer and Livramento emerged as their top target . The 20 - year - old can play on both sides , whilst current right - back and Kieran Trippier can also switch to the left offering additional options to Eddie Howe . The Livramento deal will represent Newcastle ' s third major transfer of the summer following on from the captures of AC Milan ' s Sandro Tonali and Leicester City ' s Harvey Barnes . Overall , it takes their spending for this transfer window through the £ 100m barrier . 90min understands that a right - sided centre - back and a ' number 10 ' remain in their sights . Financial Fair Play ( FFP ) issues are a consideration for Newcastle and are anxious not to breach the regulations . But they are exploring additional options such a possible loan deals with mandatory fees which will allow them to circumnavigate some of those concerns . feed 90min can also confirm Newcastle are also continuing to work hard on finalising a new contract for Brazilian star Bruno Guimaraes . The 25 - year - old has been in talks over a new deal and personal terms are not seen as a major issue . However , the talks have stalled and Guimaraes himself recently admitted that he was not sure where the deal was and Howe is pushing for Newcastle to get it done . Howe said : " There is no doubt in my mind about his future . We would love Bruno to extend his time with us for a long time . I ' m not party to those talks every day . Those talks are ongoing and Bruno knows how we feel about him . He ' s very happy here . We hope there ' s a solution to be found . " Real Sociedad are looking to take Manchester United midfielder Donny van de Beek on loan with an option to buy , sources have confirmed to 90min . The Netherlands international has played 60 times for the Red Devils since joining from Ajax in 2020 , though most of these appearances have come as a substitute and his last two seasons have been plagued by injuries . The arrival of Mason Mount from Chelsea has pushed Van de Beek further down the Old Trafford pecking order and Man Utd are open to a departure during the summer transfer window , with 90min reporting during July that he was considering his options . 90min understands that Spanish side Real Sociedad , who have qualified for the 2023 / 24 Champions League , have stepped forward and offered to take Van de Beek on loan with an optional purchase clause . feed Man Utd are aware of La Real ' s concerns over the knee injury which prematurely ended his 2022 / 23 season and so are willing to sanction a loan , with the two clubs in talks over the sum of the option to buy . Van de Beek is keen on a move to San Sebastian . Sources have told 90min that Man Utd are looking to free up space on their wage bill with the departures of Van de Beek and fellow midfielder Fred in order to push ahead with a move for Fiorentina ' s Sofyan Amrabat . 90min reported last month that Man Utd have held talks with the Italian side over a transfer , but face competition from Atletico Madrid . While their search for a new midfielder rumbles on , Man Utd will soon announce the signing of striker Rasmus Hojlund from Atalanta following his medical . The 20 - year - old Denmark international will join for an initial £ 64m fee , with add - ons potentially taking the total sum to just over £ 72m . Manager Xavi has confirmed Ousmane Dembele has requested to leave Barcelona after agreeing personal terms with Paris Saint - Germain . France international Dembele became one of the most expensive players ever when Barca paid Borussia Dortmund an initial £ 97m in 2017 , with add - ons potentially taking the deal up to £ 135 . 5m . Dembele suffered consistent injury issues in his first few years at Camp Nou but returned to form last term , contributing five goals and seven assists in 25 La Liga games . However , his six - season stay in Catalonia is expected to end soon . 90min reported earlier this week Dembele has agreed personal terms to join PSG on a five - year deal , with the Ligue 1 holders also in talks with Barca over a fee to sign the France international . Following Barcelona ' s 1 - 0 pre - season win over AC Milan , Xavi confirmed to Relevo Dembele ' s desire to leave and admitted he is not happy with how the situation has played out . The former Spain midfielder said : " I will be very clear , he has told us he wants to leave , he has a proposal from PSG and we can ' t do anything . " It leaves a bitter taste in my mouth because we have taken care of him so that he is happy here . A little disappointed , yes I am . " feed Barca have been in talks with the forward over a new deal , however Xavi has revealed the club could not financially compete with the contract offer tabled by PSG . He added : " We cannot compete with the proposal that they ' ve made to him , it ' s out of our reach . " It ' s simple . He came to me with a proposal from PSG . Said that he wanted to leave , that he had spoken with Luis Enrique , with Nasser and has a proposal with which we cannot compete . We have asked him the reason and he has not been able to answer . I sense that it will be something personal . Disappointed ? Yes . The important thing is that he has been clear . I wish him luck . " He looked so happy to me , I did not expect it . That is the market . Whoever doesn ' t want to be at Barca , you have to let him go . " Sadio Mane ' s proposed transfer to Al Nassr in Saudi Arabia is set to see former club Liverpool miss out on a chunk of extra income . The deal agreed between Liverpool and Bayern Munich for Mane last summer started at around £ 27 . 5m in a guaranteed transfer fee . But the overall package was inflated by £ 7 . 5m worth of add - ons that were dependent on the player hitting certain targets in Bavaria . Such performance - based add - ons can often include things like appearances or goals . But Mane didn ' t have a particularly good debut season with Bayern , playing only 25 times in the Bundesliga , scoring just nine league goals and generally underperforming . manual At one stage , Mane was internally suspended by Bayern and fined a club record amount for lashing out at teammate Leroy Sane , with coach Thomas Tuchel eventually concluding that the Senegal international had fallen ' short of expectations ' . Now that he is set to move on from Bayern to join Al Nassr , the Daily Mail has reported it will cost Liverpool . The various add - ons in the 2022 transfer agreement didn ' t end up being triggered and are set to be lost as soon as the player has a new club . Liverpool would have been hopefully of those add - ons being achievable , yet now won ' t see that additional money coming in . Mane was initially resistant of a switch to the Saudi Pro League . As 90min reported at the time , Al Ettifaq were the team initially interested in signing the 31 - year - old . However , not long after making clear his intention not to engage with talks , Mane agreed personal terms with Al Nassr in principle . Newcastle United have confirmed the departure of French winger Allan Saint - Maximin , who has completed his move to Saudi Arabian side Al Ahli . Saint - Maximin spent four years at St James ' Park , racking up 124 appearances in all competitions and chiming in with 13 goals and 21 assists for good measure . He is now set for a new chapter in the Middle East with Al Ahli , becoming their fourth blockbuster addition after the signings of Edouard Mendy , Roberto Firmino and Riyad Mahrez . " Four years ago , I wore the Newcastle jersey for the first time . At that moment , I hadn t realised that not only was I about to become a Newcastle player , but I was also about to become a Geordie , " Saint - Maximin wrote to fans on Twitter . " You might think ' nice goodbye message ' but the sentiment runs deeper than any words I could say , from the very first months that I met the people of this city , I truly understood them and embraced their unwavering passion , which is why it was so important for me to give my all and if this meant to play injured or even not making statistics , I didn t give a s * * t as long as it would help my team . feed " Believe me , I fell for Newcastle , I had great opportunities to leave during dark days , but that was too late I was already in love , I wanted , I needed , I had to stay for helping my team to save the club from Premier League relegation because it meant the world for me . " Of course during those dark days some may have had their doubts , but I always believed in this club and look where we are today , it ' s just so beautiful . I ' m leaving Newcastle as it should always have been and that ' s my greatest trophy because I was a part of it . " A deep thank you to ALL of you , my teammates , the loyal fans , the staff , the Club , etc . I ve seen all your messages , thank you and even though this chapter has ended , the story never stops . Newcastle is home now , I ' ll continue to be your biggest supporter , I ' ll watch every game and as long as the club keeps winning I ' ll be the happiest man in the world . . . and for sure you will see me again . " I love you , I love you sincerely , I love you like a Geordie brother . Once a Geordie , always a Geordie . " Barcelona winger Ousmane Dembele is closing in on a move to French champions Paris Saint - Germain . 90min understands that he has agreed personal terms over a move back to his homeland and could even be unveiled as a new PSG player by the end of the week . It will bring an end to Dembele ' s six - year stint in Catalonia - a spell which has been largely underwhelming considering the promise he arrived with and the 145m ( £ 125m ) total fee paid to Borussia Dortmund . PSG will fork over 50m ( £ 43m ) for Dembele . Here are the players Barcelona could , and perhaps should , recruit with that sum . feed Head coach Xavi admitted earlier this week that he is in desperate need of a new natural right - back . " The right - back is a position that we should look at again , and reinforce , " he said . " We have players who adapt but they are not in their natural positions . We will see how everything turns out and how we also fit into financial fair play . " Few modern day full - backs fit the Barcelona mould the way that Joao Cancelo does . 90min reported on Wednesday that Barca are reigniting their interest in the Portugal international having tried but failed to sign him during the January transfer window . Barcelona would prefer to take Cancelo , who has four years left to run on his Manchester City contract , on an initial loan with an option to buy . Classic Barca trying to kick the can down the road . Right , let ' s move on to actual winger targets and not just any old player that Barcelona are actively talking about . 90min reported last month that Man City were battling PSG and RB Leipzig for Lyon winger Bradley Barcola , seeing him as a potential replacement for Riyad Mahrez . Barcola ended his breakout 2022 / 23 season with seven goals and ten assists in 35 games for Lyon . If Barcelona want one of Europe ' s up - and - coming wide threats , then they should consider entering these sweepstakes . Villarreal winger Yeremy Pino is quickly announcing himself as one of Spanish football ' s top prospects . He has spent three full seasons in the Yellow Submarine ' s first team and was part of their Europa League - winning contingent of 2021 , while he played a starring role in Spain ' s Nations League triumph in June . Pino ' s 80m ( £ 69m ) release clause may prove prohibitive to Barcelona unless they shift a few more players , such as Tottenham targets Franck Kessie and Clement Lenglet . This would be a highly ambitious move and one that would stretch Barcelona in a financial sense , but Joao Felix is a player that would love to make the move and would certainly raise the technical levels of La Blaugrana . In fact , Felix recently discussed his desire to play for Barcelona in an interview with Fabrizio Romano , saying : " I ' d love to play for Barca . Barcelona has always been my first choice and I ' d love to join Barca . It was always my dream since I was a kid . If it happens , it will be a dream come true for me . " The endless link . Bernardo Silva has continually been tipped to leave Man City and it is usually Barcelona touted as the destination . Barca are still interested , but due to the aforementioned sale of Mahrez , 90min understands that Siva will be staying put at the Etihad Stadium . A versatile Ajax forward who has World Cup experience but has only been linked with a move to the Premier League ? This sounds like something Barcelona should be all over . Mohammed Kudus has been the rare shining light for both club and country over the last year , turning on the style in poor Ajax and Ghana teams . 90min understands he is wanted by Arsenal , Chelsea and Manchester United , who could all probably out - bid Barcelona if push came to shove , unfortunately . Electrifying and fleet - footed , Jeremy Doku would make for a nice project to succeed Dembele . The 21 - year - old hasn ' t quite kicked on since his marvellous performances at Euro 2020 but he has continually been linked with the continent ' s biggest clubs . Why couldn ' t it be Barcelona that takes a punt on his potential and upside ? Bayern Munich CEO Jan - Christian Dreesen and technical director Marco Neppe are due in England on Monday for their next meeting with Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy to discuss the future of Harry Kane , 90min understands . After holding a meeting with Levy earlier this month , Bayern had planned for a second set of face - to - face talks with the Spurs chairman last week but saw those plans pushed back at the last minute . Now , the two Bayern officials are expected to front a group of Bayern representatives which will touch down in London on Monday for their long - awaited talks over Kane ' s future . Two bids from Bayern have already been knocked back by Levy who , up to this point , has not named an asking price or even given any indication that he would be prepared to accept a bid for his talismanic striker this summer . However , with Kane entering the final year of his contract , Spurs owner Joe Lewis has intervened and is understood to have told Levy to authorise a sale if an agreement to extend Kane ' s contract cannot be struck . feed A club - record bid from Bayern , whose transfer record currently stands at the 80m paid to sign Lucas Hernandez from Atletico Madrid in 2019 , is expected to arrive imminently , with the German side determined to take advantage of Kane ' s expiring contract to get a deal done . There has been plenty of speculation over the reason for the cancellation of last week ' s meeting between Bayern and Spurs but the German side ' s president , Herbert Hainer , insisted there was nothing malicious going on . " Sometimes people read too much into normal processes , " Hainer told TZ . " What I can say is that Daniel Levy is a professional . We all have the utmost respect for him . " Tottenham have agreed to meet the £ 13m release clause of Rosario Central youngster Alejo Veliz , 90min understands . Spurs recently opened talks with the Argentine club for 19 - year - old Veliz , who had also attracted interest from AC Milan , Roma , Salernitana and Nottingham Forest . The 19 - year - old rose to global prominence during the 2023 FIFA Under - 20 World Cup as part of Argentina ' s squad , scoring three times before his side were knocked out in the last 16 by Nigeria . Rival interest had arisen from Serie A and the Premier League but 90min has been told the young striker made Tottenham his preferred destination which has helped with negotiations . A long - term contract is in the works and no issues are expected to flare up between Veliz and Spurs in that department . Veliz scored 11 times in the 2023 Argentine Primera Division , only two fewer than joint - leading scorers Pablo Vegetti and Michael Santos . He made his debut for Central in 2021 during a Copa Sudamericana clash with Deportivo Tachira and has since netted 19 goals in total for the club . feed Discussions are now being held over Veliz ' s short - term future . Rosario are keen to keep the teenager - who turns 20 in September - until January on loan and possibly beyond . Tottenham have long needed back - up options for Harry Kane , whose own future in north London is under extreme scrutiny with Bayern Munich confident of completing a deal for the England captain . Richarlison suffered an injury - hit first campaign with Spurs but would be the obvious replacement up front if Kane does leave before the season starts . A central defender is still being targeted with talks advancing for Wolfsburg ' s Micky van de Ven as new head coach Ange Postecoglou looks to fix a defence that conceded 63 Premier League goals last season . Out of favour Barcelona duo Franck Kessie and Clement Lenglet - the latter of whom spent last season in north London - remain targets , while Denmark international Pierre - Emile Hojbjerg could be shipped off to Atletico Madrid . 90min rounds up the latest transfer news , rumours and gossip circulating around the world . . . Paris Saint - Germain forward Kylian Mbappe has made it clear that he would be prepared to join Chelsea this summer , but only for one season as he still has his sights set on a free transfer to Real Madrid in 2024 . ( Sport ) To replace Mbappe , PSG are closing in on the signing of Benfica striker Goncalo Ramos , who will cost close to £ 70m . ( A Bola ) Ousmane Dembele will also join PSG from Barcelona , who will not sign a direct replacement for the Frenchman and will instead put their faith back in young Ansu Fati . ( Sport ) Harry Kane would be open to signing a new contract with Tottenham if they show significant progress under new manager Ange Postecoglou . ( Evening Standard ) Spurs face competition from Saudi Arabian outfit Al Nassr over centre - back Clement Lenglet , who could move to the Middle East from Barcelona for £ 13m . ( Sport ) Attempts from Manchester City to renew Kyle Walker ' s contract have fallen flat , with the England international keen to join Bayern Munich this summer . ( The Athletic ) manual Chelsea face competition for Brighton midfielder Moises Caicedo after an unnamed club saw a bid rejected which exceeded the Blues ' latest offer of £ 80m . ( Athletic ) That mystery club is Liverpool , who are on the lookout for another new midfielder . ( Football Insider ) Manchester United have now joined Liverpool in pursuit of Southampton midfielder Romeo Lavia . ( Independent ) Talks have also been stepped up between Man Utd and Bayern Munich midfielder Leon Goretzka , who wants to stay with the Bundesliga champions . ( Sky Sports ) Tottenham are close to striking a deal to sign Rosario Central striker Alejo Veliz , who is expected to be sold for above his £ 13m release clause . ( German Garcia Grova ) Inter have expressed an interest in Arsenal defender Takehiro Tomiyasu . ( Gazzetta dello Sport ) Barcelona winger Ousmane Dembele is in line to complete a move to Paris Saint - Germain by the end of the week , 90min understands . 90min reported on Monday that Dembele had agreed personal terms over a move back to France , which came as a bit of a shock to the footballing world considering there had been little speculation suggesting he was looking to leave this summer . Barca head coach Xavi and new club captain Sergi Roberto have both spoken of their surprise and disappointment of Dembele ' s fresh intentions to leave . Sources have now confirmed to 90min that PSG are closing in on the signing of Dembele after paying a 50m ( £ 43m ) release clause in his Barcelona contract . With that money , the Spanish champions will step up their pursuit of Manchester City ' s Joao Cancelo . Xavi spoke earlier this week of his desperation to bring in a new right - back and the sale of Dembele should allow them further flexibility in the summer transfer market . feed PSG are hoping to finalise Dembele ' s move by the end of the week , and 90min understands they are also looking to push through a move for Benfica forward Goncalo Ramos in that timeframe as well . Both head coach Luis Enrique and sporting advisor Luis Campos are keen to add Ramos to their ranks . The French champions previously held an interest in Manchester United - bound Rasmus Hojlund . Ramos is expected to arrive for a fee in the region of 80m ( £ 69m ) , while PSG retain an interest in his Portugal teammate Joao Felix . The 23 - year - old spent the second half of last season on loan at Chelsea but has since returned to Atletico Madrid . PSG ' s negotiations with Atleti are not currently advanced , though the deal is not completely dead yet . Barcelona midfielder Nico Gonzalez has completed a transfer to Portuguese giants Porto . Spain Under - 21 international Nico made his Barca debut in 2021 under Ronald Koeman , having renewed his contract that year until 2024 with a whopping 500m release clause . His deal at Camp Nou was then extended to 2026 before departing for a loan spell with Valencia . Things went poorly at the Mestalla as Los Che narrowly avoided relegation in 2022 / 23 , with Nico scoring once in 26 La Liga appearances . feed Barca have now announced his permanent 8 . 5m departure to Porto , who finished second in the Primeira Liga , and have a buy - back clause should they wish to bring the midfielder back to Camp Nou . The La Liga giants also retain a percentage of any future transfer fee for Nico . New summer arrivals Ilkay Gundogan and Oriol Romeu made Nico ' s pathway to starting XI football more difficult under Xavi , who already had the likes of Pedri , Gavi , Frenkie de Jong , Sergi Roberto and Franck Kessie to choose from in midfield . He is the latest Barca player to leave this window following the previous exits of Sergio Busquets , Jordi Alba , Samuel Umtiti and Alex Collado . Alongside Gundogan and Romeu , the reigning Spanish champions have also brought in Inigo Martinez on a free transfer from Athletic Club and signed Brazilian forward Vitor Roque to come into effect in 2024 / 25 . They are hopeful of completing more business before the window closes , too . Barca have long been interested in Manchester City ' s Bernado Silva , though the treble winners are ready to stand firm to stop the Portugal international leaving following the recent departure of Riyad Mahrez to Saudi Pro League side Al Ahli .
